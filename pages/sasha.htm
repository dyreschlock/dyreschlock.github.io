          <font color="#333333" size="2">yeah, anywho...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">what a spectacular weekend we had at 
          the Quest listening to the gods of trance.. it was packed the likes 
          of which i've never seen before ... but it was full of very many, many, 
          many negative atributes.. such is the price to see Sasha and Digweed 
          though...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">negative experience #1 : it was crowded... 
          and like i've already said.. its never been this crowded... you could 
          hardly move in the crowd and when someone did, they usually forced their 
          way through.. violently.. pushing and shoving was amuck and it was something 
          i wasn't very keen to...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">negative experience #2 ... because it 
          was crowded.. and everyone was moving ... the heat level rose quite 
          high ... and there was every kind of man stink and woman stink in the 
          air .. ack ... after being on the dance floor for a total of 3 some 
          hours.. i could take no more .. and once you left the dance floor.. 
          you ain't getting back...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">negative experience #3.... &quot; the 
          talent does not want their picture taken... if you are caught with a 
          camera inside.. you will be removed along with your camera... and your 
          film will also be removed... &quot; ... nothing was worse than this 
          ... son of a mother fucker... this pissed all of us off... </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">negative experience #4... some of those 
          lights were pointing at the exact wrong place... if not being able to 
          take pictures was bad enough ... most of the lighting effects we went 
          to highlight the crowd so that Sasha and Digweed could take clear pictures 
          of us ... and these weren't just ambient lights... this was like staring 
          into the high beams of car coming straight at you around 11 o'clock 
          at night ... very bad for the retinas.. i wish i would have broughten 
          in my blue specs.. oh well ....</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">negative experience #5.. once i get 
          back to school i have ungodly amounts of homework due the exact next 
          day ... i had a program to finish, a paper to write, a friend who needed 
          C++ tutoring, and then spamm to attend ... which is the rason you are 
          getting this update now instead of monday night... this wednesday morning 
          is the first spat of free time i have ... phew...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">anywho... such is the price to pay to 
          fulfill a life long dream... the whole expexience is still quite on 
          the positive end of things ... Sasha and Digweed truly are the gods 
          of trance.. and i salute thee... i would have bought a Delta Heavy Tshirt 
          but i didn't want to spend $35 on something that didn't even have Sasha 
          or Digweed printed on it ^_^ ...</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" color="#333333"> ... Well that sunday night was fun 
          and boring in a way.<br>
          Lets just say I was on the dance floor and was trying to<br>
          dance but...them drunks were like in my way. I mean<br>
          gee they are to drunk and are trying to dance. There<br>
          was this one guy. I don't know if Stu talk about him too.<br>
          But he was dancing with every one. Guys girls you name it.<br>
          He was drunk and was getting every one to dance. Stu was<br>
          right there were to many old people. I saw some people there<br>
          from plush (the saturday night gig) and that was cool. I also<br>
          saw to many gay people. I just could not stop laughing at them.<br>
          It was funny I look to my right and I see two guys up and close.<br>
          At first it was sick but then again I laughed. Then I looked back<br>
          to the show from a far. I had fun yes.... Was I there to dance to<br>
          Sasha's music. Yes I was. But I had to sit down. I got a headache<br>
          from standing in that crowd. I was bumped into and bitched at for<br>
          pushing back.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">But on the bright side. Sasha and John 
          Digweed played some nice sets.<br>
          The energy they made was just great. I read some were that Sasha<br>
          watchs the crowds actions. And he builds off of that. That person is<br>
          so right. John Digweed also spun a nice moving set also. Them two<br>
          are just a great duo. I mean I have to say they top all my fav DJ's.<br>
          hahaha</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="#333333">But there I am done. Time to close my 
          rant good bye.<br>
