Silent Hill is a franchise that I have very little interaction with, but I was very intrigued with the setting in this new game. It takes place in a rural Japanese mountain village in the 1960s, a location and time period I am very interested in. Recently, I have done a lot of research and traveling to similar old abandoned buildings and villages up here in the mountains. Its fictional town of Ebisugaoka even uses a nearby village as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Silent Hill f is an incredible work of art that continues to build its story on its fringes. I think it also builds a desire for knowledge about its themes and history, so people find themselves reading every note and scrap of paper they find. Everything forms together to create an overall picture I have tried to capture in this writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the story is told through multiple playthroughs, and this post spoilers and tries to explain everything. I have spoiler warnings as the post goes on, but if you plan on playing Silent Hill f, I would suggest not reading too far. Experience the game for yourself, and come back later. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silent Hill from the point of view of Silent Hill 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silent Hill is a horror game series, and it refers to the name of the town where the game takes place (Silent Hill, Maine, USA), inspired by Stephen King novels and Twin Peaks. The overall series of games is like an anthology. Each game focuses on different characters when they find themselves in the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I think, I have only played Silent Hill 2 back in the day on Playstation 2. I played through the game and got a couple of the endings. I never played the first game. I skipped it because it looked like a cheap version of Resident Evil. The second game felt like a better realized version of what they wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a dense fog in Silent Hill, and within the fog, people who come to the town become lost and trapped. The fog becomes a metaphor for the turmoil and sadness in their lives, and those fears become physical manifestations. For example, there is a character who has often been rejected in their life, so the town feels cold and dark to them. He is often heard talking with nameless figures who don't return his gazes or conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the tamer examples. Silent Hill features a lot of grotesque imagery and gore. These are physical representations of equally grotesque mental and physical abuses. Another woman, as the fog creeps in and alters the world into its netherworld state, views the buildings and walls as flesh. It often pulsates and pistons are shown violating it, refering to violations of her in her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't remember a lot about the actual story in Silent Hill 2, but I vividly remember a &lt;b&gt;plot twist&lt;/b&gt; when other characters mention they haven't seen any monsters or grotesque creatures out to get them in the way you have. These monsters were unique and emblematic of your own haunted past, and beating them down is another way of the game showing how your character deals with his fears. Supress fear and trauma, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silent Hill f's Role in the Silent Hill series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silent Hill f departs from many of the ideas of the main series. The largest being the timeframe and setting. The game does not take place in Silent Hill, Maine, but takes place in Ebisugaoka, Japan around the early 1960s. (There are various dates on calendars in the game showing 1960 and 1962.) (I'll get back to this later, but Ebisugaoka was inspired by Kanayama village in Gero, Gifu, near where I live.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our main character is also a large departure. We play as Hinako Shimizu, a female high school student. You aren't playing as a man with a flashlight, looking for his lost wife or daughter or whatever. As the writer explains, women in Silent Hill have traditionally been victims and suffered from the actions often determined by their male protagonists. He wanted to make a Silent Hill story where a woman had control of her own story and trauma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the game begins, you have a fight with your parents and run into town to find your friends to talk. When talking with your friends in the town's center, the fog creeps in and consumes the town. Then monsters begin to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another departure from the main series is the singular focus of the threat. Your friends can see the same monsters just as plainly as you can. You all run away from them chasing you, and avoid them as much as possible. And they can die to those same monsters. While characters in previous games had their own fears raelized within the fog, this circumstance seems entirely based on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although...  Are your friends real? The fog creates a dream-like state that makes it hard to tell whether or not this is actual reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Netherwold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous games, a siren would blare through the fog and the real world seemed to alter and change into a darker version of itself. This is where monsters would appear and attack you. The Netherworld of Silent Hill f is a different plain of existance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of sequences in Ebisugaoka, Hinako will hear a pounding sound that knocks her out. When she wakes, she appears in an ethereal world of Japanese spirits with a man in a fox mask guiding her forward. She seemingly has no choice but to follow him and solve various puzzles to push her way forward, bringing her closer to the fox mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progression in Silent Hill f bounces back and forth between these two worlds as you discover more about yourself, your friends, and the overall story that explains these events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Atmosphere and Tension through Sound&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Akira Yamaoka&lt;/b&gt; is back! Yamaoka has been doing sound and music for the Silent Hill series since the beginning. (One of his earliest projects as Konami was converting sound and music for Snatcher to Sega CD and other CD platforms! Big fan!) Silent Hill 2 was his first project as a full lead for sound design and music at Konami. And he continued that role with Silent Hill 3 and especially Silent Hill 4 having more control as Producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One aspect of Silent Hill f that feels greatly heightened compared with previous titles is Yamaoka's sound. Silent Hill 2 was always eerie and atmospheric. There was that hum in the background, and the scratchy static of your pocket radio as you got near certain areas of importance. It built tension and uneasiness. But, it's impact never really stayed with me. It kinda felt like a gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until Dead Space where it felt like sound design could become the centerpoint for forcing immersion you couldn't ignore. Music and sound in games has always been important, but both Dead Space and Silent Hill f overpower you with sound. It's like an assault on your ears and it conveys an overall sense of dread and danger as monsters lurk and hunt you. Occassionally, monsters will hide in the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silent Hill f does have some ballads, but most of the music heard through normal gameplay doesn't have a lot of strong melodies to grasp. It often feels like chaos with pounding taiko drums, sharp twangs of Kote, and other unnerving sounds from traditional Japanese instruments mixed with modern electric guitars. It feels like chaos, but its organized chaos. In some ways it feels like a modern society being held back by its traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Headphones are necessary&lt;/b&gt; for the full experience. You feel completely immersed in the situation, setting, and story, and sometimes it gets so loud, you want to cover your ears, but you can't. The sound sometimes makes you feel like you're struggling to break free, much like our main character, Hinako.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes (Spoilers)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite wanting to give women more agency, Hinako often takes a very passive approach to any slights or aggressive towards her (at least in the beginning). When it sounds like your friends are talking behind your back, you say nothing. When your "boyfriend not boyfriend" Shu asks you your feelings, you don't answer directly. Also, you seem somewhat controlled by the fox mask in the netherworld. These microaggressions do build, but they are compounded by the overall theme of Hinako's trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Hinako hated playing with dolls and loved playing outdoor games with Shu. They often played this make-believe space wars game together and ran around the neighborhood "shooting aliens." But, everyone thinks this is odd and makes snide comments about how she'll never get married if she gets scars. They yell at Shu as well to stop playing with girls. But they still play together, and refer to each other as their partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this forced separation, boys and girls don't talk to each other with familarity or as equals. (A bit of this is lost in translation with the English dub.) As teenagers, this separation is pushed further as they are now nearly adults. Society forces Hinako to act more like a woman. It's weird that Shu treats Hinako like a true friend and an equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their behavior particularly annoys their friend, Rinko, who has a crush on Shu. Their behavior makes Rinko incredibly jealous, especially when Hinako doesn't seem to put any thought into being a girl or even acknowledge any possible romantic feelings Shu might have for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinako's hatred towards forced gender roles goes further when you learn more about her family. Her father is abusive. He is verbally and emotionally abusive to his wife and daughters, and we read later that he is also physically abusive to his wife, Hinako's mother. He takes the frustrations of his life out on them by always yelling, and blaming his faults on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His actions are reenforced by society's standards (1960s rural Japan), and it's rather common behavior for men. Women are subordinate. You read later that other households in Ebisugaoka tend to be the same. Hinako finds a letter from a woman terrified of her life from her husband beating her. But she can't run away and leave her children behind. "Life is too hard to keep living, but I'm forbidden to die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinako hates him for all of his abuses, and she hates her mother, too, because she always takes his abuse, and she always covers for him, lies for him, and defends him. In a flashback, Hinako actually stands up against his abuses by yelling at her father, pointing out his mistakes, and yelling at her mother asking why she doesn't stand up to him. But, by society's standards, Hinako is the one out of line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of them yell back at her. The mother defending the father, and the father acting out against her. To end this argument, her father throws his large cooking knife at her, and it sticks in the ground at her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall forced gender roles is the center of Silent Hill f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game you face against grotesque monsters that follow this theme. You fight female mannequins who are puppets to someone else's wishes. Blind male monsters who want to grab you, beat you, and lick you. Faceless brutality. Male monsters with multiple heads and eyes looking all directions spewing bloody bile on the ground spreading their filth. And bloated pregnant monsters spawning more puppets. Gross, but it's inventive how Silent Hill f creates its own monsters rather than relying on Japanese yokai for designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game continues to build as you meet the physical representation of the fog, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forced Decision (Huge Spoilers)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narration leaves you in the dark on a lot of details surrounding Hinako, her friends, and family. These details slowly reveal themselves through reading newpaper snippets and documents found throughout the game, and some dialogue between characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinted and foreshadowed at the beginning, Hinako must make a decision, although this decision is forced on her by her father. That decision is a &lt;b&gt;marriage proposal&lt;/b&gt;, which terrifies Hinako.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does marriage actually mean in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edo Peroid Japanese Marriage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After World War II, so many of Japan's old ways were revised and "modernized" with a new constitution. Some of the largest changes were women's rights, many of which were only recently ratified in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pre-modern Japan (up through the 1860s), the concept of households became the basic building block of society. A household, or your family unit, not only determined your social status and role in society, but defined you as a person. To build a family and serve your household was your purpose in life, and supporting you family above your own interests was paramount. Wikipedia mentions a quote, "the choice to remain single is the greatest crime a man could commit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The father was head of the household and he was legally responsible for all family members. (This also means that his family members were legally bound to him.) Finding marriages for his children was one of his main responsibilities. Love and feelings had nothing to do with marriage, and it was seen as childish and improper to have any kind of preference in a spouse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman married, she married into the other family. Wikipedia mentions that the old word for marriage in Japanese was &lt;i&gt;yomeiri&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;span class='ja'&gt;嫁入り&lt;/span&gt;. When you separate the bits of kanji apart, it says, "the woman enters (or joins) the home." The other household takes the woman into theirs, and she abandons her old household and her old family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of her new household, she basically becomes a maid. Men were taught and encouraged to place the needs of their parents and children before the needs of their wife. Another fun Wikipedia quote, "If you love your wife, you spoil your mother's servant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meiji Period Japanese Marriage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Meiji Restoration (starting from around the 1860s), these ideas not only continued but somewhat strengthened. Rapid industrialization and urbanization brought more families together into densely packed cities. Public education became more and more universal, which pushed family roles and gender roles as a matter of fact. People were to first devote themselves to the nation, then to their family, then to themselves, and fill their roles within. Women were taught as daughters to obey their father, as wives to obey their husband, and as widows to obey their sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was extreme segregation of genders during this period, too. Boys and Girls were separated at schools and social gatherings. Unwed men and women who became romantically involved could be fired from their jobs or even arrested (in WWII). Another quote, "It is deemed a sign of mental and moral weakness to fall in love."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As education for women became more common, women began to fight back. Wikipedia mentions that Japanese women's fight for divorce around 1900 was the beginning of Japanese feminism. Though, it wouldn't be until the 1920s when they had their first success changing a single law. The fight continued for decades about voting rights, divorce, and other antiquated laws until their whole government was rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-War&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Japan's surrender in 1945, the United States rewrote and rebuilt nearly all aspects of Japanese government which trickled into Japanese society. Women had their voting rights, divorce rights, and were now legally equal. "All people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of creed, sex, social status or family origin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, writing this down on a piece of paper and saying its true, doesn't make it immediately true in the eyes of people who have lived for centuries under the opposite idea. It takes time for change, and even more time in isolated rural villages where people tend to follow their own laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia Sources: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Japan#Edo_period_(1600%E2%80%931868)" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Japan#Edo_period_(1600%E2%80%931868)"&gt;Japanese Marriage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism_in_Japan" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism_in_Japan"&gt;Japanese Feminism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bride Price or Dowry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing to point out is that through arranged marriages, it was a tradition for the groom's family to "pay" the bride's family. Often the "price" was meant to boost their bride's family status to become more equal to that of the groom's. I think families always tried to bargin their daughters off into equal or weathier families, never down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting a smiley face on it, it's a showing of appreciation to the bride's parents for raising such a good (or obedient) daughter. You could also maybe think of this as compensation for losing a family member. Or, you could think of it how it actually sounds, human trafficking. Seems like fathers were barginning for their daughters and being sold as property, especially if their new household legally "owned" them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think in some areas and families in Japan, bride prices may still be practiced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forced Decision (back to Silent Hill f)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Silent Hill f's first playthrough and first ending, all the hints and signs come together that Hinako is being forced to marry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her path in the real world is her true self. Her friends are killed one by one, and her parents are killed in front of her. In marriage, she would be torn away from her life, so her friends and family of her past life would be as good as dead to her. You also read random snippets of newspaper saying Shimizu Hinako has disappeared or died. Through marriage, she would be erased from town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward trying to find a way to fight the fog, the fog slowly consumes and corrupts town with entrails, pulsing flesh, and red blighted flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her path in the etheral world changes her. Fox Mask leads Hinako down the hallways of ceremony and rituals. Her arm is sawed off and replaced with another. A massive hanko burns and melts a new family crest into her back. And her face is sliced off and replaced with a mask that matches Fox Mask. Hinako is becoming his property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very end of the ceremony, she quivers and collapses as red blighted flowers consume her body. Then she rises as a faceless woman in a Shiromuku &lt;span class='ja'&gt;白無垢&lt;/span&gt;, the traditional Japanese wedding dress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120212725.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120212725.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120212725_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120212725_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120212725_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the figure driving the fog in town. As Hinako faces the Shiromuku in town, she kills you and takes over your life in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As true Hinako, you wake in the etheral world of rituals. Your true self has not been fully snuffed out. And you face against the Shiromuku. &lt;b&gt;(Ending 1 Spoilers)&lt;/b&gt; After defeating the Shiromuku, the enemies come pouring in after you. As you beat them down, you flash back and forth between the celestial plain and the real world. The corruption goes away and is replaced with police sirens and flashing lights. It becomes known as the wedding massacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ending 1 makes sense, but it's also a bit of a let down. Hinako became so consumed with fear of marriage that she killed her family and friends at her forced wedding. We're never really told who she married, and everything (all the monsters and etheral world) just being a hallucination throws away many of the themes and imagery built up over the course of the story. It feels empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the game isn't over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Replay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ending 1 hints at the red pills you've been taking the entire game to refill health as sinister. After making a completion save, the menu maps out requirements for multiple endings, a total of 5. Ending 1 is the "red pill" ending and you're forced into it for your first playthrough. Other endings can be achieved by avoiding them all game. Completing a &lt;b&gt;second&lt;/b&gt; playthrough can result in one of two endings. And then a &lt;b&gt;third&lt;/b&gt; playthrough is required to get the final fourth ending. (There's also a secret goofy fifth ending available in the second playthrough.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When starting a second game, cutscenes are different and there are more pieces of information available to find. You are given a more direct information and explanations on what's going on and how everything is connected. Not including the goofy ending, the other endings make full use of the themes and imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;稲荷神&lt;/span&gt; and Foxes &lt;span class='ja'&gt;狐&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major spiritual theme of Silent Hill f focuses on &lt;b&gt;foxes&lt;/b&gt;. Maybe that's what the f stands for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225026.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225026.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225026_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225026_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225026_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, Japanese folklore treats foxes as mischievous spirits who always try to trick others into doing what they want or giving away what they treasure. The moral of the story is to not trust a fox. Although, often foxes end up getting comeuppance for their deads, so the other moral of the story is to not be a fox. Don't trick or deceive others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, foxes aren't all bad. The bad ones often take human form. The good ones are more of a component of nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inari Gods in Shintoism began as gods to worship to protect or increase yields in rice farms. Foxes became associated with them because they are a natural deterrent against rodents who destroy rice fields. Foxes eat those rodents, and through some evolutionary traits, fox urine has become a natural repellent for rodents. Folks in olden times would present a fox urine soaked rock as an offereing to an Inari shrine. Thanks for the piss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In folklore, foxes tend to be loyal to their debts. Good deeds are often repaid. And bad deeds are often met with mallice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ebisugaoka (Silent Hill f), the main shrine in town is the Sennensugi Shrine, which worships the Inari god. Its on the top of a hill in the north, but it has fallen on hard times through the urbanization of Japan and its aging population. For the older generation, its inconvenient for them to climb the hill when they want to pay their respects, so they just use one of the small roadside Inari shrines that are all over town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your friend Sakuko is the last in line of the family who administrate Sennensugi Shrine, and her grandfather is head priest. As mentioned, people don't visit the shrine anymore because its up on the hill, and her father doesn't really care for the religion. He refused to take over as head priest, and works an office job instead. As such, her grandfather remarks that the shrine will die with his generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some notes in the game remark that a god's power is only as strong as people's belief and worship in that god. With more people devout to them, their power and protection grows. There is a reciprocal bond between humans and gods, and the stronger the bond, the more prosperous the relationship. As the number of worshippers wane, so does the god's power and protection. Its also worth noting that discretion of Inari shrines in town results in mysterious horrible grotesque deaths, so people always respect Inari, whether they want to or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakuko is a miko of the shrine, and she loves it. She often thinks about being head priest in the future and how she can restore the shrine. Mikos are shrine maidens who perform spiritual cleansings and provide individual rites to people for protection and healing. (spoilers) She's the first to die. This basically signals that all the good will towards foxes is now gone, and they no longer have any obligation to provide protection. As soon as she dies at the beginning of the game, the fog grows and consumes the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fox Possession &lt;span class='ja'&gt;狐憑き&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox Possession is a key theme used for our groom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japanese folklore, it's possible for anyone to become possessed by a fox spirit, but it is most common when a person caters to a fox spirit in exchange for some kind of magical services. Once a man is possessed, this possession extends to their family and is passed down to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While good deeds are repaid with good deeds, a deal where "you do this for me and I'll do this for you" is employment, and foxes will always take advantage of the situation. If a fox spirit is constantly appeased, the possessed is often given good fortune. However, this often comes at the expense and tragedy of others. For example, some foxes would bring their masters money, but it was stolen from their neighbors. Foxes are also known to cause illness and death towards the possessed's enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is later revealed that our groom is &lt;b&gt;Kotoyuki Tsuneki&lt;/b&gt;, and there's a long line of notes you find that describe his and his family's past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tsuneki family is the most notable and rich family in the area. They live somewhere outside of Ebisugaoka, but their pressence is known throughout the region. There's a saying that the Tsuneki family always has good fortune when the world is in disorder, hinting at their connection to fox magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day years ago, the hier to the Tsuneki family saw the most beautiful farm girl. Being of a far lower class, they could never marry, but he still courted her and they had a secret affair. Months later, his father found a suitable wife for his son, so the beautiful farm girl was cast aside even though she was pregnant with his son. She was banished into the mountains, and lived in Ebisugaoka. This was Kotoyuki's mother, and a few months later, Kotoyuki was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, his mother always forced Kotoyuki to focus on his studies. "You are the true hier to the Tsuneki family. You can't waste your time playing games. You are an adult in a child's body, and you will rise as the head of the Tsuneki family." Kotoyuki hated this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 9, Kotoyuki was playing in town with other boys. It was not uncommon for wild foxes to come into town. Older generations know how to treat the animals with care, but the younger generation don't understand this and try to chase and provoke them. One day, a wild fox attacked Kotoyuki in town, leaving deep cuts on his face. Young 5 or 6 year-old Hinako "saved" him by treating the fox with kindness. "It's just sacred. Please go away fox." In a note later, Kotoyuki remarks that he just met the most beautiful girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His cuts festered and boiled into a fever of 40 degrees. He lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital. By the time he reached the hospital, the cuts were gone. At one point he woke up with a glassy look. Nurses asked his name, but he couldn't remember. Physically, it was like nothing had happened at all. But, mentally, his mother remarked that he felt like a completely different person. He no longer cared about games, and devoted himself completely to his studies. You later find a note that says, "I must become the perfect match for Hinako."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also find this quote, "If a fox falls in love at first sight, they will try to steal her away as their bride."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later, the head of the Tsuneki family (Kotoyuki's father) and his wife contracted an unknown illness. They had high fevers, and their skin had sores. Some days, they would vomit profusely. A few days later, their son and daughters began showing the same symptoms. A few days later still, the father and mother died and their corpses were bloated and disgusting, emitting a horrible smell. Their only son's illness also grew, and he met the same fate. They were immediately cremated, and none of this news was ever publicized. Though, with the death of all hiers, the daughters made a miraculous recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their symptoms and deaths are consistent with other medical notes you find about drunken members of town desecrating Inari statues and foxes in Ebisugaoka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not mentioned in the game, but this was probably around the same time middle-school-aged Kotoyuki played a game of &lt;b&gt;Fox Gathering&lt;/b&gt; with his friends at school. Fox Gathering is like a seance where kids each write their names on a board, turn out the lights, and sing the Fox Gathering song in a circle. When the lights are turned back on, each name is given their future. All these futures are bad except for one person. Kotoyuki's name was the only one not crossed out with the message, "All your dreams will come true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say that a fox gathering isn't just a way of telling someone's future, but often foxes will that future to become reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the head of the Tsuneki family dead and his son, too, the grandfather sends a message to Kotoyuki's mother to legitimize Kotoyuki as the new hier. They move away from Ebisugaoka, and Kotoyuki becomes &lt;b&gt;Kotoyuki Tsuneki&lt;/b&gt; head of the Tsuneki family. He has now returned for Hinako's hand in marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fox Wedding &lt;span class='ja'&gt;狐の嫁入り&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's clear that Kotoyuki has been possessed by a fox and that the Tsuneki also has strong ties with fox possession. The concept of a fox wedding has more meanings than just this literal case, and it connects with the ideas of gods marrying mortals, which is referred to as a "hierogamous marriage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hierogamous marriage becomes beneficial for both sides of the marriage. A mortal becomes divine, and the god stengthens its ties with mortals. As mentioned before, a religion prospers when more people devoted to it. As gods gain more strength, so does their protection for the mortals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in Ebisugaoka have coined the phrase "fox wedding" in a similar way. When a woman is married, they abandon their home and are wisked away. It's like they have disappeared. So when a young girl goes missing and is never found, they call it a "fox wedding." Some wealthy fox lord scooped them up in marriage, and now they're living in a life of luxury without care. Despite the heavy feeling of loss, families are somewhat comforted by this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, weddings between gods and mortal are rare. So when a god searches for a bride, they want to find a rare and exceptional match. In nearly 100,000 births, a girl is born with an exceptionally rare blood type. People often say that these girls are "blessed by the stars" because of their blood type. You find a note in the game from a woman named Mayumi who had a rare ABO blood type and was married to a fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Hinako saying she is unremarkable, it is heavily implied that she also has a rare blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is what a fox wedding actually looks like. In Japanese folklore, a fox wedding happens around dusk when someone sees a trail of lights leading through the forest. These lights are lanterns held by foxes in a wedding procession. The above painting near the end of the game depicts a classic scene of a fox wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yamata no Orochi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;八岐大蛇&lt;/span&gt; and the origin of Ebisugaoka's faith&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inari Faith and foxes are just one side of the coin. Ebisugaoka's Inari faith is an amalgamation of the town's original beliefs that span over a millennia. And it all began with the Japanese myth of Susanoo defeating the evil eight-headed dragon Orochi. In battle, Susanoo got the dragon drunk on strong tubs of sake, and sliced off its heads one-by-one. (Remember &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/okami" title="/okami"&gt;Okami&lt;/a&gt;??)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of its heads flew away and crashed in the mountains of Higa becoming a poisonous water dragon plaguing the land where it fell. Because of the poisonous water, few people ever went to this area, and it only became inhabited when shamed defeated warriors of the Taira clan found refuge hiding here. Higa later became known as Ebisugaoka. People believe that this legend stemmed from the occassional toxic gas leaks in underground water streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of the area idolized the poison water dragon as a means to protect themselves from its poison. This was the area's original faith. After this, nearly 800 years ago, a freakishly tall monk wearing multiple masks came to the area. He brought the people to a great cedar tree and told them to devote themselves to it. "This great tree saps evil from the water dragon below. Devote yourselves to this tree, and it will qwell the beast to the end of time." This began the faith in the Divine Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Ebisugaoka was remote, it was impossible to trade items with other towns, so people had to treat their tools with the utmost care. As tools became spent, people would bring their tools to the divine tree as an offering. This would grow faith and power in the divine tree. Over time, this custom began more and more common that people had forgot these offerings were meant as tribute to seal the water dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This twisting of the Divine Tree faith had formed the Tsukumogami faith. More respect should be given to things the more they age. Thus, the older something becomes the more respect it should have and the more divine it becomes. The Tsukumogami faith also believes that when objects have existed for so long they gain a spirit of their own. Because the divine tree was the oldest object in town at nearly 1000 years old, it was the center of the Tsukumogami faith. A shrine was built around the tree on the west end of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that when the disgraced warriors of Taira clan settled the area, they vowed revenge against the members that banished them. Their weapons and gear had been lost to time, maybe destroyed or traded away. But one sword still remained in Higa (Ebisugaoka), and it soaked in the feelings of revenge and malice from the former clansmen. Through the Tsukumogami faith, this sword now had a life of its own and remained hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through some puzzle solving in the second playthrough, the lost sword, the &lt;b&gt;sacred sword&lt;/b&gt;, reveals itself to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Edo Period (1600s / 1700s), lightning struck the thousand-year-old divine tree, and the fire spread to burn the tree and the shrine. People believed that the tree had lost all of its divine power, so through the Tsukumogami faith, they searched for the next oldest object in town to praise. This was a moss-covered Inari statue north of the divine tree in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inari priests told the townspeople that an ancient evil water dragon was set free from the divine tree now that is has lost its power. But, the foxes are here to protect you. A family of foxes rose up to save our town from this threat. They hold the dragon at bay, but our faith in them gives them power. We must devote ourselves to them to receive their protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, Ebisugaoka's faith changed again, now to the Inari faith. People began praying to the Inari for protection, but it was warped and twisted with Ebisugaoka's history of faith. It became confused with the ideas of the Tsukumogami faith. Over time, the Inari faith in Ebisugaoka became its own branch of the religion, almost completely different than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the moss-covered Inari statue was not the oldest object in town. This was the sacred sword, which was infused with its own spirit of revenge in the true faith of Tsukumogami. On the inside, it was considered blasphemy that the people would abandon their faith. On the outside, knowing the sword's existence could destabilize the Inari faith in town. The sword wanted its revenge against the foxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final bit of history was a murder spree that happened in the 1880s. A man over two feet tall covered in tree bark came into town with a sword and killed everyone he found worshipping Inari statues. He called everyone hethens for not respecting faith to the Divine Tree. The water dragon will rise again because of your blasphemy. Legend says that the spree ended when a thick fog rolled in carrying a pack of foxes which devoured him completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, with faith in the Inari wanning, there are some people who believe the town is cursed because they no longer truly devote themselves to the religion. In 1945, there were a series of small earthquakes and an onsen geyser erupted in town nearly 30 meters high. The water spewed a noxious hydrogen sulfide gas, and tests later showed it contained high levels of arsenic. People claim this caused sores and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alert was issued by the Disaster Prevention Division stating these small earthquakes could be a sign that the "big one" is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Player Choices and Further Endings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By starting a New Game+, Hinako is armed with the knowledge of the red pills. She also has a fox brooch pinned to her lapel giving her the protection of Kotoyuki. Knowing the sinister nature of the red pills, avoiding them puts you on a path with two outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to find the sacred sword, and then determine whether to purge its life or keep it. By keeping the sacred sword as is, you will have its protection in the final battle. By purifying the sword of its vengeful soul, its protection is gone, and you rely on the protection of the fox brooch in the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a third option available in your third and final playthrough by giving up both the sword and the brooch, relinqushing Hinako of all outside protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The red pills were protection given by Shu. The sacred sword was protection given by your past. And the brooch was protection given by Kotoyuki. Each of the four main endings align with the actors behind the protection. Once you reach your house, the Shimizu residence, in the last third or quarter of the game, you are locked into an ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you shift through different layers of your warped home, you confront images of your past and finally confront yourself, which are all different depending on which ending you're locked into. Later at the end, you face the real threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping the Sword's Protection (Ending 3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hinako faces herself at home, her other self is terrified, weak, and completely panicked at what to do. Your journey throughout the game was killing your friends and family as a way of leaving them behind as you leave home in marriage. Your decision is ultimately choosing to kill your other self, or be killed. The panicked Hinako begs for death. Her face peels away to become what you hate the most, the bride. You are the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the end, as true Hinako, fox Hinako turns into the Shiromuku and you fight. You win, but Kotoyuki interferes. His body controts and transforms into a massive ratty matted nine-tailed fox. His handsome kind persona is completely dropped, as he screams and threatens you. "I have shown you nothing but kindness, but you refuse it. So I will take what it rightfully mine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By retaining the sacred sword with its full power, the sword is able to amplify the part of you that strongly holds on to the past. Throughout the game in the fox realm, this is represented by your old childhood doll, reminding you of who you are. Your true self is able to shine through any influence of your transformation by Kotoyuki. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon defeating the ratty fox, Shu appears and confesses his love for you and that he would do anything to protect you. He throws himself at the wounded fox, but you stop him. Leave him alone. You and Shu run away from the shrine, and appear in town. Hinako tells him that she can't marry Kotoyuki, and they run away together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the credits, a radio program reports that Ebisugaoka was consumed with Hydrogen Sulfide gas (the fog) and the entire town was evacuated. With Kotoyuki completely rejected and defeated, it seems like the divine protection of the Inari faith has collapsed. And ultimately, it seems like the sacred sword with the spirit of Tsukumogami had got its revenge. With the Inari faith gone, the poisonous water dragon was let loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Removing the Sword's Protection (Ending 2)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hinako faces herself at home, her other self screams at you for being childish. She screams at you to die die DIE! You find some letters in your drawers from Kotoyuki about the courtship showing him as loving and caring. Your face peels away to become what you hate the most, the bride. You are the antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the end, as fox Hinako, true Hinako becomes warped and distorted, moving like a puppet seemingly controlled by a dark force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spirit is easily snuffed out by Kotoyuki. Then Shu appears and exasperatingly confesses his love for you. He screams how he should have told you all of his feelings from the beginning and that he wants to be with you always. He also confesses that he used the red pills to try and break you free of this marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old tools, weapons, and masks consume his body. As fox Hinako, you finally defeat the last remaining bit of your past self, and can continue forward as wife to Kotoyuki Tsuneki. Shu accepts that Kotoyuki would make a fine husband for Hinako and gives him a fist bump as the morning sun rises to vanquish the horrible night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the final spirits of the Tsukumogami faith purified, and the wedding succeeded, the Inari faith has been appeased. The water dragon, hydrogen sulfide gas, fog, and mist all dissipate to reveal a clear day. The new day shines bright on Ebisugaoka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ends in a pretty goofy way, and everything seems all happy and perfect on the outside with smiles. But after the credits, the severed sliced off face of true Hinako lies on the ground in terror, sobbing, and begging for recompense. "I'm so sacred. I don't want to become my mother. He will become my father." Then her face is crushed and wiped away, implying that she lives in true terror every day on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two Sides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both endings show the duality of the situation. Refuse the wedding and defeat the part of you driving you towards it. Or accept the wedding and defeat the part of you driving you away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By refusing the wedding, Hinako breaks away from her father's control, and puts her with Shu. She didn't want to get married, so Ending 3 should be a good ending. But the outside world shuns them. The game portrays the two of them running away into an uncertain future as hopeless and pessimistic. What future would they have by abandoning everyone they know? The fog turning poisonous and devouring the lives of everyone in town furthers this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, by accepting the wedding, everyone on the outside is appeased and happy. Hinako's family is now rich and debt free. Ebisugaoka looks bright, and Hinako's friends seem like they could live their best lives without her. Shu gives his blessing, and society continues to run and operate as it always has. Sounds good! But on the inside, society continues to rot and women live in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the alternative? &lt;b&gt;Choice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three endings so far, Hinako's choice has never been respected. She turns violent from the pills Shu slips her. She is forced to marry without a say. And by rejecting the marriage, she gives in to Shu, and is forced to cut ties with everyone she knows in Ebisugaoka. Ultimately, she never has a choice and has to comprimise her future either way. Once again we return to the theme of forced decisions on women in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choice (Ending 4)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Ending 2 and 3 make one of Hinako's sides the enemy. She's either the protagonist or the antagonist. By throwing away both the sword and the brooch, you aren't choosing to follow one side or the other. You are putting trust in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now when you face yourself at home, you listen to each other. You speak with your sister, and she listens and begins to understand your position. You listen to your mother and understand there are more dimensions to marriage. And your father begs forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society places the burden of forced decisions and roles on everyone. Men are also forced to act in certain ways to appear "strong" in the eyes of others. A father must assert his dominance. While this idea is true even in modern Japanese society (I have stories about this), I think it undermines the fear and abuse her father has caused. Hinkao can't forgive her father, but she recognizes that at least he respects her now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading into the end, Hinako realizes her situation fully. She says, "One of them wants to marry me off. The other wants to stop the wedding. Both of them are pitting me against myself. I will never be someone's puppet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By refusing Shu's red pills, by purifying the sacred sword, and by rejecting the fox brooch, you are able to see both forces driving your two halves against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the etheral plain, the gods having been using you for their own purposes. The Tsukumogami wants revenge on the Inari. The Inari wants its wedding to retain their power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nine-tailed fox adds the final piece connecting the Inari faith to the Tsuneki family. "Once in a blue moon, humanity will produce an extraordinary girl with divine power. When that happens, a spell is places on our clan's successor that stirs in him a desire to make that girl his wife."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fox wedding acts like a blood sacrifice. By joining the Tsuneki family to a girl of extraordinary rare blood, the fox gods are delighted and their power and influence grow. It's also noted that with this blood sacrifice, the woman is drained of all her blood, and her lifeless corpse is set adrift in the river as a means to bolster the imprisonment of the water dragon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both true Hinako and fox Hinako, you fight and defeat the Tsukumogami and Inari gods on mirrored plains of existence, ultimately proving that you are no one's puppet. Your life (lives) is your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the battle, even though Kotoyuki was under the influence of the fox spell, he ponders whether his feelings for you were real. And he vows to live his life and explore those feelings completely. He later writes you a letter saying that he is happy reliving a childhood he abandoned and still thinking of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You return to the real world in an abandoned Ebisugaoka covered in fog. In the end, Kotoyuki inspires Hinako. She wants to love someone as intensely as the love he showed for her. And if that someone is Kotoyuki in the future, then so be it. On the other hand, she wants to find her own passion, likes Sakuko's passion for her faith and Rinko's passion for Shu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the halves of yourself wandering the silent streets of Ebisugaoka, you want to focus on yourself. The town is now quiet and free of anyone telling you how to live, how to act, and how to be. You are free with yourself in your own &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201181705.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201181705.webp"&gt;Silent Hill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty beautiful ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, having defeated both gods protecting the town from the water dragon, it was released leaving the noxious fog to cover the town completely, forcing everyone to leave. Or also, with the town abandoned, all gods have lost their power, leaving fog to cover the town. Either way, only the water dragon remains and no one prays to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many mountain villages and settlements in the Japanese mountains have met a similar fate during the post-war Showa era. People leave their homes to find a better life in the now growing cities, and the original spirits of the mountain reclaim their land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through all of this myth, legend, and history, I think Silent Hill f is an incredible work of art that highlights many fears and problems with old Japanese society. Some of those problems still linger in their culture today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the game also gives hope for change. In the end, Hinako's father recognized he needed to respect his daughter. There are many families in my small town in the mountains where it seems like the father loves running around with their kids. Not many seem to follow the stoic Japanese father stereotype of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say the biggest problem with the game is that these layers are hidden behind a second and third playthrough. People will probably never see these ideas for themselves, and rely on YouTube videos (or reading this post) which don't give a first hand experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope more people find this game for themselves. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Below are many screenshots I took during my playthrough. I played using HDR so many screenshots were very dark. For those too dark, I increased their contrast and brightness to be more visible.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/silent-hill-f</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/silent-hill-f</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Game Thoughts</category><category>Games</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>Kanjouji Park Observation Point 閑乗寺公園展望台</title><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first mountains that creates the northern entrance to the Gokayama valleys is Mt. Yaotome. It separates the urban towns from the rural valleys, and it's the final obstacle for Sho River to break away from the mountains and continue straight north into the Sea of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the foot of the mountain on the urban side is Kanjouji Park, an elevated open area with lots of room for camping and outdoor activities. At the high point of the park is an observation point that overlooks Inami Town and gives a clear view of Nanto, Tonami, and even Takaoka, all of the western and southwestern open towns and cities of Toyama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_6556_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_6556_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_6556_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_6556_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_6556_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was cloudly and rainy most of the morning. But, by the time I visited the observation point in the afternoon, the weather had completely cleared. Much of the moisture remaining the air, though, so it was difficult to see the more distant areas past Tonami and Takaoka. But, all of the areas of Nanto were in full view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was around 2pm. Later, I came back around 5pm to watch the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7312_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7312_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7312_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7312_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7312_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the highlight of the park. The observation point faces northwest so it has a clear view of the sunset. Or, at least it would in summer when the sun would set a bit further north. Being winter, the sun sets early and further south. You aren't able to see the full sunset unless you go over to the raised concrete platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7341.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7341.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7341_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7341_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7341_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a very radiant sunset on a chilly evening. Even though we're in winter, it wasn't really that cold. And even looking across the miles of homes and towns, there's no snow. It's a really eerie feeling looking at a view that seems like October or November when we're in the middle of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stayed at the viewpoint for a while and watched as the orange hue faded into blue. As the blue color crept in, lights began to dot and brighten up bits of the towns and cities. More dots appeared as the blue deepend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7579.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7579.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7579_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7579_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kanjojji_viewpoint/IMG_7579_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My camera was not so great and capturing those subtleties. It doesn't really like low light, and with the sun gone, the chilliness began to turn into cold, so holding the camera still was a little more difficult. I left before it got really dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful place that I would love to see again in Spring as the view begins to turn green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/kanjouji-park-observation-point</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/kanjouji-park-observation-point</link><category/><category/><category>Mountains</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category><category/></item><item><title>Kitahara 北原 and Tochihara 栃原</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Kitahara and Tochihara areas of Toga valley and Otani valley are some of the first pockets of neighborhoods you encounter when traveling south and upstream along the Sho River &lt;span class='ja'&gt;庄川&lt;/span&gt; in southwestern Toyama. Kitahara is on the east bank of the river, while Tochihara is on the west bank and far higher up from the river side. Both areas had flat plateaus among the sharp cliffs, forests, and tough ground, which made them sustainable enough for people to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tochihara &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栃原&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After climbing up the cliff from the river on the west side, the area of Tochihara was quite wide. Among all the pocket neighborhoods and settlements of Toga Valley, it was quite populous with 217 residents in 32 households nearing the 1900s. As such, it was one of the first areas in Toga to get a branch school. Tochihara Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栃原分校&lt;/span&gt; was established in 1902 and stayed in use through 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tochihara became abandoned in 1976, but the area came to life again as a ski resort and farms. In the 1970s, Japan looked for open land to convert into rice farms to increase production to match their population increase. All the original homes were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, not much remains. The ski resort closed decades ago, and its final building was bulldozed last year. Digging and land moving equipment line the areas to quarry rock for construction projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that a small settlement known as &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/shimobara-winter-branch-school" title="/shimobara-winter-branch-school"&gt;Shimobara&lt;/a&gt; sits at the foot of Tochihara's cliffs, and is directly opposite from the river of Kitahara. Perhaps ironically, it seemed an annex of Tochihara in the beginning, but these days its the only place where people still live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kitahara &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北原&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the west bank, Kitahara on the east side has gotten more activity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toga bridge was completed 8 years ago, and it literally bridges the Kitahara neighborhood on the east bank to the west bank. It's a huge towering structure in the middle of seeming isolation, which seems weird considering hardly anyone lives in Kitahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's ultimate purpose is to lead traffic to a tunnel. The tunnel is currently under construction but when it's complete, it will bring people directly to the heart of Toga Village. Travel will be far more direct and safer in winter because of it. No idea when the tunnel will open but looking through Google Maps, construction on the bridge began nearly 13 years ago. Sometimes Japanese rural development is measured in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the bridge allows quick access to several hot spring hotels and guest houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, getting to Kitahara was not easy. The main route along the Sho River is on the west bank and Kitahara was on the east. The Sho River is very wide and deep, and the river banks have never high cliffs, so people could not easily go across. To the north, the Toga River splits from the Sho River, but the cliffs were still pretty steep. The original route to Kitahara had people cross the Toga River further south, and then climb over to the mountain to reach the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty in getting to Kitabara in olden times, many of the residents found the natural hot springs of the area incredibly soothing and relaxing. In winter especially, the hot waters helped keep everyone warm inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are still a few guest houses with onsens. The most impressive of these is an onsen hotel named Kitahara Sou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北原荘&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel was established in 1985 in an effort to revitalize the area. This was a decade after most of the residents had moved away. It has over a dozen full guest rooms and some banquet halls. Seems perfect for an office weekend retreat. The hot springs are separated for men and women, and both have an indoor bath and outdoor bath. I went here on a Sunday, and the baths had several patrons, so I couldn't sneak any photos inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baths were really nice, though. I sat outside in the heated bath, and could contrast between the 40 degrees of the pool and the 2 degress of the air. Unfortunately, I stayed in the pool a bit too long and started feeling dehydrated. I should've snuck in a large bottle of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water felt nice, and much of the hotel felt cozy. But peeking down the halls and looking into a few rooms felt very narrow and confined. In some ways, I felt trapped. It was a weird feeling that I hadn't really felt from any of the other remote places I've visited. Are there any Yokai that make you feel this way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't explore too much on the inside (I didn't want to burst into someone's occuppied room), but I looked around the outside. Japanese architecture in the 1980s was so fun and dynamic compared to the straight lines we have in buildings today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further up the road, past Kitahara-so is a guest house named the Toga House &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀之家&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was currently closed, or maybe only open through reservations. Next to the Toga House was the original site of Kitahara's branch school. The Kitabara Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北原分校&lt;/span&gt; was opened in 1902 with Tochihara's school, and was used through 1971. By then, there was an automobile bridge crossing Sho River, connecting the two sides, so any students living in the area could take a bus to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stays in the guest house are 7500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;, but that includes dinner and breakfast, plus use of their onsen. Some day, I would like stay there. Although, Toga valley is full of interesting guest houses with unique histories. There's another place I would be more interested in staying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitahara is a pretty remote place, but on this Sunday, there were more tourists around than I was expecting. Young folks and families stopped at the bridge to take photos. A few families stayed at Kitahara-so. And the river cruise on the Sho River was packed all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Toga Valley and Village has been bleeding a slow death over decades, there is still a market for tourism in its beautiful nature. Maybe that Toga tunnel will bring more folks into the village center, and bring money and tourism to town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/kitahara-and-tochihara</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/kitahara-and-tochihara</link><category/><category/><category>Urban Exploration</category><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Most Played Games in 2025</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This year, my gaming habits compared to recent years and continued moving away from Twitch and away from Pokemon. I spent a lot of time playing a few singular immersive games and working on gaming related projects. I also spent a lot of time exploring Japan, taking photos, and writing about the adventures, getting away from gaming screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modded Consoles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I'm most proud of the work I did on Gamecube and Dreamcast. After putting together a soft-modded Playstation in 2024, I wanted to have access to more games of that era. Many Gamecube and Dreamcast games were available on Playstation, but they weren't the same. Plus, they had tons of unique games of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ordered all the parts in January, but my consoles were back in the US. It wouldn't be until summer that I was able to retrieve them. In October, I finally put together &lt;a href="modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="modding-a-sega-dreamcast"&gt;&lt;b&gt;my Dreamcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And in November, I put together &lt;a href="modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;&lt;b&gt;my Gamecube&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both of them came together like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't had time to fully play any games on these consoles, but one of these days, I'd like to go back to Zelda on Gamecube, and some of the other goofy games on Dreamcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of projects, I spent the most time on Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My biggest games this year were those top three: &lt;a href="ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions" title="ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/horizon-forbidden-west" title="/horizon-forbidden-west"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows" title="/assassins-creed-shadows"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assassin's Creed Shadows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these games had a full immersive and expansive world that was fun to explore, for the most part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghost and Shadows were the most similar of the three. Both took place in fuedal Japan during pivotal moments in history that their stories built from. It's interesting how Ghost was basically a "good" Assassin's Creed game, so the franchise came back with a game that rivals it. Both games have strong points in different categories. Ghost has far more thoughtful gameplay and story. Shadows has a more expansive world and relateable characters. Ultimately, I far prefer Shadows for its exploration and beautiful scenery. Also, Ghost constantly throws sadness, rape, and death in your face which turned me off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being disappointed with Ghost, I bought a cheap copy of Horizon and I was very surprised and delighted. Horizon was an amazing experience that learned a lot from its first title. It's interesting how over the course of the long game, Aloy actually seems to grow and care about the new world compared to before. As such, I became interested in the other characters, too. Hopefully they'll be able to complete their trilogy without any compromises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also played through &lt;b&gt;Once Upon a Katamari&lt;/b&gt; in a weekend. This was the first new Katamari game in over a decade, and it was good! The new stages had a lot of variety and the settings were inventive. Unfortunately, I don't think they pushed creativity far enough. They should've added some totally new game modes, or a completely new unique graphical level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twitch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year, I was still streaming some games on Twitch, but after March, I quit. It wasn't fun anymore. Steadily, my gaming habits have returned to playing immersive and story driven content alone. When other people joined the stream to chat about unrelated topics or they aren't really following the same story or they complain about things, it was a distraction and took away from the experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's fine for games like Pokemon where the story doesn't matter and Twitch is just chatting with folks. It's not fine for the immersive games I wanted to play this year. When games got monotenous, putting on a podcast or a movie was much more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are my meager Twitch stats until I quit in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nintendo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on which, there was a new Pokemon game this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hours are midleading, though. My Switch was playing &lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A&lt;/b&gt; for nearly 300 hours, but it wasn't me playing it. After buying &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts" title="/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts"&gt;a controller with macros&lt;/a&gt;, the game could play itself and hunt for shiny Pokemon on its own. There were several days where I left everything on while I went to work, and came back 13 hours later to discover all the shiny Pokemon that had spawned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;b&gt;Pokemon Legends Z-A&lt;/b&gt; was my biggest disappointment of the year. The game is absolutely bland. Coming from Assassin's Creed Shadows with its beautifully detailed lifelike scenery to this boxy mono-colored environment was so hard. Obviously, the Switch can't do the same detail, but Pokemon Z-A has no style or life in its art design. It's so boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the story is repetitive and boring, too. I never once cared about anything that happened to any of the characters. Pokemon characters never really stand out as distinctive, and when Z-A puts them front and center, it really shows how flat they are. The plot and story progression follows the same boring predictable pattern throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst thing about this is its name, Pokemon Legends. Its predecessor, Pokemon Legends Arceus, felt totally fresh and fun. And building lore towards the overall Pokemon franchise was so creative. Pokemon Legends Z-A does nothing for the Pokemon franchise other than bringing in more Mega Pokemon. Coming from the first game, it's one of the most disappointing Pokemon games of all time. Awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I played &lt;b&gt;Tetris Effect Connected&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Tetris Forever&lt;/b&gt;, and both games are amazing. I never really connected with Tetris Effect before on Playstation, but the "Connected" release on Switch felt much better. I think I just needed to get past a lot of the early music in the game. Tetris Forever is an amazing interactive documentary of the game's history which is an absolute must-play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switch All-Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nintendo Year-in-Review also had a section of most played games throughout the system's life. This was also revealed recently through one of Nintendo's apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Animal Crossing is my all time most played game. There were so many days during Covid when I left the game running while I was trying to coordinate with folks online to buy items, or sell turnips, or buy turnips. Looking through that Nintendo app, I had a couple 18 hours days where the game was on, but I was doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, plenty of Pokemon and Zelda games on the list. Those are my most played and most owned Nintendo games of all time, so it makes sense that they would dominate the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steam?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also as a fun aside, after watching a YouTuber play through this fun highway creation puzzle game, I wanted to give it a try, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed my time with &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/freeways" title="/freeways"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Freeways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's easy to turn on the game, and try to get through a puzzle or two while watching a TV show at the end of the day. It was also only $5! So cheap!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Xbox?!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another fun aside, with Xbox basically going out of business in the next year, I downloaded my life time achievements stats from True Achievements. You can &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/xbox_alltime.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/xbox_alltime.webp"&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt;, if you'd like. Even though I bought a few Xbox One games and was close to buying an Xbox Series X two years ago, I haven't touched an Xbox since moving to Japan. My achievement story begins and ends with the 360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modded Console Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, with the Playstation 2, Gamecube, and Dreamcast working perfectly, I don't have any immediately plans to do more modding. But, at some point, I would like to have a modded platform for Xbox 360 games. I have no idea what that would be. I have no idea how to mod an Xbox 360 in the same way I've done it for my 2000s era consoles. But, when I feel like I have more peace of mind, I might start looking into it. I feel like that's in the distant future, though, as I have so many other games I want to play first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, modding a Wii or Wii U might come first. As much as I want to replay the Gamecube Zeldas, I really want to try Wind Waker HD on the Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaming in 2026&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this year, I hope to spend more time with my Gamecube and Dreamcast. I would love to replay Twilight Princess. Also with the VMU Pro, I want to try and play through a game that fully uses it. There are also more immersive games that I skipped in recent years. I want to play through the Alan Wake games. I also want to play Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2. I continually check Yahoo Auctions for cheap used copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the Super Station One is currently shipping. Maybe this will finally get me to go through Ocarina of Time, and maybe play Majora's Mask for the first time. Another playthrough of Snatcher could be fun, too. I could actually take a ton of screenshots this time. Also, there's the recent Super Nintendo MSU version of Castlevania II with the Disk soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many games. Too many hopes. I will probably just buy Death Stranding 2 and lose myself in it for a month or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/most-played-games-2025</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/most-played-games-2025</link><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>Toga Valley 利賀谷 and Past Schools</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Toga Valley is an area that cuts through the southwestern mountains of modern day Toyama prefecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole region of Toyama is known as Gokayama &lt;span class='ja'&gt;五箇山&lt;/span&gt;, which was named from the region being divided into five valleys coming down from the mountains. The five valleys are Akao Valley &lt;span class='ja'&gt;赤尾谷&lt;/span&gt;, Kaminashi Valley &lt;span class='ja'&gt;上梨谷&lt;/span&gt;, Shimonashi Valley &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下梨谷&lt;/span&gt;, Otani Valley &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小谷&lt;/span&gt;, and Toga Valley &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀谷&lt;/span&gt;. I talked about the history of Shimonashi Valley little bit in the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins"&gt;post about Hosoo Pass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of the five valleys follow the Sho River, which comes from the east side of Mt. Haku going directly north into the Sea of Japan. Toga Valley is different because it follows two different rivers. The Toga River comes from further east to join the Sho River at the base of the mountain. It also follows Momose River, which is further east and never joins either. As such, Toga Valley is almost completely cut out from the other four valleys and is far less populous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the river's edge meets the land, the forests begin. The whole area is over 95% deep forest. But, dotted along the cliffsides were several pocketed settlements back in the day with larger clusters up the mountain forming small villages of Toga, Sakagami, and Momosegawa. In 1896, the gun-district system was established which classified the entire Toga Valley as a single municipality, Higashi Tonami-gun Toga Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;東礪波郡利賀村&lt;/span&gt;. The entirety of Toga Village covered 176 square km.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its peak in 1947, the overall population of Toga Village was 4663. (&lt;a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) Today, it's around 400. It suffered the fastest rate of population decrease in Toyama prefecture in 2010 (-23% in 5 years), and it is one of the most depopulated areas in Japan. Because of that, there are a lot of abandoned buildings, including entire areas which no longer exist today. Last year (summer 2025), I visited the area 4 times because I was interested in the area's old schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;History of Toga Schools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first school built in Toga Village was &lt;b&gt;Shimo-Toga Public School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下利賀尋常小学校&lt;/span&gt; in 1892. This was 6 years after the Japanese government's executive order of primary education in Japan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小学校令&lt;/span&gt;, which ultimately stated that all children were required to attend and graduate 4 years of elementary school. With Toga Village established in 1896, the school was renamed to &lt;b&gt;Toga Public School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀尋常小学校&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toga's biggest problem was distance. Toga village began where the &lt;b&gt;Toga River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀川&lt;/span&gt; branched from &lt;b&gt;Sho River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;庄川&lt;/span&gt;. Toga River travels over 40km up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam, which forms a lake &lt;span class='ja'&gt;水無ダム湖&lt;/span&gt;. But, Toga Village also included around 10km along Sho River and the 20km stretch of the &lt;b&gt;Momose River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川&lt;/span&gt; in the east to its source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every 2-5 kilometers along the rivers was a small settlement. 2km doesn't seem all that far today, but in 1900, there were no paved roads or cars. (Cars only debuted in Japan in 1898!) People in the mountains traveled by foot (or rarely by horse). It was impossible for young students in the distant settlements to make the daily trip to school. This trip was even more impossible in winter when snow falls and blizzards cut off settlements completely from each other. (Not to mention the dangers of wildlife and insect attacks.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the distance education problem, branch schools &lt;span class='ja'&gt;分校&lt;/span&gt; were established. These were schools that branched from the main schools to treat students who lived in areas too far or too inconvenient away. They still operated under the jurisdiction of the main school but had their own branch principal and another teacher or two depending on how many students they had. Teachers couldn't be expected to make the daily trip to school either, so they lived in the school in their own living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1902, the first branch schools were established in &lt;b&gt;Tochihara&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栃原分校&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kitabara&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北原分校&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Sennohara&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;仙野原分校&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Takanuma&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高沼分校&lt;/span&gt;. These were all areas near the base of the mountain. It wasn't for another 30 to 35 years before more branch schools would open to treat students who lived on the top of the mountain with &lt;b&gt;Mizunashi&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;水無分校&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Okutaikanba&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大勘場分校&lt;/span&gt; branch schools, and another 6 winter branch schools would open for students who lived in between. I don't have all the data, so I think other branch schools opened in this time, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these were some of the most reglected areas in Japan for education. They didn't get money to build enough schools to reach all children. Most teachers also considered being stationed in these branch schools as punishment, too, because they'd be completely cut off from their own families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After World War II, education was restructured. All students were now required to attend 9 years of school. There was 6 years of elementary and 3 years of junior high schools. As the country rebuilt itself, it identified these remote schools as a problem and implemented the Remote Area Education Promotion Act (&lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95"&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;へき地教育振興法&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). More branch schools would be built in remote areas to obtain a near 100% attendance rate for schools. And, each remote branch school would now be given a grade (&lt;a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A"&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;へき地等級&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Remote Grade ranged from 1 to 5 and is determined based on the distance from transportation, hospitals, post offices, and grocery stores. It's also determined by the distance from the main school, city center, and board of education. When a teacher is posted at a branch school, their salary would be increased based on the Remote Grade of the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the educational restructuring in 1947, &lt;b&gt;Toga Junior High School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀中学校&lt;/span&gt; would open in the heart of Toga Village. The graduating class was only 17 students. In 1948, branch schools for the junior high opened in &lt;b&gt;Sakagami&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上分校&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Momosegawa&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川分校&lt;/span&gt;. The graduating class grew to 51 students. In 1949, more branch schools opened in &lt;b&gt;Okutaikanba&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;奥大勘場分校&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Takanuma&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高沼分校&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Shogawa&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;庄川分校&lt;/span&gt;. The graduating class was now 92 students. Each of these junior high branch schools just used the existing branch schools, which were still used for elementary school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population in Japan soured in the 1950s from 83.4 million people in 1950 and 93.2 million in 1960 (&lt;a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population" title="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). However, Toyama Prefecture remained mostly stagnant going from 1 million people in 1950 to 1.03 million in 1960 (&lt;a href="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015" title="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). And Toga Village had began its sharp decline from 4,663 in 1947 to 3,562 in 1950 to 3,038 in 1960 (&lt;a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the decade, more branch schools would open to cater to those who couldn't make the journey in winter. By 1959, the number of schools in Toga Village was at its peak. There were 21 total elementary schools (1 main school, 11 branch schools, 9 winter schools) (&lt;a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;), and the 6 junior highs (1 main, 5 branch). &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Through Internet researching, I could only find 17 elementary schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the dormatory at &lt;b&gt;Toga Junior High School&lt;/b&gt; was completed. All distant students now lived at school, which closed all junior high services for branch schools. More and more branch schools continued to close throughout the 60s as infrastructure was built. Roads were paved connecting all the settlements and more people owned cars so they could travel easily. They could also plow snow in winter easier which closed a significant amount of winter branch schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, the people in Toga have been pretty poor. The mountains were terrible for growing rice, so most people lived off of growing beans and buying food from selling silk and gunpowder. With the country booming, many families abandoned their old homes to move into cities where they could find decent work and make a much better living. This also closed many branch schools as their neighborhoods were vacated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This continued into the 70s. Tunnels were built between the mountains connecting each of the valleys, and expanded motorways were built, too, to make daily travel very easy. In 1970, the population of Toga Village shrank to 1,961, and by 1980, it was 1,328 (&lt;a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). In 1983, the graduating class of Toga Junior High School was only 9 students, the lowest to date. (There were 17 students in the class of 1984, though.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1990s, most of the branch schools had either closed or left dormant. In 1996, all remaining branch schools were officially closed and the government sold the buildings to whoever wanted them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the above school was built, the &lt;b&gt;Toga All Persons School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀アーパス&lt;/span&gt;. This huge building combined both Toga Elementary and Junior High together in a single building. There was also space for community classes, and had room for foreign students to study abroad from their sister city in Greece. Population of Toga was around 1,000 at this point and all students took the bus to school. Some students had an hour commute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, there were municiple mergers across Japan and Toga Village folded into Nanto City which now covered all of Gokayama and the towns and cities creeping into the urban area of Takaoka. Population was 855 at this point. By 2015, there were only 18 total junior high students, and 16 elementary school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, both elementary and junior high schools combined into a single school called &lt;b&gt;Nanto City Toga School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;南砺市立利賀学舎&lt;/span&gt;. At the time, there were only 10 junior high students (among 3 grades) and 13 elementary students (among 6 grades). The graduating class was only 2 students. There was only one 6th grader and zero 2nd graders. (&lt;a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 400 people live in Toga today and they're mostly elderly people. Not many young people live out here and there's really no reason. There's lots of construction, but those companies set up temporary housing for their workers in summer. Very few of those workers actually live in Toga. Historically, the area has been poor so there's not much value in living here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a full timeline of these events: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/toga-valley-timeline" title="/toga-valley-timeline"&gt;/toga-valley-timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toga Valley Schools, Settlements, and Neighborhoods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Toga Valley begins where the &lt;b&gt;Sho River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;庄川&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Toga River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀川&lt;/span&gt; join at the base of the mountain. Toga Village contains the first 10km along the Sho River, but the majority of the village follows Toga River up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam Lake &lt;span class='ja'&gt;水無ダム湖&lt;/span&gt;. There's also the initial 20km stretch of &lt;b&gt;Momose River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川&lt;/span&gt; in the east that runs mostly parallel with the Toga River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I went to the area 4 times and visited 14 of the old schools and settlements of Toga Valley. Let's look at each of the areas of Toga Valley in order from the base of the moutain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shogawa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;庄川&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shogawa is the first area at the base of the mountain, and its the first cluster of homes visited after leaving the flat lands of Nanto and Tonami. There was a branch school in this neighborhood, but it no longer exists today, and I can't seem to find any traces of it. I'm not sure when it was initially built, but it was probably in the 30s. It was used for Toga Junior High School from 1949 to 1962, and there's photo of it in the Anniversary book. (Also in 1952, the 4 villages north of Toga Village were collected together to form Shogawa Town, which isn't the same and makes searching more annoying.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still several homes and businesses in Shogawa today including the Komaki Dam. 1.5km up river from Komaki Dam is where Sho River and Toga River join. From Komaki Dam, if you're on the west bank, you'll continue up the Sho River. If you're on the east bank, you'll follow Toga River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shimobara &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下原&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Sho River, the first major neighborhood is Shimoboara. Shimobara's branch school first opened in 1935 as &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校栃原分校下原冬季分校&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Toga Elementary Tochihara Branch School Shimobara Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt;. It was a branch school of another branch school. Later in 1976 when Tochihara Branch School was closed, it become a full branch school as &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校下原分校&lt;/span&gt;. It closed in 1986. It was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 2&lt;/b&gt; remote school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People still live in Shimobara today, although there are only 4 or 5 houses. The branch school used to be in the center, but it was demolished in the last 2 years because of asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/shimobara-winter-branch-school" title="/shimobara-winter-branch-school"&gt;/shimobara-winter-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tochihara &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栃原&lt;/span&gt;, Shigekura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;重倉&lt;/span&gt;, Arayama &lt;span class='ja'&gt;新山&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly south of Shimobara is Tochihara, which was the central area because of the space. Tochihara had open areas along the valley which was perfect for farming. &lt;b&gt;Tochihara Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栃原分校&lt;/span&gt; was one of the first branch schools, built in 1902. Most people moved away by 1973, and the area became uninhabited in 1976, although the farms still remained and there was now a Ski resort, too. The branch school was officially closed the same year. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Tochihara.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Tochihara.html"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few kilometers further down Sho River were the final settlements before Taira Village. Shigekura probably shouldn't even be mentioned as it was only one household and the people moved away in 1906 (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Shigekura.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Shigekura.html"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;). Arayama had 5 households at its peak in 1889. In 1934, an avalance killed all 5 men living there. Two of the families moved away, and eventually in 1955, the remaining households were abandoned. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Arayama.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Arayama.html"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kitabara &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北原&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's one more area on Sho River and that's on the opposite side of the river from Shimobara and Tochihara. These days, it is known as Kitahara, but it's original name was Kitabara. There was enough room along the cliffs of the east bank for farms, so naturally another settlement was formed. &lt;b&gt;Kitabara Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校北原分校&lt;/span&gt; was one of the first to open in 1902 and it continued to be used through 1971. It was completely closed in 1986 with Shimobara. It was also a &lt;b&gt;Grade 2&lt;/b&gt; remote school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are some houses still there and several inns. The branch school has long been demolished. Apparently it was located near the inn called Toga Guest House &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀之家&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=400" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=400"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;). I might try to spend a night there in the future, as its only 7500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a huge bueatiful bridge connecting Kitahara to the west bank. It's part of a tunnel construction project which is still in progress. When complete, the tunnel will go straight through the mountain to Toga Village's center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/kitahara-and-tochihara" title="/kitahara-and-tochihara"&gt;/kitahara-and-tochihara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sennohara &lt;span class='ja'&gt;仙野原&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going from Shogawa on the east side of Komaki Dam, the path will follow the east bank of Sho River, and then follow Toga River. Up the cliff a little bit, you'll find a fork in the road. This small path will travel down to the river's edge and use a bridge to cross. On this slim area of land on the opposite side of the mountain of Kitabara is Sennohara. 9 households were here, so the &lt;b&gt;Sennohara Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;仙野原分校&lt;/span&gt; was built in 1902. It was also a &lt;b&gt;Grade 2&lt;/b&gt; remote school. However, by 1966, the area became abandoned. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Sennohara.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Sennohara.html"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1935, the branch school was demoted to only a winter branch school of Kitabara's branch school &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校北原分校の仙野原冬季分校&lt;/span&gt;. Today, the only thing of note in the area is the Jizo Statue Hall on the side of the road marking the entrance path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kurito &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栗当&lt;/span&gt; and Wakidani &lt;span class='ja'&gt;脇谷&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further up the main path about 1.5km toward Toga Village center were the tiny settlements of Kurito and Wakidani, which Murakami considers as the same village. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Kurito.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Kurito.html"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Wakidani.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Wakidani.html"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;) Today, there are a few houses next to the road which are empty, but I didn't not take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, there was &lt;b&gt;Kurito Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校高沼分校栗当冬季分校&lt;/span&gt;, which was part of Takanuma's Branch School. It opened in 1934 and closed in 1967 as &lt;b&gt;Grade 2&lt;/b&gt; remote school. Kurito became uninhabited in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takanuma &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高沼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing along the main route another 2.5km, we reach the first significant neighborhood, Takanuma. It's branch school opened in 1902 along with the other 3 branch schools in Sennohara, Kitabara, and Tochihara. &lt;b&gt;Takanuma Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校高沼分校&lt;/span&gt; continued to operate through 1978 and was officially closed in 1996. (&lt;b&gt;Grade 2&lt;/b&gt; remote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original building is long gone, but the concrete branch school built in the 60s is still there. I was able to go inside and take many photos. It seemed like people who still lived in the area used it as a community building but that was decades ago. Around 2016, the last resident of Takanuma moved away (or died). In Google Street View history, you can see some of the homes that have now been demolished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/takanuma-branch-school" title="/takanuma-branch-school"&gt;/takanuma-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sorei &lt;span class='ja'&gt;草嶺&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing another 3km towards Toga Village is the now abandoned settlement of Sorei. Sorei became abandoned some time in the late 1990s. At its height, there were 17 households with 135 residents in 1947. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Sorei.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Sorei.html"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;) Today, it is completely overgrown, but there are some signs that people have tried to protect the area's shrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2344.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2344_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2344_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2344_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Sorei Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt; of Takanuma Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校高沼分校草嶺冬季分校&lt;/span&gt; was built in 1935 and was closed in 1977. It's remaining students then went to Takanuma Branch School before that was closed a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/abandoned-sorei-settlement" title="/abandoned-sorei-settlement"&gt;/abandoned-sorei-settlement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshiba &lt;span class='ja'&gt;押場&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving up another 3km is the Oshiba settlement, which seemed to follow a similar history as Sorei. At its peak in 1947, there were 10 households with 93 residents, each of which steadily moved away eventually leaving the area abandoned in the late 1990s. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the area has been bulldozed by a construction company. The Shinmei Shrine is the only thing that remains of the original village. The &lt;b&gt;Oshiba Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校北豆谷分校押場冬季分校&lt;/span&gt; opened in 1930 and closed in 1968. It was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 2&lt;/b&gt; remote school, and it was a winter branch of our next school, Kitamamedani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/abandoned-oshiba-settlement" title="/abandoned-oshiba-settlement"&gt;/abandoned-oshiba-settlement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kitamamedani &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北豆谷&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a kilometer away is the neighborhood of Kitamamedani which is still populated today. It's also the first area we've reached that has an active Post Office branch. There are over a dozen homes, and when I visited, some people were outside working on a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could not find any information about when the &lt;b&gt;Kitamamedani Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校北豆谷分校&lt;/span&gt; opened, but I could find that it closed in 1968 along with Oshiba Winter Branch School. I'm sure the area still had students at this time. I think the reason it closed was because the center of Toga Village was only another 2.5km away and the main road was probably safe enough to bus children to school each day. I think this was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 1&lt;/b&gt; remote school given its closeness to the main school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the most striking of schools I had visited yet with its space age spherical windows in its main staircase, and attached gymnasium. After the school closed, it was still used for the neighborhood's yearly Sports festival. The gymnasium was remodeled as a community hall with a full tatami mat floor. Looking inside, it looked like it was being regularly used through 2003. That was one year before the municipal mergers, so maybe their community banquets moved to Toga Village center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/kitamamedani-branch-school" title="/kitamamedani-branch-school"&gt;/kitamamedani-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toga Village Center &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀村&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have now traveled 17km from Komaki Dam to the center of Toga Village. Most of the people who still live in Toga Valley live here and in Sakagami further up the road. There is one governmental building in the middle of town which is the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1523.webp"&gt;Nanto City Toga Village Branch Office&lt;/a&gt;. Inside are the city offices, the post office, and the bank. The building also doubles as a Road Side Stop &lt;span class='ja'&gt;道の駅&lt;/span&gt;, so there's also a store and restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1527.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1527_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up the hill is the turn off for Toga School. As mentioned before, this was built in 1998 as &lt;b&gt;Toga All Person's School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀アーパス&lt;/span&gt; which housed both Toga Elementary and Junior High School. In 2024, both schools combined into a single school simply called &lt;b&gt;Toga School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀学舎&lt;/span&gt;. In 2024, there were only 10 junior high and 13 elementary students for this huge building. It's a difficult trek up the hill, so all students take the bus to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After World War II and the enactment of the new educational orders, &lt;b&gt;Toga Junior High School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀中学校&lt;/span&gt; became the pride of Toga Valley. It's original location was not here, but 500 meters south of the branch office. It was opened in 1947 and remodeled in 1962 with a full dormatory. From 1962, nearly all junior high students lived at school (especially in winter) in order to completely centralize secondary education. Over the years, as more and more roads were built only the most distant students had to live at school. By the 1980s, I don't think the dorms were used. There were only 9 graduates in 1983, anyways. (&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5778.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5778.webp"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through Google Maps, it seems like the building was demolished between 2018 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toga Elementary &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Toga Junior High was rebuilt in 1962, construction for a new Toga Elementary was already underway. Toga Elementary's concrete building was completely in 1963, and this building still stands today. According to Google, it's been used as Toga Dam's office building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1516.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1516.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1516_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1516_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1516_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this was the original site of Toga Public School back in 1892. I don't have any photos of the original wooden building. The concrete building, though, is located between the branch office and the site of the old junior high. It sits next to several homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sakagami Elementary &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上小学校&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toga Elementary was not Toga Valley's only full-fledged elementary school. The neighborhood of Sakagami which was 4 to 5 kilometers up Toga River had just as many homes. Sakagami neighborhood was also very flat, so it provided lots of space for farming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure when the first branch school opened in Sakagami, but it was probably back in the 20s or 30s. With the new elementary and junior high buildings built in the center of town in the early 60s, the Sakagami Branch School was upgraded to a full elementary school in 1968 with a new building. This was &lt;b&gt;Sakagami Elementary School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上小学校&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1700.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1700.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting Toga Elementary was probably a good idea because there were so many branch schools and winter branch schools. Now, all of the southern branch schools (the ones further up the mountain from here) in Toga could operate from Sakagami Elementary. The grduating class of Toga JHS in 1964 was 79 students, so each class in Sakagami ES probably had around 30 students each. (&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5773.webp"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;) Sakagami Elementary was later closed in 1996 along with all branch schools that hadn't been closed already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Sakagami Elementary School building is Star Forest &lt;span class='ja'&gt;スターフォレスト利賀&lt;/span&gt;. Star Forest is a "guest home" that families and schools can rent. Occupants can use the gym, baths, and kitchens as a service. I went there in June, and there were several families in the building. They were packing up a bunch of mountaineering equipment into a truck getting ready to leave. The website says they aren't taking reservations, so maybe its only open in summer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sakagami Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上分校&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Sakagami Elementary, students in the Sakagami neighborhood were taught in the &lt;b&gt;Sakagami Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上分校&lt;/span&gt;. The branch school is 1km further up Toga River from Sakagami Elementary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1505.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1505.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1505_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1505_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1505_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm not sure when it opened. It was probably in the 20s or 30s. It was used by both elementary and junior high school students until 1962 when the junior high dorm was built. It was closed in 1968 when Sakagami Elementary School opened down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went inside the building and looked around. Apparently it was used as a textile sweetshop for women's undergarments in the 70s and 80s. The most recent item I found inside was a calendar from 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/sakagami-branch-school" title="/sakagami-branch-school"&gt;/sakagami-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tanoshima &lt;span class='ja'&gt;田ノ島&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We move past normal signs of civilization another 3km up Toga River to the old settlement of Tanoshima. &lt;b&gt;Tanoshima Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校大勘場分校田ノ島冬季分校&lt;/span&gt; opened in 1935 as a branch school of Okutaikanba. By 1960, it was used by 16 students. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Tanoshima.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Tanoshima.html"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;) This was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 3&lt;/b&gt; remote school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The branch school closed in 1965 when the roads were good enough for students to attend Okutaikanba all year round. By 1978, the final resident moved away leaving the area vacant, although one of the buildings was still as project space for a junior college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the only original building that remains is the Shinmei shrine. Sometime between 2019 and 2021, all buildings were removed and a French restaurant called &lt;a href="https://levo.toyama.jp/restaurant/" title="https://levo.toyama.jp/restaurant/"&gt;Levo&lt;/a&gt; was built. Levo acts as both a restaurant and a lodge, but prices are 31000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; per person at the restaurant. I have no idea who this restaurant is for. Looking from the outside, it reminds me of the restaurant from The Menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine" title="/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine"&gt;/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nakaguchi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;中口&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving 1km up Toga River brings us to the small settlement of Nakaguchi. &lt;b&gt;Nagaguchi Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;中口冬季分校&lt;/span&gt; was opened here in 1953, and closed in 1965 with the Tanoshima school. It was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 3&lt;/b&gt; remote school. Apparently the school operated out of one of the resident's homes. (&lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=133" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=133"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heyaneko visited there in 2010 and there was still a house with someone working on the roof. Although, the area became officially uninhabited in 1992. Looking at Google Maps, that home is no longer there. It was demolished (or collapsed) sometime between 2019 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Okutaikanba &lt;span class='ja'&gt;奥大勘場&lt;/span&gt; / Senzoku &lt;span class='ja'&gt;千束&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving another 1km up Toga River is the neighborhood of Okutaikanba, which has several homes and Senzoku Dam. After Sakagami, this was the most central area of the southern settlements, so they built a full branch schoool here, &lt;b&gt;Okutaikanba Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;奥大勘場分校&lt;/span&gt; in 1935. In 1949, classes were established for junior high school students, too, and by 1959, there were 54 students. This was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 3&lt;/b&gt; remote school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the name was changed to &lt;b&gt;Senzoku Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;千束分校&lt;/span&gt;, which matched the name of the Dam. By 1984, the school was no longer used and it was officially closed in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1274.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1274.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1274_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1274_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1274_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes between 2021 and 2023, the building was demolished. Someone lived in the building in the 2000s, but then a construction company (or the dam offices) used it for housing. It was probably demolished because all these buildings were full of asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/senzoku-branch-school" title="/senzoku-branch-school"&gt;/senzoku-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katsurao &lt;span class='ja'&gt;桂尾&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing up the Toga River past the Toga No. 2 Power Plant was another cluster of homes at 1.5km. This was Katsurao neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1215.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1215_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1215_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1215_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katsurao Winter Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校大勘場分校桂尾冬季分校&lt;/span&gt; was established here in 1944. Much like Nakaguchi's branch school, I think it just operated out of someone's house. It was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 3&lt;/b&gt; remote school, so they got paid well. It was closed in 1965. By 1975, the neighborhood still had 3 homes with 7 residents. (&lt;a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;) But today, there is no one. Two buildings still stand, but probably not for long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taikanba &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大勘場&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly at the source of the Toga River, another 2km upstream brings us to Taikanba. Finding the history of this school is difficult because its name &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大勘場&lt;/span&gt; is nearly the same as Okutaikanba &lt;span class='ja'&gt;奥大勘場&lt;/span&gt;. I think some of the histories were mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia says that Katsuaro Winter Branch School was a branch of Taikanba not Okutaikanba, so I think the Taikanba was out here in the 30s and 40s. Wikipedia also says the name &lt;b&gt;Taikanba Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大勘場分校&lt;/span&gt; was officially established in 1976 when Okutaikanba changed its name to Senzoku. So, that's inconsistent. It was closed in 1996. The area became uninhabited around 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a &lt;b&gt;Grade 4&lt;/b&gt; branch school, the highest grade yet. It's about 12.5km from Toga Elementary and nearly 30km from Komaki Dam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taikanba Branch School building is still here today and it still has power. I arrived around Noon o'clock and the Noon Chime began to play from the loudspeakers attached to the building, which freaked me out at first. The road behind the school leads into the old village, but all of the homes have now collapsed. Looking through Google, the last two homes only recently collapsed in the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/taikanba-branch-school" title="/taikanba-branch-school"&gt;/taikanba-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mizunashi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;水無&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;500 meters past Taikanba, the road is closed. This is essentially the end, however, further past the closed gate, the road continues for another 10km to Mizunashi Dam &lt;span class='ja'&gt;水無ダム&lt;/span&gt;, which is the source of Toga River. The whole area of mountain and forest is known as Mizunashi, and it also had a small settlement, which was another 5km going east from the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mizunashi Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;水無分校&lt;/span&gt; opened in 1929. It began in someone's house until its own building was constructed. It was used until 1966 and closed in 1967. By 1970, all residents of Mizunashi had moved away. (&lt;a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mizunashi was designated as a &lt;b&gt;Grade 5&lt;/b&gt; remote school, the highest grade, and its easy to see why. It was nearly 30km further up the mountain from Toga Village center, and Toga Village was already 17km into the mountain from normal civilization. Even today, it would take nearly an hour to drive from Mizunashi to Toga Village. Now, it can only be accessed from Hida on the other side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toga River complete&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the base of the mountain at Komaki Dam and traveling over 40km all the way to Mizunashi Dam Lake, there were 14 settlements and villages, each with their own schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sennohara → Kurito / Wakidani → Takanuma → Sorei → Oshiba → Kitamamedani → Toga → Sakagami → Nakaguchi → Okutaikanba / Senzoku → Tanoshima → Katsurao → Taikanba → Mizunashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strings of villages through mountain valleys make sense when there's an eventually destination, like a large city on the other side of the mountain, but Toga Valley doesn't go anywhere. It's final destination is an artificial lake. The whole valley had poor soil and growing conditions, so the people living up here were always poor and occasionally starved to death in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this was just a good area to get away from everyone. There were never any daily travelers (other than their neighbors), so people were able to live by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Momose River &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toga Valley was more than just Toga River (and the little bit on Sho River). Running parallel to Toga River to the east about 1.5 away was &lt;b&gt;Momose River&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川&lt;/span&gt;. Momose River began on the west side of Mt. Kongodou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金剛堂山&lt;/span&gt; and continues around 20km until Yamada Dam, which is near Takanuma. The areas of Momose River didn't have as many people as Toga River, but the area was much flatter providing much better farmland, especially for rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Momosegawa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the neighborhood of Momosegawa. It's the central neighborhood of Momose River and it's directly east of Toga Village about 1km over the mountain. There was a path through the mountains for farmers to travel and sell their crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Momosegawa Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;百瀬川分校&lt;/span&gt; opened sometime in the 20s and 30s. I don't know for sure. It was originally a large wooden building on the east bank of the river. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, this is all that's left of the original wooden building. Looking through Google Maps, every few recent years, it seemed like more and more of the building was removed, and now it's just this house with the side of it covered with a tarp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, the school was upgraded to a concrete building, which was built closer to people's homes. It was used through 1989, then officially closed in 1996. Both old school buildings were used for Sake brewing after their decommission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited Momosegawa Branch School on June 7th. The door was open, so I could go inside and take many photos. I returned two weeks later and it was now fenced in and scheduled for demolition. Construction crews santized and tore it down over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I returned in September, the building was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8128.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8128.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8128_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8128_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8128_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Momosegawa was one of the tentpole branch schools of Toga Valley alongside Takanuma, Okutaikanba, Sakagami, and Shogawa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/momosegawa-branch-school" title="/momosegawa-branch-school"&gt;/momosegawa-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suganuma &lt;span class='ja'&gt;菅沼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving north down the river about 3.5km is where Suganuma neighborhood used to be. In 1955, construction on the Suganuma Dam &lt;span class='ja'&gt;菅沼ダム&lt;/span&gt; began and on its completion in 1958, all homes and lands became submerged and destroyed from the new lake. I could not find any information about there being a school here, but there were 4 households that were now under the lake. (&lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Suganuma.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Suganuma.html"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a monument to the village around the area somewhere according to Murakami. I'll try to find it next time I'm in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kamimomose &lt;span class='ja'&gt;上百瀬&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going the opposite direction from Momosegawa is Kamimomose, and the final neighborhood of Toga Valley. It's about 4km away up river. I know very little about &lt;b&gt;Kamimomose Branch School&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;上百瀬分校&lt;/span&gt;, other than that it was closed in 1991. After it closed, the nearby construction company used it as their office, and used the gymnasium for storage. Sometime between 2021 and 2023, the building was demolished, but the construction kept the gym as a storage shed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After visiting Momosegawa Branch School, I went to Kamimomose and took a bunch of photos. I did notice that Kamimomose Branch School was a branch of Sakagami Elementary School and not a branch of the main school. Sakagami is about 2km west of Sakagami over the mountains, so I guess that was more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article and Photos: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/kamimomose-branch-school" title="/kamimomose-branch-school"&gt;/kamimomose-branch-school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the area of Momosegawa has a lot of camping grounds and recreational areas for retreats. They also have a yearly Photo Rogaining event!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toga Valley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I find the area of Toga Valley fascinating. Its an area that seems like people have always struggled with money, food, and population. Only the areas of Momosegawa seemed fertile enough for large rice production, but there were so many other small pockets along the valley that continued to survive. Again, I'm not really sure why people lived so far up the mountain when there wasn't anything there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most settlements, villages, towns, and cities were built and grew from being on the way to the next big village, town, or city. Or people settled in an area that was abundant in some resource. Maybe the settlers of Toga valley were looking for riches in the mountain, but never found any. Or maybe they just wanted to get away and stay away from the rest of Toyama. Either way, once Japan modernized after World War II, families recognized there was no value and left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the population chart (&lt;a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), Toga Valley had a steady population of around 3000 until its spike and peak in World War II. That spike (4,663 people) is a little misleading as it wasn't natural population growth. During World War II, large Japanese cities were routinely fire bombed by the US, and Toyama City was the most devastated in Japan. The US even used it as practice for Hiroshima and Nagasaki launching 4 "pumpkin bombs" that destroyed 99% of the city on August 1st, 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people moved their families into the mountains to avoid these bombings and this created a population spike in rural Japan. After the war and Japan was rebuilding, there were so many new jobs available in the cities, and neighborhoods were being rebuilt. There was no reason to live in the mountains anymore, and it was probably even sabotage if you stayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the old guard continues to hold their old homes in the mountain valley with seemingly no real hope for the future. Maybe once the tunnel opens it'll bring more people to Toga, and they could focus on more camping and leisure outdoor activities, like mountaineering and river fishing. I don't think Toga will ever fully go away when Toga Valley's nature looks so great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the schools and abandoned villages I visited have been collected into singular posts. They were all linked throughout this post, but they have also been collected at this keyword: &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/keyword/toga" title="/keyword/toga"&gt;keyword/toga&lt;/a&gt;. After researching everything, there are a few more new places I want to visit, and double check on a few old ones, so I expect that keyword to grow a little in the future. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/toga-valley-and-past-schools</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/toga-valley-and-past-schools</link><category/><category/><category>Urban Exploration</category><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Mukodaira Observation Deck 向田平展望台</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Takayama is a beautiful city in the middle of the Japanese Alps. It sits on a long expanse of flat plain lands, which was very lucrative for people back in the day to farm and grow rice. And it became an oasis for people who wanted to get away from war and battles in the low lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Takayama is in the mountains, these flat open lands are wide enough to get much more sun than all the other villages and settlements in the valleys. On average, the temperature is about 5 degrees higher in Takayama in winter making it more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always imagined the shape of Takayama like a dish, flat with curved edges. And you can totally see this idea take shape from the observation deck at Mukodaira at the south end of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homes and neighborhoods creep up to the very edge of the hills and mountains to take maximum advantage of the available space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a large panoramic photo I put together:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From up here, on the south end of town, you have a clear view of Miya River &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宮川&lt;/span&gt; as it snakes its way through town. You can also see Takayama Train Line and Route 41 coming from the same area through the valley to enter in Takayama's south side. You can see some of Takayama's schools, hotels, the southside grocery store, and Takayama's only porn store still in business somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite living here for 13 years, I did not know of this vantage point until I was searching around on Google Maps and noticed it. Getting there is a little tricky, though. In this area of town, there's a small road between the two houses in the bottom photo. Just follow that road up into the mountain. It takes about 10 minutes to reach an area to park. From there, it's a quick 5 minute walk to the observation deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can even see the observation deck in the photo on top of the short mountain. There's nothing else up here, though. There's no shrine or temple. Most mountains have a shrine or marker at the top for a local diety, but here there's nothing. The observation deck feels like an afterthought after plowing through the mountain to make towers for powerlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the base of the mountain, though, is Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine. Some of the shrine members were clearing snow from the walkways and setting up for a bonfire in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a clear day, Mukodaira is a fun quick trip to see the town from a different point of view. It's easy enough to get there that you could even make the trip at night. Maybe I'll do that the next time they plan on having fireworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/mukodaira-observation-deck</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/mukodaira-observation-deck</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Mountains</category><category/><category/><category/></item><item><title>Lego Mini Bonsai Collection</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Lego Bonsai tree is one of my favorite sets of all time, and Lego knows this. After its release in January 2021, it became one of Lego's highest selling boutique sets of all time. It was a watershed moment where so many people were reintroduced to Lego and experienced how brilliant and clever their model design had become in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree"&gt;the bonsai tree&lt;/a&gt; around 2 1/2 years ago, and it has steadily gotten me into buying more Lego sets to complement it. With the bonsai tree's popularity, Lego has continued to release more and more botanical sets. In August 2025, they released a new set of Lego bonsai trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Mini Bonsai Tree Collection. It was released in August 2025 for $65, a $15 increase from the original Bonsai set. This was around 10000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; for me. Ultimately, I try to avoid buying Lego these days because I can buy a lot of other things (toys) for 10000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; that won't just sit on my shelf. I could almost buy two full games for this price!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading into Christmas, Amazon had the set on sale for 6000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; and after building the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy" title="/lego-gameboy"&gt;Lego Gameboy&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to add a little bit more flourish to the display on my shelf. So, I bought it. And then I also bought an LED light kit for it. (I always upsell myself on sets.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designers at Lego continue to impress with these trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They continue to be creative about reusing speciality pieces in new and unique ways. The original bonsai tree used pink frogs for cherry blossom leaves. The new ginko tree uses butterflies recolored light orange for leaves. The pine tree uses recolored green claws as needles. And the wisteria uses a gradient of combined flower pieces for its weeping flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building experience is also amazing. They reused the sloping technique from the original bonsai tree, so the trees stand at an angle. Each limb that branches from the trunk can be rotated and moved to create the exact density of foilage you want. Even though each pot is the same, they can be interchanged on the stands giving you the freedom to create whatever scene you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at the trees from a certain angle, they look quite stunning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as other reviewers have noted, when looking directly from the top, the models aren't so flattering. This is especially the case for the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5641.webp"&gt;black pine tree&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves and needles only form a perimeter on the outside. Inside, there's nothing. It looks bad, but depending on how you display them, it probably doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, with these models complete, I could add them to my Gameboy display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great. :) I wanted to use the mini bonsai trees to add more color variety and density to the display, and they achieved both of those goals. It looks much better and more balanced now. (Although, the bonsai trees don't match the scale.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But! There was still something missing. I bought a light kit for the Gameboy and when the whole scene is illuminated, these new trees don't do anything. All the focus is on the Gameboy. It's the centerpiece so, of course, it should stand out the most. But it shouldn't be the only thing that stands out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I bought a light kit from Lightailing. I like their sets because they use custom LED Lego studs rather than adhesive strips of LEDs or singular LEDs you need to place inside of pieces. LED Lego studs are idiot proof and non-destructive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lights do an excellent job of creating a mood rather than putting a spotlight on themselves. The ginko tree lights look amazing because the yellow glow isn't over powering. The green and purple lights look okay, but they do not complement each other. Too much contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction was a bit annoying. My hands were too dry so I could not get a solid grip on the wires to guide them in the right spots. Also, the lights for each of the trees are connected together, rather than having separate lines. This means that you can't completely separate the trees from each other, and there is very little slack. The ginko tree and the wisteria tree are currently at their max distance apart. They can barely move without pulling the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, they create the scene I was hoping for.

Again, I bought them on sale for 6000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; leading into Christmas, which is about $40. I think they're worth it if you can find them for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the instruction manuals for each of the trees if you want to take a look at piece usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/138Onp3JYaeLmf0kAM5QvharKVCsFwa4M/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/138Onp3JYaeLmf0kAM5QvharKVCsFwa4M/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;gdocs/ Ginko Instructions.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvrpOH2Y_5Wi1RrnhXxmCMgbgJMZTJ__/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvrpOH2Y_5Wi1RrnhXxmCMgbgJMZTJ__/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;gdocs/ Black Pine Instructions.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u6Mtou_09570WxV4FUPkqiScZylIkFD8/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u6Mtou_09570WxV4FUPkqiScZylIkFD8/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;gdocs/ Wisteria Instructions.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/lego-mini-bonsai-collection</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/lego-mini-bonsai-collection</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Media</category><category>Toys</category></item><item><title>Ome Showa Goods Museum 昭和レトロ商品博物館</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I love visiting retro museums in Japan. I think the Showa period of Japan is fun to research and peruse as it contains so many building blocks that have morphed into today's capitolistic society. How were products advertised to people 60 years ago? What sort of products were people buying back then? It's interesting how something so sophisticated and advanced back then is mostly trash and garbage today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Showa Goods Museum &lt;span class='ja'&gt;昭和レトロ商品博物館&lt;/span&gt; in Ome (west west Tokyo) focuses on the commercialism of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. It's not a very big museum, like other retro museums I have visited. There's only one main room, and it was lined with displays cases that focused on different categories of products, such as stationery, toiletries, medicine, cigarettes, coca-cola, games, and sweets. The entrance had display cases with candy, soda, and cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After looking through all of the cases, I think my favorite product was a pair of upscale fancy face masks. I love the design of the man and woman on the cover of the box. In the 50s, this style was probably considered peak fashion. But now the colors have faded, the box is rotted and tore, and the mask looks like its about to fall apart. It's a real metaphor of fashion through the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their replica movie poster paintings were their most prized possessions, though. Or maybe they were restored originals? They had a recent photo that showed a man painting them. (I did not read the fine print.) These posters were incredibly vivid and striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upstairs, they had an exhibition room which focused on the Japanese folk tale, Yuki-Onna &lt;span class='ja'&gt;雪おんな&lt;/span&gt;, literally translated as Snow Woman. There were diorama displays showing each of the key scenes from the tale, various copies of books that reprinted the tale, photos of an author, and some inspired art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all Japanese folktales, including Yuki-Onna, originated hundreds of years ago, so I don't think it really fit with the Showa theme. However, it is one of more popular tales and authors in the early 1900s (before Showa) wrote the modern version of it. Maybe it was super popular in Showa times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry for the Showa Goods Museum was only 350&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;, but you could buy a 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; combination tickets for another museum just down the block, the Showa Gentou-kan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;昭和幻燈館&lt;/span&gt;. Gentou basically means a slide as part of slide projection. The front face of the store sold headshots of many actors and actresses of the 60s and 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main part of Gentou-kan was a showcase all of this cat artwork, and the best part about the displays were the parody Kanban signs. I got photos of all sixteen of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, the shop only had one small piece of merch connected to the signs. It was the Bread Kanban Sign, but they went a step further than the original by changing &lt;span class='ja'&gt;パン&lt;/span&gt; (bread) to &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ニャン&lt;/span&gt; (meow). I probably should've bought it, but I refrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a cute museum, but it seemed far away from everything else. I don't think it'd be worth the trip on its own. But, if you were already in the area, I think the small 350&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; entry fee is an easy sell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/ome-showa-goods-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/ome-showa-goods-museum</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Japan is a country full of pockets within its dense urban centers and rural country. Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日美術館&lt;/span&gt; is such a location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudou Teruhi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日&lt;/span&gt; is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;増富中学校&lt;/span&gt; in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District &lt;span class='ja'&gt;須玉町小尾&lt;/span&gt; part of Hokuto City &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北杜市&lt;/span&gt;. When Masutomi Junior High School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;増富中学校&lt;/span&gt; was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;増富村&lt;/span&gt;. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town &lt;span class='ja'&gt;須玉町&lt;/span&gt; with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日&lt;/span&gt;. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤賢司&lt;/span&gt;, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日&lt;/span&gt;. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Entry was 1000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; and each book was 2000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/kudou-teruhi-art-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/kudou-teruhi-art-museum</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While traveling out of town, I went past the old Takane village, one of the eastern-most villages in Takayama and also one of the most remote. I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/takane" title="/takane"&gt;I visited in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and both buildings were still standing. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane"&gt;I visited again in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and the Junior High had been demolished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp"&gt;the nearby construction sign&lt;/a&gt;, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane-in-2025</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane-in-2025</link><category/><category/><category>Urban Exploration</category><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Wind Castle Shuttered</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Wind Castle in southern Toyama is perched on a short mountain covering the valley entrance to the city. From this vantage point, you could notice anyone coming down the mountain into the city. Likewise from the other direction, you have a full view of Toyama and nearly all its neighborhoods shielded by the surrounding mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first visited the Wind Castle &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle" title="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle"&gt;2 years ago&lt;/a&gt; never even knowing it had been since the 80s or 90s. Although, in reality, it's not really all that easy to see unless you know what you're looking for. The castle tower isn't really that tall and its aluminum shimmer blends into the sky and the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also not all that convenient to get to from Hwy 41 either. You either go further north than is necessary, or you take a narrow windy road straight to it. Once you arrive in Sakurayama Forest Park, it's another 450 steps up the castle trail to the peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty landmark, but it seems like it has been closed for good. Even when visiting 2 years ago, a lot of the paint was chipping away, and molding holding the thick bottled glass tiles was peeling. Now, several of the glass tiles have cracked, broke open, or broke free of their mold. The metal deck also bends under the weight of my steps. It doesn't really feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure where this extra damage came from. There were some tiles missing before, but everything still seemed safe. Perhaps the New Years earthquake of 2024 knocked a lot more of this stuff loose. There's not a lot of money to go around these days, so the city probably thought it was easier to shutter the attraction, rather than pour money into the necessary renovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, Toyama would illuminate the castle in the evening, and the controls for the illumination were inside the room on the observation deck. The leading doors were locked, but the door on the farther side had been pulled open. The wooden edge of the door has disintergrated, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle-shuttered" title="/wind-castle-shuttered"&gt;pulling itself away from the hinges&lt;/a&gt;. Another door had already been boarded shut, probably having suffered the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside was a phone, speaker amplifier, and a bunch of dials and do-dads. There were also instructions for the illumination, but I didn't look through them much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Wind Castle's best attraction is the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's the valley to the south, the city to the north, and the Tateyama mountains to the east. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had always seen these beautiful photos of the city with towering mountains in the background, but I've never been able to see them myself with such clarity. The weather always seems to change a bit in the mountains obscuring them from view. I had a rare opportunity to take some photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also true on my way to the Wind Castle coming from the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am curious about the future plans for the Wind Castle. No one is putting money into any public attractions these days, especially in rural areas. I would imagine most of that money is going into infrastrcture, repairing roads and making new tunnels. I doubt it'll ever be repaired. Also, removing it might be costly, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We shall see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/wind-castle-shuttered</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/wind-castle-shuttered</link><category/><category/><category>Urban Exploration</category><category>Castles</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Himi Showa Hall</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Himi Showa Hall is a collection of items, tools, and daily things from the Showa Period of Japan, roughly 1926 to 1989. This period saw Japan's worst as they allied with Germany in World War II, and saw some of Japan's best as the country revitalized itself after and became one of the world's leaders in electronics in the 80s going into the 90s. Japan's aging population has fond memories of the Showa period and it is a geat example of Japan's potential in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several retro museums dotted across Japan that celebrate this period, generally titled Showa Hall. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2" title="/showa-hall-2"&gt;The Showa Hall in Takayama&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite touristy places where I live, and it's fun to see the building blocks connecting today's modern society to Japan's more pocketed past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Himi Showa Hall is a collection of stuff run by just one guy and his wife.

This goes in line with the NES replica released a few years ago, and a few other attempts at nostalic video game replicas, like the Atari 2600 and the Pac-man Arcade unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was initially turned off by this announcement. I don't have a lot of nostalgia for the original Gameboy. And, while building Lego models is always fun, these larger models are expensive, take up space, and in this case, it doesn't really match the other Lego models on my shelf. It's a 60$ shelf piece, and that money would be better spent on actual video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price on the set came down leading into Black Friday. It actually does kinda fit with my botanical decour since it is another life-sized model. And Natalie the Nerd announced that she was making a conversion kit to turn the Lego model into an actual working Gameboy. Because of the Analogue Pocket, I don't need a working Gameboy, but the idea of putting it together sounds really interesting. I want to try it, even though it will be expensive and I'll never use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I bought the model. And I bought a light kit, going further away from my excuse of the cost. I also bought a few other things to make another modification on the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Build&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the Lego Gameboy is an incredible experience. So many of the components fit together sideways, backwards, and upside-down to create enough space inside the model for the buttons and D-pad to work, as well as match the near exact dimension of a real Gameboy. Various blocks also represent the PCB and other electrical internal components covered by the outer shell in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much care is put into the building experience. I think its easy to look at a Lego model and judge it based on its appearance, but there is often so much more to a Lego model. Putting it together can often show how much care the designer took in their planning and understanding of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, being able to hold the Lego Gameboy, touch the buttons, and play with it adds so much to the model. It's not as heavy as the original, and the studs on the D-pad are terrible, but after an incredible building experience, it feels like you've created something complete and workable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being to go a step further in the future to make it actually workable will bring further life to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does its best to match the dimensions and size of the original Gameboy, it still looks like Lego in the end from all the seams. Unfortunately, there's no real way to fix any of this. And really, the design team already did their best to hide as many seams as possible. This set includes several new pieces and new colored pieces to make it as lifelike as possible. If you think they should have done more, may as well just buy a replacement shell at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Buttons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the new colored pieces were used for the buttons. It is a mini-figure hat element recolored in magenta. Since I've been doing a bunch of console modding recently, I wanted to try the buttons in different colors, and there's only one other color available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Kingsley Shacklebolt from Series 2 of the Harry Potter mini-figure series. Perhaps, it is an unremarkable figure of someone I have never heard of. Was he in the main series? Or Fantastic Beasts? Anyways, the Lego Gameboy buttons are a recolored version of his hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took apart the model a little bit, and installed the blue buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks okay. They feel and operate much smoother than the magenta buttons for some reason, but the look is off. As much as I wanted to make my Lego Gameboy unique, the colors make it look like a knockoff. It kinda looks like a Watara Supervision. So, I put the magenta buttons back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Lego is being able to customize your builds however you like. Unfortunately, because so many of these pieces are unique and have unique prints on them, this is really the best you can do. You could also change the D-pad to a different color and use black start and select buttons, but I don't think any of those would improve the model. If they release a cross piece without studs, that would be an excellent upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because playing around with the buttons felt way better, when Natalie releases her conversion kit, I may end up using one or both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aliexpress had a Lego Gameboy light kit for $3! Although that price was for new members only. The actual price ended up being 1700&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. A bit expensive for a few LEDs, but I thought that I could use the light later with Natalie's LCD screen. (probably not)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kit came with some Legos to modify the stands and a few raw LEDs. It also came with no instructions. You are meant to go to YouTube and watch a video of someone putting it together. &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g" title="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g"&gt;This is the video.&lt;/a&gt; It is often difficult to see exactly what it going on because of the black pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing the screen LED is easy, though. You just open up a path along the back and stick the LED strip along the base of the screen behind the inlay. You replace the holding bar with a small pipe piece which I think holds the inlay in place much better anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can barely see the pipe's shadow in the upper right corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen LED was the whole reason I bought the kit, but I decided to put together the stand LED lights, too. Unfortunately, these tiny LEDs are very brittle. I was able to install two of them easily, but &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.webp"&gt;I destroyed one of them&lt;/a&gt; crimping the piece the wrong way. With a very tiny pair of wire strippers, this could be fixed, but I will ignore it for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two out of three lights still allows me to create the modifications to the Gameboy's stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this light kit looks exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lego Gameboy is meant as a display piece so it makes sense to have museum style spotlights on it. The screen LED also has a consistent level orange tone that makes it look like a classic screen light, too. Either Mario and Zelda inlays look great with this mod, but I prefer Zelda. The standard Nintendo scroll doesn't look like great, in my opinion. Tetris would've been best, but getting that license would've been more difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going further, I used some leftover Lego LEDs from my bonsai trees and connected all the USB plugs together to set the Lego Gameboy among my Lego botanical collection. It works as the perfect center piece and the lights really emphasize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should get some more Lego spotlights for the rest of the scene. (No no, stop spending money.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incredible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I'm very adverse to buying more Legos because of the price, the Lego Gameboy exceeds all of my expectations. I felt such incredible joy and accomplishment putting together the model, even though it's ultimately just a display piece (for now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Lego, 60$ really isn't all that much compared to so many other overpriced sets. Even the new Japanese Bonsai sets are way too expensive. However, considering that I could spend that same 60$ (or less) on Death Stranding 2, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Ghosts of Yotei, it seems so foolish to buy this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I think its an incredible model that was a joy to build, looks authentic, and could become more special in the future thanks to Natalie the Nerd. If you're into video game collectibles, especially Nintendo, I think it's worth a purchase even if you don't care too much about the Gameboy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category>Toys</category><category>Media</category></item><item><title>Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining event returns this year with a new theme, The Story of Trees through the Ages. &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;時代（とき）をめぐる木と樹の物語&lt;/span&gt; is the full title of the event. Last year's theme focused on Kanamori Nagachika and various locations that were impacted by him. This year, the focus was on trees!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several millenia old trees in Takayama, but Takayama also has a rich history in carpentry and craftsmanship in wood arts. After the area was taken over by Kanamori in the late 1500s, he recognized the unique carpentry skills of the residents and cultivated their ability. Many of the resulting woodwork would be used for buildings throughout Gifu, Nagoya, and Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like last year, the event was hosted at the Takayama City Museum and also just like last year, it was advertised very little. I think the posters at the entrance of the museum were the only indication it was happening. Once again, I didn't hear about it until a local friend sent me a message. Here's the link for information: &lt;a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/"&gt;https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my third photo rogaining event. I joined &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="/takayama-photo-rogaining"&gt;last year's Takayama Rogaining event&lt;/a&gt; as my first. Prior, I had never heard of this kind of event before. The etymology of Rogaining comes from the three people who coined the term, Roy, Gail, and Neil, and they first began using the term in the 70s. However, Photo Rogaining isn't all that different from Orienteering which dates back to 1897.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it's like a marathon, but you create your own path. 20 or 30 minutes prior to the start of the race, runners or teams of runners are given a map and a list of checkpoints. Runners have no knowledge of this leading up to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here were the map and list of checkpoints for this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each checkpoint has a different point value. For each checkpoint you visit, that point value is added to your total. The team or runner with the highest point value wins. Photo Rogaining goes one step further by requiring runner to take photos of the target at each checkpoint. You are meant to recreate the photos listed on the checkpoint sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Orienteering or Rogaining event has a strict time limit, so you must reach the finish line within the time limit while collecting as many checkpoints as possible. The Takayama Photo Rogaining event has a limit of 3 hours. You are deducted 30 points each minute you are late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus (or headache), the Takayama Rogaining event adds some extra bonus points. Last year, you could gain an extra bonus point for every photo you took of Kanamori Nagachika's name written out on a sign for a total of 20 bonus points. I didn't quite understand this last year, so I ignored it. Ultimately I lost 2nd place by 4 points. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's bonus points were much more cryptic and numerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1 were the normal &lt;span class='ja'&gt;通常&lt;/span&gt; bonus points. At four of the checkpoints (numbers 1, 17, 25, 47), if you took an additional photo matching the ones posted, you could get an extra 5 points each. This was very clear and easy to understand. Find the stuff, and take a photo. Got it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2 were the secret &lt;span class='ja'&gt;秘密&lt;/span&gt; bonus points. There were 3 different collections of locations that each followed the theme posted on the board. If you went to each of the locations that matched the theme, you would be awarded either 40 or 30 bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three themes were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Theme 3 - 40 points - 1000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時を見てきた長生きの木&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme 2 - 30 points - 400&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時をつなぐ&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class='ja'&gt;人の飛騨の匠&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme 1 - 30 points - 100&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a glance, I just noticed 1000-year-old trees, 400-year-old takumi, and 100-year-old carpenters. At the time, I thought, Yeah, I could correctly translate these to understand them completely. However, I would have no idea which locations would match these descriptions. So, I choose to not focus on them and hope my path would collect these locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the time came, we were able to open our maps and start plotting our courses. Having done these events twice now, I have learned that you want to make big swings towards the distant areas first, and clean up the points near the finish at the end. If you spend too much time getting all the near points at the beginning, you may not have enough time to get the high valued places further out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's far out locations were nearly the same as last year's. So my plan was to grab a few near checkpoints while heading further west to Hida no Sato and the Shingu neighborhood. From Shingu, head directly north to the Kumano Shrine, which &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter" title="/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter"&gt;I visited back in February&lt;/a&gt;. And then head back downtown to grab any more points I could before the finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan was also to not get any checkpoints that required backtracking unless I had the time for it and they were high value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Noon, the bell was rung and the museum bay doors were open allowing everyone to spill out into the street and start running in their directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately went to the 3 checkpoints clustered together at Nakabashi. First was point 3, the Sakura tree next to the bridge, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山市基準木のサクラ&lt;/span&gt;. On the other side of the bridge was point 6, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;木鶴大明神像&lt;/span&gt;, the statue of Mokkaku Daimei.

Point 6 required a little backtracking, but no more than a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued south along the river to get Point 7, a Sugi tree in front of a shrine, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山神明神社のスギ&lt;/span&gt;. From Point 7, I had two options: go south for Point 16 or go west to Points 10 and 14. 24 is greater than 16 and it was the quicker path for further going west. My plan was to go for the big swings rather than clean up every checkpoint. (Ultimately, this was a mistake.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found Point 10, another shrine's sugi tree, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;一本杉白山神社の先立スギ&lt;/span&gt; and then Point 14, a small ume tree next to another shrine, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨天満宮のウメ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 → 10 → 14 // (+31 points / 45 total) // 12:16pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I was doing pretty good so far. That's quite a few points in a short time. Although, these events are marathons. It doesn't matter how fast you can grab points if you run out of energy. You need to keep going and continue grabbing more and more points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hida Sangyo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨産業&lt;/span&gt; (Point 17) was right next to Tenman Shrine (Point 14), so I quickly grabbed that photo. Point 17 was my first checkpoint with a bonus point. I needed to run inside and find the set of chairs. I thought they would be right by the entrance, but they were not. I ran through the ground floor and found nothing. After asking the receptionist, the photo was located in the back area on the second floor.

This is where actually training for the event would've been helpful. Run, walk, run, walk. If I would've done a lot more running, I could've covered the distance much faster, which would've helped in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 23, 24, 25 were all next to each other, and Point 25 had a bonus point. I first grabbed a photo of Point 23, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;友好の丘&lt;/span&gt;, the hill of friendship. Then went off the main road to Point 24, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;旧野首家&lt;/span&gt;, the former Nokubi house. On the hill behind the house was a small museum of mountain tools, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山岳資料館&lt;/span&gt;, Point 25. And, just inside the door, was the ice pick for 5 bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 → 24 → 25 → 5 bonus // (+77 points / 144 total) // 12:39pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was slowing down, but I thought that I was still on a good pace, despite the time wasted at Hida Sangyo. Point 28 was nearby, but continuing up the hill to grab Points 26 and 27 were more lucrative. I thought that backtracking to Point 28 after would cost too much time. (Ultimately, this skip was fine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point 26 was an easy find being next to the road. It was the entrance to another wooden furniture showroom, the Hida Mokuyuu-kan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨木遊館&lt;/span&gt;.  Point 27 was much more difficult to locate. It was one of seven 5 meter wooden statues in the "forest of good fortune," &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨開運乃森&lt;/span&gt;. I had never seen this place before, so I climbed in the backway, not realizing I was looking for the statue in front of the entrance. Another 5 minutes wasted and some energy wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 → 27 // (+53 points / 197 total) // 12:52pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next plan was to head further west and grab all the Shingu points. There were 3 locations worth 40 points each!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still able to keep moving and keep pace with time, but I was doing more walking than running. I started eating some of the chocolates we were given at the start. I also drank all of my water. I made a quick pick stop at Lawson to get another water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it to Point 40 labeled as "a large tree near Harayama park" &lt;span class='ja'&gt;原山公園近くの大樹&lt;/span&gt; in 20 minutes. It wasn't hard to find, but I was slowing down. I went north from the tree to visit two craftsmanship workshops, Point 41 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小坂彫房&lt;/span&gt; Kosaka Woodcrafts and Point 42 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;川上憲一氏工房&lt;/span&gt; Kawakami Woodworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both woodworking locations were a little awkward as the photos meant encrouching into their businesses. You stood in front of the main window of Kosaka Woodcrafts and took photos while they worked. At Kawakami, there was a guy waiting for you. He escorted me into the workshop to take the photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;40 → 41 → 42 // (+123 points / 320 total) // 1:23pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, my main goal was to grab the northwestern-most points at Kumano shrine. Point 43 was nearby, but I was worried about time. The race was about half complete, and I assumed that it would take me an hour to go from Kumano Shrine to the finish. I wasn't even sure I could get all those points in 30 minutes. I decided that it required too much backtracking for the points to be worth it. (Ultimately, this wasn't that big a mistake, but it was still 43 points.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept pushing forward to Kumano Shrine, even though my legs were starting to hit their limit. I went past my school and the surrounding businesses. I went across the bridge and cut across the rice fields. And I arrived at Point 55, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;熊野神社のスギ&lt;/span&gt;, the Sugi trees at the entrance of Kumano Shrine, at 1:47pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Mr. Shimizu (who won first place last year, and this year too) arrived. From there, the next point was 47, the ancient hut at Akahogi Park &lt;span class='ja'&gt;風土記の丘&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;復元住居広場&lt;/span&gt;. Shimizu used the windy clear paths going up the hill to the park, but I terminatored my way through brush and thicket taking the straightest path to the hut. We arrived at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having visited the hut earlier in the year, I knew exactly where the bonus point was. I went inside and snapped the photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 → 47 → 5 bonus → 46 // (+153 points / 473 total) // 1:54pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to keep pace with Shimizu as we both got Point 46 at the same time heading back down the hill. Point 46 was a pile of charcoal and firewood &lt;span class='ja'&gt;活エネの炭焼き窯と薪&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, after that, my legs were done. This was the end of my big swings, and now I had to get back to the finish line before 3pm. I had one hour which was totally doable under nomal situations. Shimizu said he was running off to Sky Park, but there was no way I could get there. I kept moving quickly, but all of my remaining points would be small deviations from my straight path to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map, I decided to head towards Takayama Station to grab Point 13 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山駅連絡通路の&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;屋台展示&lt;/span&gt;. There was a replica wooden festival float inside. I still had some time, so I went a little north to get a photo of the 1000 year old ginko tree at Kokubunji, Point 11 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;騨国分寺の大イチョウ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 → 11 // (+24 points / 497 total) // 2:36pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, I saw some teams run north to grab Points 9 and 8. These points felt undoable in my situation, and I wanted to get closer to the finish line. So, I ignored them. (Ultimately, this was a big mistake.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went west to the finish line, and arrived with 15 minutes left. I quickly moved up the hill and got Point 2 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ミネルヴァのフクロウ&lt;/span&gt;, the wooden owl in front of the library. Then with my final push, I grabbed Point 1 at the finish line, the Yajima Storehouse &lt;span class='ja'&gt;矢嶋家塩蔵&lt;/span&gt;. Then I wasted time trying to find the bonus point, which was right inside the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 → 1 → 5 bonus // (+8 points / 505 total) // 2:56pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having got that final bonus point, I went across the finish line and completed the race in 2 hours 57 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I had done pretty well. I visited more locations compared with last year. My point total was lower, but the maximum point total was also lower. On average, my score was higher than last year! However, the bonus points killed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there were three themes, and now I actually translated them:&lt;br/&gt;Theme 3 - 40 points - &lt;b&gt;1000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時を見てきた長生きの木&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (1000-year-old trees)&lt;br/&gt;Theme 2 - 30 points - &lt;b&gt;400&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時をつなぐ&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class='ja'&gt;人の飛騨の匠&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (400-year-old Hida carpenters)&lt;br/&gt;Theme 1 - 30 points - &lt;b&gt;100&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(100-year-old Hida Businesses supporting area carpenters.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now at the end, these locations had been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 10, 11, and 16 contained the 1000-year-old trees. Very early in the race, I intentionally skipped Point 16 because I thought it was too far out of the way. Given everywhere else I went, this was a 56-point loss. Although, I may have skipped Point 10 if I went to 16 instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 8, 9, 41, 42 were the 400-year-old carpenters. I made the big swing to grab Points 41 and 42, but with so little energy left at the end and not so much time, I did not go the extra distance out of my way to get Points 8 and 9. If I had known these would've boosted my score an extra 30 points, I would've skipped Takayama Station and the Library. This was basically a 34-point loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 17, 28, 49 were the 100-year-old companies. This one was a wash anyways. I had only gotten Point 17. I could've done a little backtracking for Point 28 near Hida-no-Sato. But I had never considered going after Point 49. It was too far north. Technically, no real point loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had I actually done training for the event and had better knowledge of these bonus points, my score could've easily been more than 100 points higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shimizu got first place again this year by visiting nearly all checkpoints on the map. He only skipped four points. He skipped Point 49, which was too far north, losing him 30 bonus points. He also missed a 5-point bonus photo somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standings were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1st Place - 768 points&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place - 747 points&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - 693 points&lt;br/&gt;4th Place - 603 points&lt;br/&gt;5th Place - 557 points&lt;br/&gt;6th Place - 510 points&lt;br/&gt;7th Place - 505 points &lt;--- It's me!&lt;br/&gt;8th Place - 481 points&lt;br/&gt;9th Place - 423 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I ended at 7th place out of 9 people in my division. Not Last! Also, our division was the most competitive, so my score was pretty close the top places in the group and family divisions. 100 points would have boosted me to 4th place, but I would have absolutely not made the Top 3 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had a lot of extra prizes, so I was able to win something anyways. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I love running these Photo Rogaining events, but I always feel disappointed in the end. It's like the opposite feeling after completing a marathon. In both cases, poor training can result in poor times, but for Rogaining, there's always the worry of whether or not you are following the optimal path for your ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was only able to do two Rogaining events this year. I signed up for a third, but it was held only two days after this Takayama event. My legs were ruined the whole weekend, so it was impossible for me to join. I spent the rest of the weekend building that Lego Gameboy. (They sent me a map, though, so I could mentally practice.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll try to do more next year! Maybe this time I will have the proper motivation to train for them. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025</link><category/><category/><category>Running</category><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category/></item><item><title>Analogue Pocket Button Replacement</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Analogue Pocket is one of my favorite pieces of video game hardware ever. Decades of video game history have never looked, sounded, and felt better when played on this beautiful device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Analogue Pocket lends itself well to people wanting to customize their gaming experience both inside and outside of the platform. One of the first mods people did with their Pockets was a button swap. After the release of the Pocket and the opening of its FPGA, popularity exploded and many Etsy sellers got to work making their own buttons. I bought two different sets of replacement buttons back in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set was from a seller on eBay who no longer exists. This was recommended by a user on the FPGA discord. The buttons followed the convex concave pattern of an SNES controller, but are made from soft resin. The D-pad is ever so slightly enlarged to prevent wiggling in the Pocket's shell. Because of this, the D-pad and buttons felt so much better than the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second set was from an Etsy store called Cloud Life, which also no longer exists. This store had a lot of different colors available, but I wanted something subtle, yet different. I didn't want any flashy gaudy colors as that would take away from the Pocket's sleek aesthetics. They also accepted custom orders, so I decided to use the Black button set as a base and add two transparent buttons for Y and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting everything in Winter 2023 during a trip back to America, I finally did a button swap using the Cloud Life set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buttons looked really nice, but there were problems in other areas. First, the menu buttons had the wrong grooves. They sent two right buttons, instead of a right and left. Also, the bottom nub on the D-pad was flat, not rounded. This meant that it would usually not register rolling movements on the D-pad. If I pressed down, then right, it would stay down. So, I only did the button replacement, shown above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;NES D-pad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone else on the FPGA discord mentioned something interesting. Apparently the NES D-pad on those Nintendo replica Controller Capsule toys is an exact fit for the Analogue pocket. I bought &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set" title="/nintendo-controller-button-set"&gt;a bunch of these last year&lt;/a&gt; when they released the second series focusing on Super Nintendo, Gamecube, and N64. I didn't care about the NES and Famicom ones, but I wanted to give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Auctions had a cheap enough one. It can easily be taken apart with a Phillips head screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user claimed that this D-pad felt so good when playing games. It also fixed his unfortunate problem of triggering false diagonals, a common problem among some Pocket owners. I never had this problem with my Pocket. My only problem was using that Cloud Life replacement D-pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at each of these D-pad, you can see where these problems could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grey D-pad is a near exact resin mold of the original D-pad. The nub in the middle is rounded, allowing for smooth diagonal movements. The stock D-pad had the same shape. The Cloud Life D-pad on the far right also has this nub, but it is not rounded. This does not allow for smooth diagonal movements, which causes some directions to become locked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NES D-pad looks like the best for rounded movements. It uses a stiff plastic post with a rounded ball in the middle. There are no grooves at all for diagonal movements to get stuck. This is why the NES D-pad felt the better than the stock D-pad for that user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I got to work tearing down my Pocket to install the NES D-pad as its nub's shape was clearly the best out of all my options. There's a great guide on ifixit showing &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396" title="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396"&gt;full teardown and button replacement&lt;/a&gt; that I always refer to when opening my Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main tool you'll need a T6 screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only five screws you'll need to remove. Four of them are immediately on the back panel of the Pocket, which is the first step of the teardown. You remove those screws and the back panel comes loose. This reveals the battery pack. Unplug the battery, and then remove it from the tabs on the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a Gen 1 first release Pocket. Later models have slightly different batteries, but the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going further, we need to remove the PCB for the shoulder button contacts. There's a tiny plastic tab holding it in place. Pull that back with some tweezers and the board should come loose. Next, we want to &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.webp"&gt;remove the ribbon cable&lt;/a&gt;. Just pop open the gate, and the ribbon can be pulled out. (This is annoying to put back in later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the back panel is only clipped into place. To remove it, &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.webp"&gt;slightly lift the bottom end of it&lt;/a&gt;, and then slide it down. The clips will let go of it, and you can remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the back of the Pocket's main PCB. There are four points of contact now. The cables going to the top two speakers must be unplugged. Just open those gates, and pull out the cables. There's another cable going to the power button. Open that gate, and remove the cable. And, the final screw in the middle, which holds the PCB to the front shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCB can be lifted from the shell, but there is still a cable from PCB to the front screen. The ifixit instructions say to remove the plug to completely detach the front shell, but I am too nervous to do this step. It's probably completely safe, but I'm too worried about damage. I can reach the buttons easily without having to unplug it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remove my D-pad and put in the NES D-pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I don't like how it looks. The plastic sheen of the NES D-pad doesn't match the matte finish of the Pocket, nor the softness of the Cloud Life buttons. It looks really out of place. Also, the arrows on the D-pad also don't match the Pocket's aesthetics. It's too busy compared with the subtleness of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main purpose of doing a button replacement is for the presentation. All of the stock components already felt amazing and played great, so I didn't need to do anything if I only cared about usage. Also, the NES D-pad is slightly smaller than the original one. So, it wiggled around even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user on the FPGA discord was using the D-pad on a White Pocket, so the aesthetics are a bit different. On the Black Pocket, it's too easy to compare black to black and see that things are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloud Life D-Pad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the aesthetics of the Cloud Life D-pad the best, but its square nub prevented the movements. Well...  what if I used a nail file to round it out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material they used for these buttons melted away almost immediately, and I could create the rounded movement that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's more square than the original D-pad, but it fits the aesthetics and matches the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material that they used for these buttons is weirdly refractive. Depending on how the light enters the button, the weave of the material either brightens or darkens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this with the X and A buttons on the side. The weave of the X button is horizontal, while the weave of the A button is vertical. With the direction that I installed the D-pad, too much light is reflected. I need to open it up again and change the rotation to make it perfect. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buttons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Pocket-mania has really died down. Developers are still putting out some Arcade cores, but Analogue has been focusing their efforts on their Nintendo 64, and not really given much time to the Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do occasionally play the Pocket from time to time. I'll run through a game of Dr. Mario, and see how far I can get in Gradius III or Outrun. Sometimes I'll devote a little time for a good run in Tetris Rosy Retrospective, too. Maybe someday, I'll try to get all the way through Snatcher on Turbo CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having the boring Black version of the Pocket, I really love how it looks, how it plays, and how it feels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-button-replacement</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-button-replacement</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Juunigatake in Autum 十二ヶ岳</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Over 10 years ago, I hiked Junnigatake and was able to see the entirety of Nyukawa and the surrounding mountains in Takayama. For quite a while, I have wanted to hike the mountain again for some updated photos. I remember it being a really easy hike, so I finally pulled the cord and went back on a beautiful and clear mid-November day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hike was almost exactly the same as it was back when I first arrived in Takayama. Here's &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/juunigatake" title="/juunigatake"&gt;my post from 11 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. After turning from the entrance, the old abandoned bus was still in its same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing both photos, a lot more garbage had been added to it. Looking through the current garbage inside, there were multiple old CRT tvs and an old computer tower with nothing inside. There was lots of old stero equipment and some office chairs. Maybe all this stuff was inside the bus before, and someone had fished it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing up the road, the pavement became dirt and I arrived at the familiar crossroads. Taking a left continued up the mountain, and taking a right continued along the edge of the mountain going to some unknown destination. I wonder if there are any abandoned homes or buildings that way. (Actually, the road probably just ends.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went with left path and ascended reaching a road block after 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few meters down the road, a landslide had covered some of the path. I probably could have driven around or over it, but the real risk is the current part of the road collapsing. According to my notes, the trailhead for the mountain wasn't too far away, so I parked my car and grabbed my camera. I grabbed a bear bell for protection, too. (Although, if a bear showed up, it's not going to care that I have a bell.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail entrance wasn't too far away. It was around just a few bends of the mountain road. On the edge of one of the bends, was a small, yet clear sign indicating the entrance of the trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail left the dirt road and went up into the trees. The trail was completely covered in leaves, but there was a clear break in the trees and twigs which guided me further up and down the side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About halfway up the trail, it became completely covered in overgrown brush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From above, it seemed like there was no organization. Once you entered the brush, each direction looked the same. The brush was about as tall as I was, so I had to crouch walk to keep place with the trail. Even though it felt like I was just plowing through with no direction, the faint spacing of a trail was legitimate, and it lead me to the summit's base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a shrine gate at the base of the summit leading to a steeper ascent, but with stairs this time. The stairs go directly to the summit and observation point. But, there is a less steep option going to the right and circling the summit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the summit, you can see all of Nyukawa, the immediate north-eastern neighborhood of Takayama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although today, I really couldn't see much of anything. The sun was setting directly in my eyes and a lot of water vapor was collecting in the air readying for the rain fall that would happen in the next 2 hours. I took my photos, but even looking at them now, it's hard to exactly pinpoint certain locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My photos from 11 years ago were far clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can actually see Takayama in the above photo from 11 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had much more success with photos going to the east than west. Both Mt. Norikura, Shinhotaka, and Yarigadake were in clear view. And with the sun pointing directly at them, they were clearly lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's so much easier taking photos of a subject with the lights on them rather than the lights on you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that I wasn't able to get great photos of Nyukawa and Takayama from the summit. Maybe I will try again in the winter. It's really not a difficult hike if you can drive most of the way. Also, there might be an easier way to get to the summit than using my path detailed below. There's a side road located at 36°12'03.1"N 137°21'34.6"E that is a much flatter path, and it might be near the same distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a fun quick hike that I could execute after a half-day of work, and I can feel accomplished that I did a minimal amount of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timeline of Hike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:30pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Juunigatake Road Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556"&gt;N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:48pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crossroad to Juunigatake&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444"&gt;N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:56pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Road Closure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723"&gt;36°11'33.6"N 137°23'19.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:07pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trail Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889"&gt;N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:18pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Top of Ascent&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778"&gt;N36° 11' 47.22", E137° 23' 5.56"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:26pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Summit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722"&gt;N36° 11' 49.74", E137° 23' 11.66"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:40pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Eastern Summit &lt;span class='ja'&gt;十二ヶ岳&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;東峰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111"&gt;N36° 11' 48.31", E137° 23' 16.48"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:50pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trail Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889"&gt;N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:57pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Car&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723"&gt;36°11'33.6"N 137°23'19.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3:02pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crossroad to Juunigatake&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444"&gt;N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3:12pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Juunigatake Road Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556"&gt;N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/juunigatake-in-autum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/juunigatake-in-autum</link><category/><category>Mountains</category><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category><category/></item><item><title>8bitdo Pro 3 Controller and Shiny Hunts</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought yet another retro controller. The Pro3 is 8BitDo's latest revision of one of their most popular controller, the SN30, which was based on the Super Nintendo controller. It comes in a few different colors, half of which are based on the Gamecube. I decided on going with the mid to dark gray tone of the original Playstation because I think this looked best when paired with the Super Famicom buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Pro3's roots are in the retro space, it is very much a modern controller. I think it's interesting how third-party controllers used to be cheap knock-offs, but in the last 5 or 10 years, many gaming peripheral companies are creating controllers that can do more and work better than first-party controllers. They use more precise components that don't degrade over time and still sell them for cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Switch is the best example of this. Switch Joy-Cons are now infamous for developing "drift," sending unintended movements when you're trying to play. Switch Pro controllers also can develop drift, as well as Xbox and Playstation controllers. Modern premium third-party controllers use "hall-effect" style sticks that prevent this drift from happening, including the Pro3 controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's also interesting how the evolution of 8BitDo's Pro series somewhat mirrors their own development as a company. 8BitDo began as a company selling NES and SNES controllers that worked on original hardware and modern PCs. The SN30 was released in 2018 and the SN30 Pro came a year later, which added the twin sticks. In 2021, they released the Pro2 which aimed to make the controller more modern with ergonomic handles and programmable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their controllers became more and more modern, 8BitDo was expanding their focus from retro only to all modern platforms. In 2022, they released the Ultimate 1, their first controller that primarily targetted modern gaming. Now in 2025, they have brought all the features of their Ultimate controller series back to the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I did not care about the Pro3. While I love the Super Nintendo, it's flat-face design puts too much emphasis on nostalgia instead of ergonomics and comfortability. I think the Playstation 5's Dual Sense is the most comfortable controller I've ever used. It fits in my hand perfectly, and all the buttons are close enough and in exact positions that I only have to move my thumb to press something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting the Pro3, it does feel big and combersome. When I'm gripping the controller and focused on using the sticks for movement, my hands are too down the handle that I need to move them to hit UP or the Y-button. And I really need to move my hand to hit the Start and Select button in the middle. Sure, that's their nostalgic position in the middle, but having those buttons in the corner of the D-pad and the button array is their modern, more convenient position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe they should've made some considerations to sacrifice nostalgia. Although, after using it nearly a whole day playing Pokemon on Switch, I didn't have any problems, so maybe my brain is too wired on the Dual Sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 comes with a charging dock and USB-C cable. The charging dock doubles as a wireless receiver as hidden in the base of the dock is a USB-C 2.4ghz dongle. You can remove this dongle and use it on a Mac or Windows or plug this directly into the Switch 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also hidden in the dock are replacement buttons. The face buttons on the Pro3 are held in place by magnets. You can remove these buttons using the plunger tool and mix-n-max the buttons in any order you want. You can keep the buttons to match the Switch B-A layout, or flip them to fit Windows' A-B layout. You can also replace them with the rainbow buttons matching the Super Famicom layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do like the Pro3 and it is a strict upgrade from using the Dual Shock 4, which I had been using on the Switch and other consoles prior. I like the Dual Shock 4 a lot, but mine is a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller" title="/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller"&gt;custom repair job&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago. It feels rickety from the repair and once or twice the buttons don't work without a power cycle. It is also limited by its bluetooth connection, which requires a USB dongle for the switch. (I'm using the 8BitDo retro receiver.) And also the giant touch pad in the middle acts as the screenshot button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 feels solid and incredibly well made. Using bluetooth, it connects to the Switch natively without the need of a USB receiver, so it even works in handheld mode. You can go a step further and use the included 2.4ghz receiver, which gives a connection that makes the controller feel just as responsive as a wired connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 has now become my universal controller used on Switch, Mister, and other consoles with Bluetooth options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A Shiny Hunts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think having many extra buttons and back paddles on a controller is unnecessary, the biggest boon of the Pro3 is being able to program these buttons to perform macros. And this is particularly helpful with the most recent Pokemon game, Legends Z-A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all Pokemon games, you encounter, catch, and train Pokemon to be the best. However, when they spawn, every Pokemon has a base 1/4096 chance of becoming Shiny, an alternate colored version. These are highly sought after because of their rarity, even though they occasionally look terrible. In recent games, there have been methods which increase your chances of a shiny either through increased odds or increased spawns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legends Z-A has a different method through permanence. As you walk around Luminose City, Pokemon spawn and despawn from a 50m radius around your character. However, if a Pokemon spawns as a shiny, it will stay in memory. Even if it despawns, when it comes into view again, it will be shiny. This means that if your character is running around the world, it is constantly shiny checking Pokemon that will not disappear on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perfect for the Pro3 because you can program infinitely repeating movements for your character as a macro, let the macro run by itself, and come back to the games hours later to find tons of shiny Pokemon (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macros and Mac Problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To set macros on the Pro3, you must use 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2. This software is available on ios, macos, pc, and android. You also use this software to update the firmware on the controller and dongle. On Mac, the current version is v1.0.8, but when you update the firmware on the dongle, the dongle becomes stuck in boot mode, so the controller cannot connect to it. (The problem doesn't happen on Windows.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent an email to 8BitDo's support and they replied with an updated version of the software for Mac. Version 1.0.8 is from Sept 2025, but this one has a date of Oct 2025. Maybe it's a prerelease version of 1.0.9? Anyways, here's a link if you happen to need it: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs/ 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 for mac adapter boot.zip&lt;/a&gt;. Using this new version fixes my dongle's boot problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the controller is connected either through the dongle or a wired USB-C connection, you can click into its Switch settings and create a profile. Profiles can be switched on the fly, so you can set up 4 macros on one profile, and switch to another profile with another 4 macros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Mac, macros are built using controller inputs and refined after. You can't build them by scratch, which I think is possible on Windows. But, it's easier to just record input and mess with them after. Once a macro is built, it must be assigned to one of the 4 extra buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Froakie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Froakie, I used the following macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froakie spawns in the middle of Wild Zone 16, which is unlocked after reaching Rank C in the story. This macro is meant to be started after entering Wild Zone 5, though, which is right next to it. After entering Wild Zone 5 from the south, you can fast travel to Wild Zone 5 which puts you right in front of the entrance you just entered. Fast traveling like this rerolls and respawns all Pokemon, so putting this on an infinite loop will do a Froakie check every 20 seconds. It will reroll all surrounding Pokemon, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI, these timers are based on Switch 1 load times. Switch 2 would be faster, so you could tweak the times to be more efficient. It's pretty efficient on my Switch 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After setting this up, I sat in my bathtub for about 2 hours. When I returned, I already had a shiny Froakie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greninja is an excellent Shiny, plus it has a new Mega evolution. I thought he would be perfect for my team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Litwick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandelure is another strong Pokemon whom also has a new Mega evolution. I'm not a fan of its Shiny, but rare is rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litwick spawns in only three locations, two of which are near each other and all of which are in the sewers. You first visit these sewers right before reaching Rank C in the story. After that story sequence, they are closed off, but can be opened again through a side mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For shiny checks, we want to run down the hallway leading to the Litwicks. After they spawn, we want to run back to the beginning of the hallway. Rinse and repeat to infinite. Here's my macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was adapted from &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtvvjHf6XjoNOOor79sGWcAb-7cODfC4MxtP7dGHp2c/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABmop9o64*PyMj49AE9321GW2IhVd7fA#gid=1954077779" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtvvjHf6XjoNOOor79sGWcAb-7cODfC4MxtP7dGHp2c/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABmop9o64*PyMj49AE9321GW2IhVd7fA#gid=1954077779"&gt;PhillyBeatzU's Youtube Community&lt;/a&gt;. Each one of these I have had to tweak in some small way, so if you use any of these yourself, you might have to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This macro I left running all day while I went to work. I figured that I would return home to either my game being turned off because things went to sleep or ran out of batteries, or my character was stuck on the wall. Neither were the case, and I had two shiny Litwicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ralts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralts ultimately evolves into Gardevoir and Gallade. Psychic and Fairy moves have been very helpful in Pokemon Z-A so far, so I thought Gardevoir would be a good addition to my team. Gallade is a great Pokemon when catching other because it knows Hypnosis and False Swipe. False Swipe isn't in Z-A, so I'm not sure if Gallade is actually useful, but it's Psychic and Fighting might be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, two Ralts spawn in the overworld in the northwest in a grassy alcove of buildings. When you go in the area, there's a ladder that brings to the roof, right next to a bench. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a bench, you can progress time from day to night and night to day. This respawns all Pokemon just like fast traveling, but you don't have to worry about the day-night cycle. Choose the bench closest to the ladder, and use the following macro:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This macro was again adopted for PhillyBeatzU. It just holds down and hits the A button a bunch. There's a B button thrown in there in case it accidentally chooses to relax with Pokemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left this going all day while I was at work and came back to nothing on the first day. Although, there was a shiny Dedenne and Flabebe on other roofs nearby. The next day, I left it going again and I came back to TWO shiny Ralts. There was an Eevee on a nearby roof, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both Ralts had Adament natures, which is bad for Gardevoir, so the search continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Pokemon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm working on building my shiny team for the game's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next target is Delphox which has been instrumental in many of my fights. Chandelure and Gardevoir might replace its duties, but it's not a bad idea to have some redundancies. I need to progress to the story to Rank B to unlock the Wild Area that has Fennekin, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground is another very useful type in Pokemon Z-A and Mega Garchomp is going to be the best Ground type. Hunting that one is very annoying, though, as it only has a 10% chance of spawning in its area. Apparently, you can do some spawn manipulation to get them spawning 100% of the time. I might take the time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my team would be Greninja, Gardevoir, Gallade, Delphox, Garchomp, and Chandelure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...  I don't really have any good defense against Fairy and Water. I need steel and grass moves. I guess I should go after Beldum when I reach that point in the story. For Grass, having a shiny Meganium would be best, but those won't be available until after the story is complete. I think Gallade might have a good Grass move...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiny Hunting has been lucrative, but the passive brute force nature of it is not very engaging like it was in Legends Arceus or Pokemon Violet. Also, there is very little variety in the city and the low rez nature of the game makes it quite boring when compared with the open world games I've gone through this year on PS5. Katamari has more variety than this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I cannot find myself caring about this story. It's neat to see old characters from Pokemon X/Y come back, but the story wasn't all that great back then either, so I don't remember it at all. The last Pokemon story that I actually remember was Pokemon Black/White where the villains thought the idea of "enslaving" Pokemon in balls was cruel, which was an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of voice acting in Pokemon is really becoming apparent now, too. Every cutscene is endless textboxes with uninspired music in the background. It's sometimes hard to stay awake, let alone pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of the game is its new take on the battle system making it more of an arena fighter rather than a turn-by-turn RPG fighter. In my opinion, the most boring part of Pokemon has been fighting. It takes forever, and it's always just a means to an end. While not perfect, this arena-style battling is fresh and pretty fun. I would love to see this refined in future titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I think that is the game's only good point. Good = Battling. Bad = Graphics, Art, Music, Story, Characters, Exploration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'll continue playing much after completing the story and completing the Pokedex. I don't think I will go deep with Shiny hunting the way I had with other titles. I think I'll probably move on to another game or buy that Assassin's Creed DLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts</link><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/><category>Pokemon</category></item><item><title>MemCard Pro for Gamecube</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Memory cards for video game consoles in the late 90s through 2000s were an absolute necessity as disc-based media replaced traditional cartridges. Consoles didn't have internal storage, so these cards held all your saves. It was great for moving your saves around to a friend's house or using multiple game consoles, but if you played a lot of games, you ended up having A LOT of memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were several third party solutions at the time that offered cards with increased capacity and multiple pages, but they weren't always supported and often weren't as stable as official solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With retro gaming being so popular, 8BitMods has created a modern day solution to this problem that is incredibly stable. Last year, after putting together a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2 set up&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;MemCard Pro2&lt;/a&gt; was an essential part. It was one of the most incredible pieces of the set up as I was able to bring all my saves from 25 years ago into the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the MemCard Pro2, the second version of the Memcard was created for the Gamecube, titled the &lt;b&gt;MemCard Pro GC&lt;/b&gt;. They are currently working on a fourth version of the Memcard for exclusive use on the Dreamcast, the VMU Pro. I can't wait for that. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MemCard GC has the same functionality of the PS2 version, complete with WiFi, online memory card page navigation, and Game ID recognition to create unique memory cards for each game. All game saves and information are stored on a micro SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I had planned on &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;modding my Gamecube with the FlippyDrive&lt;/a&gt;, I bought a MemCard Pro GC, which complemented my replacement shell quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard set up for the MemCard Pro GC is mostly the same as it is for the MemCard Pro2. I wrote about those &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; last year. However, transferring saves from old memory cards is a much different process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro SD Card&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Memcard, you'll need an SD card. So, how big did you need? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory cards for the Gamecube were released in 512kb, 2mb, and 8mb sizes. The 8mb card had 1019 blocks available for saves. Most games take up between 3 and 20 blocks, so even as the largest, the 8mb card could hold saves for 50 games. 1gb could hold 125 of those big 8mb memory cards, which would be enough for 6250 games on their own. So, 64gb could hold saves for how many games? 400,000. A number far higher than the number of games released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;64gb is obviously overkill, but a 64gb micro SD card is less than $10 these days. If you don't have a smaller card lying around, it's not too expensive to get a new one. You'll never have to worry about space again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firmware Set Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Memcard wants the SD card formatted in either FAT32 or ExFat. Either is okay, so I went with ExFat. I downloaded the &lt;a href="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public" title="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public"&gt;Latest Firmware&lt;/a&gt; and copied the files onto the card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended downloading a previous version and using the web interface to update it to the most recent version, but I had a lot of problems with that. Don't do that! Just download the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;WiFi Set Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the MemCard Pro is its web interface. Setting up WiFi allows you to change memory cards from the computer rather than hitting buttons on the device. You can also create new cards of various sizes, update firmware, and change around other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you initially insert the Memcard into the Gamecube and turn it on, the screen will ask you to set up WiFi. The Memcard is broadcasting now, and wants you to connect to its signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SSID password is mcpadmin&lt;/b&gt;.

So, you cannot have JP saves sitting alongside NA saves on the same card. Often, the Gamecube will ask you reformat your card when you use it in the wrong region, which would erase all your saves. There aren't any options for the Memcard to set a region for the card. I think once a card is created, you have to manually format it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, some saves are copy protected! Phantasy Star Online, F-Zero GX, Pokemon Colosseum, Fire Emblem, and a few others won't allow you to copy saves using the Gamecube. Some of these are simple flags preventing the copy. However, PSO and F-Zero go a step further by locking the save to the serial number of the memory card. Even if you transferred the save, it would not function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you need some help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamecube Memory Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/suloku/gcmm/releases" title="https://github.com/suloku/gcmm/releases"&gt;Gamecube Memory Manager&lt;/a&gt;, or GCMM, is a homebrew application for the Gamecube, denoted by the &lt;code&gt;dol&lt;/code&gt; file extension. Using this program, you can easily move save files to an SD card and back to a different card. It is way faster than the Gamecube UI, plus you can move copy protected saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To run this, you need a modded Gamecube&lt;/b&gt;. I don't think there's any way of burning this to a disc and having a retail unit run it without help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All homebrew apps work just like disc ISOs on modded Gamecubes, so stick the &lt;code&gt;dol&lt;/code&gt; file with your games, and boot up your Gamecube. Run the app, and you'll get this screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will complain about not having any FAT device connected, and it won't allow you to do any of the actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;My Gamecube is modded with the FlippyDrive&lt;/a&gt;, but I think PicoBoot and some others might have the same problem. The FlippyDrive is bypassing the Disc Reader to send data to the Gamecube. The disc reader is not a writeable storage device, so I cannot send my saves to the FlippyDrive. Not to mention my FlippyDrive's SD card is ExFat, not FAT32, which is what GCMM wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the MemCard Pro is only emulating standard cards. It is not a full storage expansion. Plus, that SD card is also ExFat, not FAT32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a little while to figure this out, but we need a physical FAT32 device to use as storage for our saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;SD2SP2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a device called the SD2SP2 for the Gamecube that acts as a FAT32 storage device for the Gamecube. It is widely available. I bought this one for 999&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; on Amazon with Next Day delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 ports on the bottom of the Gamecube. In practice, one port is used for the Gameboy Player, one port is used for the modem or broadband adapter, and the other port was never used. The unused port is called the Serial Port 2. It's possible developers used this for debugging retail Gamecubes, but its main purpose these days is being used for extra storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After assembling the pieces of the SD2SP2 together and putting in an SD card, it plugs in Serial Port 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't like how this looks. I guess it's supposed to make access to the SD card convenient, but the connection to the serial port isn't perfect. It feels like it will easily fall out. I would much rather have an earlier version that doesn't have the flat bottom, so I could use the port cover to lock it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD Card must be formatted as FAT32, of course. Once everything is plugged in, GCMM immediately detected it on start up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9370.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9370.webp"&gt;I did full raw backups of each of my memory cards.&lt;/a&gt; Only 5 memory cards this time compared with my mountain of 20+ cards on Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at this point, we're done with the SD2SP2. You don't need to use GCMM to restore backups on the MemCard Pro. And even so, it won't let you do full backups because the memory card serial numbers don't match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next move is on the computer to make these backups workable on the Memcard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory Card Save Splitting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the Memcard is using Game ID to automatically create and switch to a memory card devoted to a single game. Then, you never have to worry about save space. All of my original memory cards had saves from multiple games (as did all of ours), so we want to split all of these up. And we have a program to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodgit created a command line &lt;a href="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro" title="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro"&gt;Memcard save splitting program&lt;/a&gt; to be used with Playstation 1 and Gamecube saves. Just download the latest release and stick it in the directory with your saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD2SP2 created backup files with the &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; file extension, and that's the same file extension used on the MemCard Pro, Dolphin, and all other Gamecube emulators. It's the standard Gamecube Memory Card file format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; on our raws, we get individual cards for each game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the command in text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;./memcardpro split [folder-name] [memory-card-name].raw&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games are separated into folders matching their Game IDs, which is how the MemCard Pro references game unique cards. Add all those folders in the &lt;code&gt;MemoryCards&lt;/code&gt; directory on your Memcard, and they will all be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, I didn't have nearly as many saves as Playstation. Around 30 unique game saves on Gamecube compared to 53 on PS1 and 89 on PS2. But these saves are all pretty special, especially my old Animal Crossing save. Now I can view my house from 20-some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to get 7 NES games back in the day!

But, Archades Games on YouTube was a huge help. His videos on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0"&gt;backing up saves&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0"&gt;save transfer guide&lt;/a&gt; pushed me in the right direction, along with his set up guides for the MemCard Pro2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many options for playing Gamecube games these days, but if you're still using original hardware, I think the MemCard Pro GC is your best option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Modding the Gamecube with Flippy Drive</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Completing my collection of millenium modded Japanese consoles, I turn to the Gamecube. Overall, it was a solid piece of hardware that had a lot of interesting games and peripherals. There's not a whole lot of bad things you can say about it, except for a slight lack of games. Many publishers were still burnt from the N64 and didn't return. Also, the Playstation 2 was getting huge expansive RPGs that never appeared on this platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are several unique and incredible experiences that became exclusive to the Gamecube. Many of these were from Nintendo themselves, but Capcom, Namco, and Sega helped out. Animal Crossing, Pikmin, Monkey Ball, F-Zero GX, Viewtiful Joe, Baten Kaitos, Resident Evil series revival, Resident Evil 4, and two incredible Legend of Zelda games. Also, Square finally put Final Fantasy back on Nintendo with Crystal Chronicles. It seemed like the curse of the N64 may have been broken, but Playstation 2's shadow was too vast to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have modded the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="/modding-a-sega-dreamcast"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I would do the same with the Gamecube. And here it is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few hiccups along the way, but it works flawlessly and I'm able to use and manage my 20-year-old saves, too. The main hardware mod that drives my Gamecube is the FlippyDrive on the inside paired with a MemcardPro and the Bitfunx HDMI adapter on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parts List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to the FlippyDrive from yet another one of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPq48Wm8y-U" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPq48Wm8y-U"&gt;Tito's MachoNacho videos&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. After completing my Playstation 2 set up, the idea of modding consoles no longer seemed impossible to me. The FlippyDrive was an internal mod, but it required no soldering and no damage to the original console. Plus, it was a disc reader bypass, so you could still use game discs as normal. Additionally, it was cheap at only $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FlippyDrive was being funded through CrowdSupply and the campaign was still going at the time, so I purchased a deluxe kit on September 9th 2024. It eventually shipped almost exactly a year later on September 11th 2025. In preparation, I purchased several other things to complement the mod:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My full parts list is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;- FlippyDrive Deluxe Kit with Ethernet Adapter and Back Plate&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension" title="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension"&gt;FlippyDrive SD Card Extension&lt;/a&gt; (from Laser Bear)&lt;br/&gt;- MemCardPro GC (from 8BitMods)&lt;br/&gt;- HDMI Adapter (from Bitfunx / Aliexpress)&lt;br/&gt;- Shell Replaement - Grape Translucent (from Aliexpress)&lt;br/&gt;- ...and later, I bought an SD2SP2 adapter from Amazon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using all components required &lt;b&gt;THREE&lt;/b&gt; SD cards. I'm using a 64gb for the MemCard, a 128gb for the SD2SP2, and a 512gb card for the FlippDrive to hold all the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up for the MemCard Pro was a bit messier than I originally thought, so I have detailed that journey &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube" title="/memcard-pro-for-gamecube"&gt;in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;. This post will focus on the Gamecube mods themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlippyDrive Software Preparation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive is a new mod for the Gamecube amongst a community of already established mods. Its selling point is ease of installation, a more native-looking UI, and a cheap price point. But because it is still so new, I had trouble finding information about how I should prepare the SD card. The Playstation 2 and Dreamcast had very esoteric file structures, so I assumed I had to do something weird here, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the case. You can keep the SD card in ExFat format, and just dump the Gamecube ISOs in the root directory. That's it. There's no specific naming format or folder structure. You can make folders if you want to organize some games, but that's unnecessary. Each Gamecube game is around 1.1gb or 1.4gb, so my 512gb SD card can hold everything I would ever want to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiki has &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/usage.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/usage.html"&gt;some details about SD card prep&lt;/a&gt;, but it's really nothing. Just format the card as ExFat and put in the ISOs. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; it currently does not support RVZ files, which is the common Dolphin compressed format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamecube Teardown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to installing the FlippyDrive, I will be replacing almost all of the outer shell with this Grape Translucent one. Here are all the parts included in the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came with the screwdrivers required for the teardown, and so many many parts. This was way more parts than those included with the Dreamcast replacement kit. (Although, the Dreamcast kit already had the upper shell preassembled.) The box did not come with any instructions, but by following the teardown of the Gamecube, it's not difficult to figure out where everything goes and how things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with experience from the Dreamcast shell replacement, I made the decision to not completely replace everything. I wanted to keep the front gray controller plate, the Gamecube Logo plate on top, and maybe a few other things. I was already not going to use the back plate because I had &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8991.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8991.webp"&gt;a replacement for the ethernet port&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gamecube shell is held together with only four hexagonal screws. They are removed with &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8992.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8992.webp"&gt;the included orange-handled screw driver&lt;/a&gt;. These are the only weird screws in the console. All others are Phillips head screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I decided to start work on the upper shell before continuing with the teardown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upper Shell Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there were no instructions, but it was easy to look at the factory assembled shell and figure out which pieces went where and how things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9008.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9008.webp"&gt;the black lid cover with the Gamecube logo&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that I wanted to use the black handle and the black vent cover in my build. I thought &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9007.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9007.webp"&gt;the black handle looked very attractive&lt;/a&gt; with the shell rather than having the shell be a complete single color. Also, &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9001.webp"&gt;the vent cover included in the kit was terrible.&lt;/a&gt; The original cover had a mesh screen for preventing dust from entering. The new cover was just a plastic piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assembling the lid took some acrobatics with the springs. Actually, attaching the handle on first blocked some of the components, so I had to remove it before proceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I figured out that the spring must be connected to its bracket and then fitted into the hole from the inside at the same time as the tray is being fitted from the outside. These two pieces need to connect to each other through the hole, and then the bracket needs to be screwed into place before it falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a while, but eventually it got in there and I could screw it down. Then the bracket on the other side slips into place, and becomes secure with a screw. Finally, the handle goes on over both parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lid latching mechanism was much less difficult to fit into place. When the Open Tray button is depressed, the mechanism rotates to release the tray, and the spring snaps it back into place. It is much stronger and fail-resistent compared with the Dreamcast lid hatching component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new shell, I put the button in first and put the bracket on above it. I think you can do it in either order, though. For the bracket, I fit the spring into the raised side with part of the spring going through the hole. I pulled tension on the spring and fit it on the screw peg. The screw should not be screwed too tightly, as there needs to be enough freedom for the bracket to move back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My kit only came with one widened screw, but the component is so solid, that once the top screw is in place, it holds everything perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final pieces of the upper shell are the buttons. The Power and Reset buttons are easily snapped into their holes. I decided to take the gray Power button from the original console and reuse it. It can easily be removed &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9042.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9042.webp"&gt;by pushing the pins from the inside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one more piece, the clear plastic piece for the console light. But, I am replacing that with &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9049.webp"&gt;Laser Bear's SD Card extension&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm going to install that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an hour and a half, the upper shell is complete, and I think it looks fantastic. The black and gray perfectly complement the solid color everywhere else, and it looks like an official alternate color of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to continue the teardown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower Shell Teardown and Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main componenet in the lower shell is the disc reader. It is held on with 18 screws around its perimeter, but we need to get to all of them first. First, &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9071.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9071.webp"&gt;the back panel comes off easily&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, the front controller panel is held in place &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9073.webp"&gt;with plastic latches on the side&lt;/a&gt;. Just pop those out and the controller panel comes free. It is still connected to the base with a ribbon cable, so pull that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the fan is held in place with two screws. The power plug can be detached with a little force and a little wiggle. After that, just start removing all the screws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept all the screws in order of where I pulled them from, but with the exception of the controller port screws, they're all the same. The replacement shell kit did not come with replacement screws, so I will reuse all of these during reassembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the screws removed, the disc reader is held in place by its plug on the motherboard. Again, gentle force, gentle wiggle and it comes right off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, if I weren't doing a shell replacement, I could begin the FlippyDrive installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue the teardown, these six screws must be removed. It may look like their purpose is to secure the hintsink, but they go through the motherboard into the bottom shell. When removed, my heatsink stayed pretty solid on my motherboard. I did not have to worry about it slipping off. I'm not sure if something else secured it other than the thermal paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the screws are removed, the motherboard assembly is only held in place by its bottom plug in the power converter below, like the disc reader was. So, it comes off with some more wiggling. This exposes a metal plate held on with four screws. Remove those and we're nearly at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the remaining pieces are just sitting in place and can be easily picked up, except for the power converter. That has another four screws that are easily removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're now finally at the bottom and can start putting components into their new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the components go back into the same position in the new shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the new shell is resin, not injection molded like the original. This means screw holes have not been primed AND they are slightly fragile. You don't want to over tighten or tighten too quickly. &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9165.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9165.webp"&gt;Otherwise, you might sheer the screw post.&lt;/a&gt; Often, I would move the screw back and forth in its hole to create enough room for it to naturally tighten further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before continuing too far, I removed the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9100.webp"&gt;rubber feet&lt;/a&gt; from the original shell and transferred them to the new one. The replacement shell came with plastic ones that seemed stupid. I didn't use any tactics pulling out these feet. I just yanked em out! So, I damaged them slightly. They didn't stay flush in place in the new shell, so I used some epoxy to glue them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going step-by-step, &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9094.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9094.webp"&gt;I added on the power converter&lt;/a&gt; and screwed it in. Next was &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9098.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9098.webp"&gt;the metal plate&lt;/a&gt; with its screws. And then &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9102.webp"&gt;the motherboard plugged into the power converter&lt;/a&gt;, and the six screws going through the heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disc reader is the next component to add, but we need to install the FlippyDrive first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlippyDrive Installation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are all the remaining components left for the lower half along with the FlippyDrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the FlippDrive we have the ribbon cable which sits in the disc reader plug, the FlippyDrive itself, its mounting bracket, the molded back plate with an ethernet port, the ethernet port, and a ribbon cable connecting the port to the drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive Wiki has an &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/installation/flippydrive.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/installation/flippydrive.html"&gt;excellent installation guide&lt;/a&gt;, which I mostly ignored because I had already watched Tito's YouTube video and assembly seemed obvious. This caused a few problems later with the order of assembly, so READ the intructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is making a series of folds on the FlippyDrive's ribbon cable so it can recess in the disc plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to make this wacky W-shape with the folds. The valleys will go into the plug with the middle contacts sitting on the connectors in the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should fit in the plug like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excess ribbon cable should &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9130.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9130.webp"&gt;fold around some of the case plugs&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for the next step, which is reinstalling the disc reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9133.webp"&gt;narrow slit&lt;/a&gt; in each of the corners of the disc reader assembly where the metal is bent downwards. We want to position the ribbon cable so it is fed through that slit as the assembly is pushed onto the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, all we'll see is the end of the cable coming out of that corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next move is screwing in the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9143.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9143.webp"&gt;mounting bracket near the cable&lt;/a&gt;. The bracket has an extra slot for the screw that is no longer used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippDrive is then plugged into the cable and can then be mounted on the bracket. Depress the ribbon cable gate &lt;b&gt;from the middle of the gate!&lt;/b&gt; Not from the edges. The instructions make a huge point of saying you'll most likely damage the gate by closing on the edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive is now done! But I have two more components to install, the SD card extension and the ethernet port. However, here's where I did a few things out of order because I wasn't following the instructions. This resulted in some backtracking. Here's the correct order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, because I'm using the SD card extension, that ribbon cable should be fed through one of the mounting posts and behind the mounting bracket. This is what &lt;a href="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension" title="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension"&gt;the official installation guide&lt;/a&gt; says. Look at the video on that page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connector is then &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9220.webp"&gt;folded back into the SD card slot&lt;/a&gt; on the FlippyDrive. This makes the cable pretty snug in the shell keeping it from getting crushed during reassembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the ethernet port in the back is a VERY tight fit. If the disc reader has been fastened in place with all its screws, the port bumps up against the disc lid sensor on the top and the screw underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to remove all screws holding the disc reader in place so I could slightly lift the disc reader assembly and wedge the port in place as the disc reader assembly was correctly set. This results in a second unused screw. This time, there is no extra place on a bracket to put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Third, I put the ethernet cable in backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue bit goes on the outside not the inside.  LACES OUT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything plugged in, the FlippyDrive just snaps into its mounting bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier versions of the FlippyDrive used tiny screws on the bracket, but they figured out a really convenient way of just having it snap in place instead. It's very solid, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the FlippyDrive installed, it's time to start screwing. Cue the Michael Scott references, but many of the holes were tight and required a lot of back and forth to get everything in correctly. Some of the screws couldn't even go in all the way because things were too tight. So, there are a few screws slightly raised because I didn't want to completely strip them trying to force them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything screwed in, I had dreaded &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9174.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9174.webp"&gt;putting in the controller port ribbon cable&lt;/a&gt;, but that was surprisingly easy. The blue tape made the cable strong enough to be pushed into its plug on the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the final step, one more piece had to be screwed in, the other end of the SD card extender into the power light position on the top. &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9215.webp"&gt;It fit perfectly&lt;/a&gt;, and the screws went in easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally at the end! When reassembling the two halves, you should always pop the lid! The back of the lid hits &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9278.webp"&gt;the small fragile sensors&lt;/a&gt; in the back. These can easily be broken with too much force. Also, I had to make sure the SD card extender cable was correctly going behind the controller port assembly and in front of the disc reader. Not squished between other components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything in place, it took a little bit of wiggling and force to get it closed, but it eventually snapped on. Then I screwed the outer shell screws to secure it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked so great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD card was very discrete and easily accessible on the outside. The back had an ethernet port. I will probably never use it, but maybe I'll try PSO someday? I do have &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9241.webp"&gt;the official broadband adapter&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom, but this doesn't give me access to the FlippyDrive on my network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought it into the other room, plugged it into the TV, and... all my games immediately appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked on the first try. It was so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole build took me over 4 hours, but some of that was a little trial and error and a little Internet research on figuring out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;CubeBoot (aka FlippyDrive OS)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received the Rev9 version of FlippyDrive which came with version 1.4.6 preinstalled. Loading is quite quick and the Gamecube automatically boots into CubeBoot. CubeBoot is the FlippyDrive's native game selection UI. Swiss has become the standard for Gamecube, but FlippyDrive wanted to provide something that felt more native to the Gamecube's own UI. I like this WAY more than just choosing games from a text list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the UI is very barebones. You can only choose games. There are no menus or settings available on the Gamecube itself. There is nowhere to configure Internet settings, and set up Bluetooth for a controller. All configuration is done with a config file on the SD card. &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/configuration.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/configuration.html"&gt;Details are here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, Bluetooth has not been implemented for controllers, so I can't do anything there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you use the ethernet port, you don't need to do any Internet configuration since that is for WiFi only. But, besides playing games on the Internet, ethernet is only used for moving files around on the FlippyDrive. I can easily access the SD card by removing it from the extension, so I don't need that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the outside, I'm using two major accessories, the MemCard Pro from 8BitMods and the HDMI adapter from Bitfunx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MemCard Pro is an amazing device that manages all game saves. Through CubeBoot, it will automatically select and/or create a memory card specific for that game. Set up for the MemCard Pro &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube" title="/memcard-pro-for-gamecube"&gt;continues in its own post&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little messy getting my original saves onto it, but I figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HDMI adapter is really great, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bitfunx HDMI adapter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best possible image you can get from a Gamecube is using the RGB component cables. But, those can be expensive, plus you'll need an additional device to convert the signal into HDMI for your TV. This HDMI adapter does that and much more. Plus, it was only $25 on Aliexpress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Dreamcast HDMI adapter, this is not doing any upscaling to 1080p. It is receiving the raw signal from the Gamecube and slightly massaging it to the nearest standard HD resolution. You could then pass this into your own upscaler, or just plug it in the TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unlike the Dreamcast HDMI adapter, you have options. &lt;a href="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo" title="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo"&gt;GCVideo comes preinstalled&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you linedoubling and scanlines. These are all options you would have on an OSSC, but it's nice to have them in a device that has everything working perfectly by default. You can access this menu using the included remote. &lt;a href="https://www.bitfunx.com/product/bitfunx-hdmi-line-doubler-adapter-gc2hdmi-for-nintendo-gamecube-ngc-digital-to-hdmi/" title="https://www.bitfunx.com/product/bitfunx-hdmi-line-doubler-adapter-gc2hdmi-for-nintendo-gamecube-ngc-digital-to-hdmi/"&gt;There are more details on the product page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My TV does not have an option to change the aspect ratio to 4:3, but there are several games that have widescreen support including &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9457.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9457.webp"&gt;F-Zero GX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9430.webp"&gt;Monkey Ball&lt;/a&gt;.

I can play all of my old games. I can also play hacks and special versions of games including &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9462.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9462.webp"&gt;F-Zero AX&lt;/a&gt;, although that doesn't allow saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think modding a Wii or a Wii U might end up being the better option. You would have access to all of those libraries in addition to Gamecube. Also, Triforce games (F-Zero AX and Mario Kart Arcade GP) run natively on Wii and Wii U. I will probably look into this in the future, but I am content with this for now. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Mister, Analogue Pocket, modded Playstation 2, Dreamcast, and the Gamecube, I can play all of my favorite games from the past up through the mid-Bush years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Assassin's Creed Shadows</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Assassin's Creed series finds its way to shove its story into fuedal Japan during Oda Nobunaga's conquest and unification. The long storied franchise which had always focused on Europe and the western expansion of the world spread itself to Japan via the attempted Catholic infiltration and invasion of the country. Like all AC games, you find yourself at a pivotal point in time, and carry out assassinations that shape the country's and world's history to create the world we live in today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows takes place around the year of 1579. Looking at real world history, the bulk of the story is set from 1581 through 1582, but also flashbacks to 1579, where those events serve at the catalyst for one of the protagonist's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe is a young woman from Iga whose family and village are trained in ninjutsu. She was first tested in 1579 when Oda Nobukatsu (Nobunaga's son) launched an unsuccessful attack on their village. Clumsily, she killed her first man as the rest of the ninja repeled the attack. From that day, she continued her hard training to match the level of the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1581 (real life), Oda Nobunaga returned to Iga with his army of over 40,000 men, and slaughtered as many ninja and families as he could find. In the chaos, Naoe's father gathers an important artifact and flees. Naoe follows, but they are both run down by a &lt;i&gt;mysterious&lt;/i&gt; group of 12 masked individuals who call themselves the Shinbakufu. They steal the artifact and brutally injure both Naoe and her father. Her father dies as she loses consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe wakes later in a monastery healed by a boy and an old man. After regaining her strength she vows revenge against Oda Nobunga for slaughtering her village and the Shinbakufu for killing her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewinding a little bit, we are introduced to our other protagonist first, Yasuke. Yasuke is Nobunaga's Black samurai. His main story also begins in 1579 as Jesuit Alessandro Valignano brings him to Osaka as he meets with Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is curious about the black man as almost no one in Japan had ever seen a black person before. They've only ever met white Catholics. Nobunaga is impressed that Yasuke understands the Japanese language, and invites (orders) him to train at his castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Yasuka trains, he learns how a samurai should properly fight by balancing physical strength with mental strength. A duel between men is not just who is stronger, but how you can use your opponent's weaknesses against them. Through achieving this balance and showing his loyalty and honor in a fight, Nobunaga is so impressed that he "knights" him as a samurai. This is when Yasuke proclaims his name as "Yasuke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later in 1581, he is one of the samurai on the front lines attacking the Iga village, Naoe's village. The full game begins with you storming the village and killing ninja after ninja. You play about 15 minutes as him until the game switches to Naoe fleeing the village, and then you don't play him again until many hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Naoe leaves the temple fully healed from her attack, you have nearly free reign of the entire expansive map of pre-Edo Period Kansai. The distances are miniaturized, but the huge map goes from the Kii province in the south (modern day Wakayama) to Wakasa province in the north (modern day southern Fukui). You can travel to Omi province in the east (modern day Shiga, almost Gifu) to Harima and Tamba provinces in the west (modern day Hyogo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visit incredible recreations of Himeji, Osaka, and Niji castles and estates, as well as over a dozen more castles. Armored forts also dot the landscape and there are vibrant towns both large and rich, and small and poor. Outside of the villages, the forests and mountains look incredible. The overall attention to authentic details is amazing. It feels like I'm walking through the forests of Sekighara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These natural, beautiful, and authentic environments are the center piece of Assassin's Creed Shadows. If you see something interesting in a direction, just go in that direction and see what's there. Eventually you find vantage points (towers) that will reveal more points of interest and this curiosity and exploration will continue to push you to all areas of the map. Often at the top of a hill, you'll see a new castle or fort you haven't explored before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in gaming, the idea of "Do you see that building or mountain in the distance? You can go there." is pretty rote, but Assassin's Creed established and populaized this concept of open world exploration in its first game nearly 18 years ago. Actually, the first game is the only other AC game I've played of the whole series. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-impressions" title="/assassins-creed-impressions"&gt;I wrote some impressions back then, too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to go anywhere and having towers to organically push players into new areas was what made Assassin's Creed such an interesting game that it became a watershed moment, and nearly all other open world games have adopted this idea. Nintendo even took this idea with Zelda Breath of the Wild and it became one of their most highest selling and praised games of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why so Special?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why is Assassin's Creed Shadows so special? Why should you play it? There are really just 3 short reasons. It's a really good "one of those." The graphics looks incredible. And it's set in Japan. Those are really the 3 reasons why people have been so positive about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assassin's Creed has been plagued with mediocre games for years. Once they struck gold with the first games, they kept pumping them out each year. There have been 14 mainline AC games in the last 18 years. And so many of them have been boring, broken, overwhelming, and completely uninteresting according to people. But, it was able to break into the mainstream, so every release kept selling and selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play it because Ghosts of Tsushima was released a few years and seemed to do exactly what Assassin's Creed was doing. It was an open world set in feudal Japan where you run around and reach towers to unlock more points of interest on the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions" title="/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions"&gt;I did and did not like Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. From an exploration point of view, it was a bit derivative fully using the same formula as Assassin's Creed, but it was a good "one of those." You could climb almost everywhere and there were interesting hidden points as you explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never wrote my full thoughts on the game, but there were three major things I ultimately really disliked about Ghosts that are (mostly) fixed in Shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest thing I hated about Ghosts was the overall tone of the story and sidequests. Everything was a fucking downer. Of course, the overall story of Ghosts was about the mongul invasion which is a serious subject, but Japanese cinema and story-telling like to add a bit of lightheartedness to their tales. Every sidequest in Ghosts ends with a family murdered, or a town murdered, or any shred of hope dashed in the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My father has gone missing. Can you find him?" He's been robbed and murdered by bandits. "My wife is missing. Can you find her?" Murdered and ripped apart by bandits or monguls. "My children are missing. Can you find them?" Worked to death as slaves in a mongul camp. Why create such a beautiful lush environment only to dot it with the charred remains of villages and bodies of families and children? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, balance is important. Maybe they wanted to balance to beauty of the environment with death. But with the narrative so completely overwhelmed with negatives feelings and imagery, it dwarves the environment. You need some balance within your narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows has a few different side story threads that are pretty ridiculous, especially the Yokai quest line. Much of these goofy quests remind me a lot of the goofy kind of side quests you would find the Yakuza games, the premiere Japanese developed open world game series. Even though they are sometimes too goofy, they play well against the main character who tends to play the straight-man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows never drags me down in the same way that Ghosts did. Although, eventually in the story, I think Naoe and Yasuke become a little too jokey with each other and other characters, so the tone ends up going in the wrong direction a little too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I will say that Jin in Ghosts ends up being a much better developed character throughout the story. Naoe and Yasuke often become more of an avatar for the player, and you can often make choices that contradict the cutscenes and dont't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repetitious Layouts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows hides its repitious buildings, foilage, and enemy layouts with a vast amount of variety. There really aren't all that many different models of trees in the game, but when placed in the environment along the sides of mountains and occasionally in towns, you really don't notice the repetition unless you really pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your base is a great example of this. In Shadows, you get a base and can put together the buildings, trees, and lots of other things anyway you like. I can create a pretty natural looking forest by rotating every tree I place. Combined together, you can't really tell which branches are the same on each tree. The photo below is from my base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some buildings in Shadows are obviously the same, but it doesn't really bother me too much. In real life, there are many houses that are the same because they all hired the same construction company. Also, many textures are reused in other castles and towns. But the layouts of all the castles and town are unique and are often historically accurately the layouts of the castles and towns they are meant to be. Towns and castles also have a lot of unique features that are not used anywhere in the game. Often, the developers tear down some walls or buildings to break up the repetition, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ghosts, all the mongul tents and camp set ups looked identical. Again, it makes sense that they would all have the same tents, but every tent had the treasures and weapons laid out in the exact same position. Each tent also had a same flap exposed in the exact same position so you could sneak in. Tents were almost also laid out in the exact position in every camp, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows also has various army and bandit camps with repeated layouts, but you have so many other castles, villages, estates, caves, mines, towers, and other places where you fight that there is so much variety among repeated elements. They don't hold back their layouts for story sequences only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authenticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghosts prides itself on authenticity. Despite being an American game studio, they took multiple trips to Tsushima island to study the natural landscape, attended workshops focused on the island's culture and traditions, took tons of reference photos, and were also huge fans of classic Japanese samurai cinema, especially of Kurosawa. They used all of this knowledge to create beautiful environments that look like paintings and still images from their favorite films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it felt like a fairytale. Open areas of tall grass blowing like waves in the wind. Rocky mountainous hills with tall cedar trees. Vast marshlands filled with those white marshy flowers. And also snowy mountains to the north so cold that you can't survive away from a fire for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Ghosts prisdes itself on authenticity, but are we supposed to believe this is an actual place? Tsushima is an island in the sea of Japan, which rarely gets snow. And those white marsh flowers only grow in marshes in the mountains, usually around May. Ghosts takes place in November. Also, there's a cherry blossom forest in November, what?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted to shove in too much imagery into a situation that doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environments in Shadows is much more consistent with reality. Also, seasons change over time. Every real-life hour (about) half a season in the year scrolls by. (This also allows for enemies to respawn and match your level.) Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring. In summer, all the forests are a deep green like normal. Rice fields are planted and flooded. In fall, the leaves begin to turn, but also, people are out in the fields harvesting the rice. In winter, snow becomes deep in the north, but it's pretty bare in the south near the ocean, just like real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the seasons changing, it allows them to have all the imagery of Japan that Ghosts wanted to have in a more natural way. The attention to detail in each of the different regions depending on the season is incredible. It feels like the seasons changing in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shallow Story and Characters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think Shadows excels best at exploring the environment, running through castles looting and killing, and naturally finding side story threads, it ultimately feels a bit shallow. Naoe and Yasuke are so stereotypical in their actions and dialogue. There's no weight behind anything they say or do. Everything in the story is telegraphed to the point where there are no real twists or turns. When you meet someone who seems remotely evil... Ah! I'll have to fight or kill this guy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I've spent hours upon hours looting and killing everyone in the castles and forts that when the story says we "need to be careful" and "have a plan" to attack this specific character in a castle I've already been, it's laughable. Here's my plan: I'll just run in there and kill everyone just as I always do. And eventually that's what happens in the story. No build up needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story, dialogue, and character development of Ghosts had so much more weight behind it. Although, the story decisions in Ghosts also fell flat in the end when you just choose which ending to watch with your final action. All your actions throughout the game didn't mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shadows, it was interesting to see how they weaved the overall Assassin's Creed story into Japanese history, but I could've easily just read a bullet point list on a wikipedia page and been just as satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;End of Act 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the story, in Act 1, we were running around as Naoe searching for leads on Oda Nobunaga to exact our revenge. Through various story threads, we meet Akechi Mitsuhide (one of Nobunaga's trusted generals). He tells Naoe that Nobunaga is one of the Shinbakufu, and he sets us up with an opportunity to kill Nobunaga at Honnoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events happen in the same way they supposed did in real history in June 1582. Mitsuhide unsuspectingly lead his army into Kyoto and attacked Honnoji. You are able to use the chaos to fight your way through samurai into the temple where Oda Nobunaga stayed. The temple is set on fire, and you fight Nobunaga while the temple burns down around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the final blow, Yasuke appears for the first time in hours to prevent your assassination. But the attack was successful either way. Nobunaga says that even if he were to flee, he reign as daimyo is over. He could never command his groups with authority again after this betrayal. He asks Yasuke to take his head as he commits seppuku due to his failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe flees the temple. Akechi revealed himself to be one of the Shinbakufu, not Nobunaga. With Nobunaga dead, unification of Japan stands still as the other generals and daimyo know fight for power. Akechi hopes to gain some power for himself, but there are so many rivals in his way. Naoe feels betrayed that she was only used as a pawn in his schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuke soon catches up with her. Naoe weilds a hidden spring-loaded palm knife that she had gotten from her father. She has used to assassinate all her targets so far and it's an iconic staple of all assassins through the AC franchise. Yasuke recognizes this blade. So, rather than fight Naoe out of loyalty for Nobunaga, he asks to join her. Akechi is their common enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining story of Shadows happens in two acts, but the focus of each of these acts happen nearly concurrently. Act 2 story quests focus on elimating the remaining members of the Shinbakufu and eventually reaching Akechi to kill him. Act 3 quests focus on the pasts of Naoe and Yasuke. How did Naoe's father know about the league of assassins and how did they come to Japan? Also, how is Yasuke tangled up with the assassins by knowing about the hidden blade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After tracking down and killing all members of the Shinbakufu, you come to the final battle. Akechi is in Yamazaki castle, and you build your plans to attack with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. You meet a young Tokugawa Ieyasu (above) who takes his army away and doesn't join the battle, claiming that there will be more fighting in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's neat that you meet all three unifiers of Japan in the game. Oda Nobunaga began his campaigns to unify Japan, but was killed before he could complete it. Toyotomi is the second unifier, taking over for Oda in 1582 just after this battle where Akechi is rooted and killed. Nearly all areas of rebellion were quelled and brought under their power by 1592. Then, with Toyotomi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu prevailed in &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara" title="/battle-of-sekigahara"&gt;the Battle of Sekighara&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed him to seize all power of Japan and usher in an era of peace (albeit under strict rule) for 250 years. It's funny how they protray him as a coward and schemer here as folks in Japan often have the same view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Toyotomi, Naoe and Yasuke lead the charge against Yamazaki Castle and eventually throw Akechi from the keep. Akechi flees on horseback, but Yasuke is able to keep up pace. He is eventually rundown in a small village down the river. Yasuke takes his revenge and cuts down Akechi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real history plays out nearly the same way. Toyotomi attacks Yamazaki Castle and Akechi flees later to be killed in a village nearby by farmers wanting to collect a bounty set by Toyotomi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 3 - Assassin's Creed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching story of Assassin's Creed is the battle of assassins and templars throughout the course of human history. Templars are much like the illuminati who want to control the world and hold all the power to themselves, and the assassins are a brotherhood of warriors who aim to thwart their plans and keep the free will of history to the people. Throughout time, these events have always been centered in Europe, the genesis of most modern day societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through investigating her family's past, Naoe learns that her mother met a Spanish assassin, who was an excommunicated member of the Assassin's Creed. He followed some templars to Nagasaki. Without the help of his brotherhood, he saught to recruit local people to form a Creed of his own to battle the templars. Naoe's mother was his first apprentice and they formed the Japanese brotherhood known as the Kakushiba Ikki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their brotherhood grew, they were able to have an audience with Emperor Go-Nara about the growing threat of templars in Japan. The emperor entrusted them with protecting the Imperial Regalia, 3 historical artifacts of extreme cultural significance (macguffins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Spanish assassin left Japan for some reason, and Naoe's mother continued leading the guild. The templars eventually found their guild. They attacked, killed all members of the guild (almost), and stole the regalia. In reality, Naoe's mother survived the attack and kept one of the artifacts, the jewel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Way back in the opening of the game, this is why the Shinbakufu singled out Naoe and her father. Her father carried this box. By killing Akechi, you were finally able to retrieve this box and learn of its importance. You return in back to its sacred vault underground with another one of the regalia that Hattori Hanzo was able to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin is Yasuke. Yasuke came to Japan as a slave on a boat run by Duarte de Melo and Nuno Caro, both members of the Portuguese templar order. They find Yasuke (whose original name is Diogo) and his mother in their quarters trying to clean some papers that fell on the floor. In typical evil villain fashion, they bring them out on the deck to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shoot Yasuke's mother in the head and turn to him next. But, from above, an assassin appears and a fight ensues. Yasuke is kicked overboard away from danger. This is how he recognized the hidden palm blade held by Naoe. He knows that the assassins fight his enemies, so that's why he wanted to join her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuke tracks down Duarte and kills him. This leads him to Nuno Caro whom he also kills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their plans in Japan were to manipulate the Shinbakufu into stealing the Imperial Regalia and claim it for themselves. Their mission as templars were to bring the regalia back to their order and use it for some plot device bullshit. Ultimately, they wanted to keep the artifacts for themselves as they thought it would help them control Japan by shaping Japanese principles and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think the entire story of Assassin's Creed has become a complete mess, you really only get this tiny kernal of its overarching story here. Shadows feels like a small side story in the universe, even though the game is far from short. (I finished with 165 hours.) I think it's neat how they found a good point in history that made sense for their European order of assassins and templars to reach Japan. And it's neat how this idea of foreign invasion through manipulation was eventually the reason Tokugawa closed to the country to all foreigners in 1602 after he gained control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its flat dialogue and characters, I felt like I had a better experience than I did with Ghosts. Ultimately, I think both games had different focuses and vibes, so it's perhaps not fair to compare them head-to-head. But, I think Shadows did a slightly better job achieving its goals than Ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really excited to play the sequel to Ghosts, though: &lt;b&gt;Ghosts of Yotei&lt;/b&gt;. After watching some minutes of people playing story sequences, the dialogue and voice acting is world's beyond anything in AC Shadows. The location is up in Hokkaido now, so having mountainous terrain and snow make sense. In the differences of elevation, you can naturally have all the variations of environment. The story doesn't focus on a brutal invasion, so I think there is room for some lighthearted elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but I think it has the opportunity to take the best things from both Ghosts of Tsuhima and Assassin's Creed Shadow to create something remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of time, I think playing through Assassin's Creed Shadows is worth it. Once you have full reign of the map, it's amazing to explore the mountains, forests, towns, and castles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games of this magnitude are so impressive that it seems almost a crime to buy it at a reduced price. I ended up getting it for $35 on ebay with a coupon. It should've included the newly released DLC, but they stiffed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before too long, there will be a sale or some kind of bundle where it can be easily got for a cheap price. I'm sure over Thanksgiving and Christmas, you can find a deal. I plan on looking for deals on the $25 DLC at that time, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Game Thoughts</category><category>Games</category><category/><category/></item></channel></rss>
