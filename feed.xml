I think the Showa period of Japan is fun to research and peruse as it contains so many building blocks that have morphed into today's capitolistic society. How were products advertised to people 60 years ago? What sort of products were people buying back then? It's interesting how something so sophisticated and advanced back then is mostly trash and garbage today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Showa Goods Museum &lt;span class='ja'&gt;昭和レトロ商品博物館&lt;/span&gt; in Ome (west west Tokyo) focuses on the commercialism of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. It's not a very big museum, like other retro museums I have visited. There's only one main room, and it was lined with displays cases that focused on different categories of products, such as stationery, toiletries, medicine, cigarettes, coca-cola, games, and sweets. The entrance had display cases with candy, soda, and cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After looking through all of the cases, I think my favorite product was a pair of upscale fancy face masks. I love the design of the man and woman on the cover of the box. In the 50s, this style was probably considered peak fashion. But now the colors have faded, the box is rotted and tore, and the mask looks like its about to fall apart. It's a real metaphor of fashion through the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their replica movie poster paintings were their most prized possessions, though. Or maybe they were restored originals? They had a recent photo that showed a man painting them. (I did not read the fine print.) These posters were incredibly vivid and striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upstairs, they had an exhibition room which focused on the Japanese folk tale, Yuki-Onna &lt;span class='ja'&gt;雪おんな&lt;/span&gt;, literally translated as Snow Woman. There were diorama displays showing each of the key scenes from the tale, various copies of books that reprinted the tale, photos of an author, and some inspired art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all Japanese folktales, including Yuki-Onna, originated hundreds of years ago, so I don't think it really fit with the Showa theme. However, it is one of more popular tales and authors in the early 1900s (before Showa) wrote the modern version of it. Maybe it was super popular in Showa times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entry for the Showa Goods Museum was only 350&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;, but you could buy a 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; combination tickets for another museum just down the block, the Showa Gentou-kan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;昭和幻燈館&lt;/span&gt;. Gentou basically means a slide as part of slide projection. The front face of the store sold headshots of many actors and actresses of the 60s and 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main part of Gentou-kan was a showcase all of this cat artwork, and the best part about the displays were the parody Kanban signs. I got photos of all sixteen of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, the shop only had one small piece of merch connected to the signs. It was the Bread Kanban Sign, but they went a step further than the original by changing &lt;span class='ja'&gt;パン&lt;/span&gt; (bread) to &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ニャン&lt;/span&gt; (meow). I probably should've bought it, but I refrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a cute museum, but it seemed far away from everything else. I don't think it'd be worth the trip on its own. But, if you were already in the area, I think the small 350&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; entry fee is an easy sell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/ome-showa-goods-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/ome-showa-goods-museum</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Japan is a country full of pockets within its dense urban centers and rural country. Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日美術館&lt;/span&gt; is such a location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudou Teruhi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日&lt;/span&gt; is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;増富中学校&lt;/span&gt; in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District &lt;span class='ja'&gt;須玉町小尾&lt;/span&gt; part of Hokuto City &lt;span class='ja'&gt;北杜市&lt;/span&gt;. When Masutomi Junior High School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;増富中学校&lt;/span&gt; was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;増富村&lt;/span&gt;. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town &lt;span class='ja'&gt;須玉町&lt;/span&gt; with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日&lt;/span&gt;. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤賢司&lt;/span&gt;, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;工藤耀日&lt;/span&gt;. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.jpg"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Entry was 1000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; and each book was 2000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/kudou-teruhi-art-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/kudou-teruhi-art-museum</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While traveling out of town, I went past the old Takane village, one of the eastern-most villages in Takayama and also one of the most remote. I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/takane" title="https://theschlock.com/takane"&gt;I visited in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and both buildings were still standing. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane" title="https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane"&gt;I visited again in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and the Junior High had been demolished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.jpg"&gt;the nearby construction sign&lt;/a&gt;, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane-in-2025</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/revisiting-takane-in-2025</link><category/><category/><category>Urban Exploration</category><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Wind Castle Shuttered</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Wind Castle in southern Toyama is perched on a short mountain covering the valley entrance to the city. From this vantage point, you could notice anyone coming down the mountain into the city. Likewise from the other direction, you have a full view of Toyama and nearly all its neighborhoods shielded by the surrounding mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first visited the Wind Castle &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle" title="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle"&gt;2 years ago&lt;/a&gt; never even knowing it had been since the 80s or 90s. Although, in reality, it's not really all that easy to see unless you know what you're looking for. The castle tower isn't really that tall and its aluminum shimmer blends into the sky and the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also not all that convenient to get to from Hwy 41 either. You either go further north than is necessary, or you take a narrow windy road straight to it. Once you arrive in Sakurayama Forest Park, it's another 450 steps up the castle trail to the peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty landmark, but it seems like it has been closed for good. Even when visiting 2 years ago, a lot of the paint was chipping away, and molding holding the thick bottled glass tiles was peeling. Now, several of the glass tiles have cracked, broke open, or broke free of their mold. The metal deck also bends under the weight of my steps. It doesn't really feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure where this extra damage came from. There were some tiles missing before, but everything still seemed safe. Perhaps the New Years earthquake of 2024 knocked a lot more of this stuff loose. There's not a lot of money to go around these days, so the city probably thought it was easier to shutter the attraction, rather than pour money into the necessary renovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, Toyama would illuminate the castle in the evening, and the controls for the illumination were inside the room on the observation deck. The leading doors were locked, but the door on the farther side had been pulled open. The wooden edge of the door has disintergrated, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4330.webp" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4330.webp"&gt;pulling itself away from the hinges&lt;/a&gt;. Another door had already been boarded shut, probably having suffered the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside was a phone, speaker amplifier, and a bunch of dials and do-dads. There were also instructions for the illumination, but I didn't look through them much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Wind Castle's best attraction is the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4341_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4260_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's the valley to the south, the city to the north, and the Tateyama mountains to the east. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had always seen these beautiful photos of the city with towering mountains in the background, but I've never been able to see them myself with such clarity. The weather always seems to change a bit in the mountains obscuring them from view. I had a rare opportunity to take some photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also true on my way to the Wind Castle coming from the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am curious about the future plans for the Wind Castle. No one is putting money into any public attractions these days, especially in rural areas. I would imagine most of that money is going into infrastrcture, repairing roads and making new tunnels. I doubt it'll ever be repaired. Also, removing it might be costly, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We shall see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/wind-castle-shuttered</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/wind-castle-shuttered</link><category/><category/><category>Urban Exploration</category><category/><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Himi Showa Hall</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Himi Showa Hall is a collection of items, tools, and daily things from the Showa Period of Japan, roughly 1926 to 1989. This period saw Japan's worst as they allied with Germany in World War II, and saw some of Japan's best as the country revitalized itself after and became one of the world's leaders in electronics in the 80s going into the 90s. Japan's aging population has fond memories of the Showa period and it is a geat example of Japan's potential in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several retro museums dotted across Japan that celebrate this period, generally titled Showa Hall. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2" title="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2"&gt;The Showa Hall in Takayama&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite touristy places where I live, and it's fun to see the building blocks connecting today's modern society to Japan's more pocketed past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Himi Showa Hall is a collection of stuff run by just one guy and his wife. It's nowhere near the scale of Takayama's Showa Hall, but it's still an impressive amount of clutter, preserved quite well.

This goes in line with the NES replica released a few years ago, and a few other attempts at nostalic video game replicas, like the Atari 2600 and the Pac-man Arcade unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was initially turned off by this announcement. I don't have a lot of nostalgia for the original Gameboy. And, while building Lego models is always fun, these larger models are expensive, take up space, and in this case, it doesn't really match the other Lego models on my shelf. It's a 60$ shelf piece, and that money would be better spent on actual video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price on the set came down leading into Black Friday. It actually does kinda fit with my botanical decour since it is another life-sized model. And Natalie the Nerd announced that she was making a conversion kit to turn the Lego model into an actual working Gameboy. Because of the Analogue Pocket, I don't need a working Gameboy, but the idea of putting it together sounds really interesting. I want to try it, even though it will be expensive and I'll never use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I bought the model. And I bought a light kit, going further away from my excuse of the cost. I also bought a few other things to make another modification on the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Build&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the Lego Gameboy is an incredible experience. So many of the components fit together sideways, backwards, and upside-down to create enough space inside the model for the buttons and D-pad to work, as well as match the near exact dimension of a real Gameboy. Various blocks also represent the PCB and other electrical internal components covered by the outer shell in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much care is put into the building experience. I think its easy to look at a Lego model and judge it based on its appearance, but there is often so much more to a Lego model. Putting it together can often show how much care the designer took in their planning and understanding of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, being able to hold the Lego Gameboy, touch the buttons, and play with it adds so much to the model. It's not as heavy as the original, and the studs on the D-pad are terrible, but after an incredible building experience, it feels like you've created something complete and workable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being to go a step further in the future to make it actually workable will bring further life to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does its best to match the dimensions and size of the original Gameboy, it still looks like Lego in the end from all the seams. Unfortunately, there's no real way to fix any of this. And really, the design team already did their best to hide as many seams as possible. This set includes several new pieces and new colored pieces to make it as lifelike as possible. If you think they should have done more, may as well just buy a replacement shell at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Buttons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the new colored pieces were used for the buttons. It is a mini-figure hat element recolored in magenta. Since I've been doing a bunch of console modding recently, I wanted to try the buttons in different colors, and there's only one other color available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Kingsley Shacklebolt from Series 2 of the Harry Potter mini-figure series. Perhaps, it is an unremarkable figure of someone I have never heard of. Was he in the main series? Or Fantastic Beasts? Anyways, the Lego Gameboy buttons are a recolored version of his hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took apart the model a little bit, and installed the blue buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks okay. They feel and operate much smoother than the magenta buttons for some reason, but the look is off. As much as I wanted to make my Lego Gameboy unique, the colors make it look like a knockoff. It kinda looks like a Watara Supervision. So, I put the magenta buttons back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Lego is being able to customize your builds however you like. Unfortunately, because so many of these pieces are unique and have unique prints on them, this is really the best you can do. You could also change the D-pad to a different color and use black start and select buttons, but I don't think any of those would improve the model. If they release a cross piece without studs, that would be an excellent upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because playing around with the buttons felt way better, when Natalie releases her conversion kit, I may end up using one or both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aliexpress had a Lego Gameboy light kit for $3! Although that price was for new members only. The actual price ended up being 1700&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. A bit expensive for a few LEDs, but I thought that I could use the light later with Natalie's LCD screen. (probably not)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kit came with some Legos to modify the stands and a few raw LEDs. It also came with no instructions. You are meant to go to YouTube and watch a video of someone putting it together. &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g" title="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g"&gt;This is the video.&lt;/a&gt; It is often difficult to see exactly what it going on because of the black pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing the screen LED is easy, though. You just open up a path along the back and stick the LED strip along the base of the screen behind the inlay. You replace the holding bar with a small pipe piece which I think holds the inlay in place much better anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can barely see the pipe's shadow in the upper right corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen LED was the whole reason I bought the kit, but I decided to put together the stand LED lights, too. Unfortunately, these tiny LEDs are very brittle. I was able to install two of them easily, but &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.jpg"&gt;I destroyed one of them&lt;/a&gt; crimping the piece the wrong way. With a very tiny pair of wire strippers, this could be fixed, but I will ignore it for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two out of three lights still allows me to create the modifications to the Gameboy's stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this light kit looks exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lego Gameboy is meant as a display piece so it makes sense to have museum style spotlights on it. The screen LED also has a consistent level orange tone that makes it look like a classic screen light, too. Either Mario and Zelda inlays look great with this mod, but I prefer Zelda. The standard Nintendo scroll doesn't look like great, in my opinion. Tetris would've been best, but getting that license would've been more difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going further, I used some leftover Lego LEDs from my bonsai trees and connected all the USB plugs together to set the Lego Gameboy among my Lego botanical collection. It works as the perfect center piece and the lights really emphasize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should get some more Lego spotlights for the rest of the scene. (No no, stop spending money.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incredible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I'm very adverse to buying more Legos because of the price, the Lego Gameboy exceeds all of my expectations. I felt such incredible joy and accomplishment putting together the model, even though it's ultimately just a display piece (for now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Lego, 60$ really isn't all that much compared to so many other overpriced sets. Even the new Japanese Bonsai sets are way too expensive. However, considering that I could spend that same 60$ (or less) on Death Stranding 2, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Ghosts of Yotei, it seems so foolish to buy this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I think its an incredible model that was a joy to build, looks authentic, and could become more special in the future thanks to Natalie the Nerd. If you're into video game collectibles, especially Nintendo, I think it's worth a purchase even if you don't care too much about the Gameboy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category>Toys</category><category>Media</category></item><item><title>Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining event returns this year with a new theme, The Story of Trees through the Ages. &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;時代（とき）をめぐる木と樹の物語&lt;/span&gt; is the full title of the event. Last year's theme focused on Kanamori Nagachika and various locations that were impacted by him. This year, the focus was on trees!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several millenia old trees in Takayama, but Takayama also has a rich history in carpentry and craftsmanship in wood arts. After the area was taken over by Kanamori in the late 1500s, he recognized the unique carpentry skills of the residents and cultivated their ability. Many of the resulting woodwork would be used for buildings throughout Gifu, Nagoya, and Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like last year, the event was hosted at the Takayama City Museum and also just like last year, it was advertised very little. I think the posters at the entrance of the museum were the only indication it was happening. Once again, I didn't hear about it until a local friend sent me a message. Here's the link for information: &lt;a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/"&gt;https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my third photo rogaining event. I joined &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining"&gt;last year's Takayama Rogaining event&lt;/a&gt; as my first. Prior, I had never heard of this kind of event before. The etymology of Rogaining comes from the three people who coined the term, Roy, Gail, and Neil, and they first began using the term in the 70s. However, Photo Rogaining isn't all that different from Orienteering which dates back to 1897.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it's like a marathon, but you create your own path. 20 or 30 minutes prior to the start of the race, runners or teams of runners are given a map and a list of checkpoints. Runners have no knowledge of this leading up to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here were the map and list of checkpoints for this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each checkpoint has a different point value. For each checkpoint you visit, that point value is added to your total. The team or runner with the highest point value wins. Photo Rogaining goes one step further by requiring runner to take photos of the target at each checkpoint. You are meant to recreate the photos listed on the checkpoint sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Orienteering or Rogaining event has a strict time limit, so you must reach the finish line within the time limit while collecting as many checkpoints as possible. The Takayama Photo Rogaining event has a limit of 3 hours. You are deducted 30 points each minute you are late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus (or headache), the Takayama Rogaining event adds some extra bonus points. Last year, you could gain an extra bonus point for every photo you took of Kanamori Nagachika's name written out on a sign for a total of 20 bonus points. I didn't quite understand this last year, so I ignored it. Ultimately I lost 2nd place by 4 points. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's bonus points were much more cryptic and numerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1 were the normal &lt;span class='ja'&gt;通常&lt;/span&gt; bonus points. At four of the checkpoints (numbers 1, 17, 25, 47), if you took an additional photo matching the ones posted, you could get an extra 5 points each. This was very clear and easy to understand. Find the stuff, and take a photo. Got it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2 were the secret &lt;span class='ja'&gt;秘密&lt;/span&gt; bonus points. There were 3 different collections of locations that each followed the theme posted on the board. If you went to each of the locations that matched the theme, you would be awarded either 40 or 30 bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three themes were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Theme 3 - 40 points - 1000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時を見てきた長生きの木&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme 2 - 30 points - 400&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時をつなぐ&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class='ja'&gt;人の飛騨の匠&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme 1 - 30 points - 100&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a glance, I just noticed 1000-year-old trees, 400-year-old takumi, and 100-year-old carpenters. At the time, I thought, Yeah, I could correctly translate these to understand them completely. However, I would have no idea which locations would match these descriptions. So, I choose to not focus on them and hope my path would collect these locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the time came, we were able to open our maps and start plotting our courses. Having done these events twice now, I have learned that you want to make big swings towards the distant areas first, and clean up the points near the finish at the end. If you spend too much time getting all the near points at the beginning, you may not have enough time to get the high valued places further out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's far out locations were nearly the same as last year's. So my plan was to grab a few near checkpoints while heading further west to Hida no Sato and the Shingu neighborhood. From Shingu, head directly north to the Kumano Shrine, which &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter" title="https://theschlock.com/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter"&gt;I visited back in February&lt;/a&gt;. And then head back downtown to grab any more points I could before the finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan was also to not get any checkpoints that required backtracking unless I had the time for it and they were high value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Noon, the bell was rung and the museum bay doors were open allowing everyone to spill out into the street and start running in their directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately went to the 3 checkpoints clustered together at Nakabashi. First was point 3, the Sakura tree next to the bridge, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山市基準木のサクラ&lt;/span&gt;. On the other side of the bridge was point 6, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;木鶴大明神像&lt;/span&gt;, the statue of Mokkaku Daimei. Going back over the bridge again was point 5, a weeping willow tree, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山市保存樹のシダレヤナギ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 → 6 → 5 // (14 points) // 12:04pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a quick 14 starter points. Point 6 required a little backtracking, but no more than a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued south along the river to get Point 7, a Sugi tree in front of a shrine, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山神明神社のスギ&lt;/span&gt;. From Point 7, I had two options: go south for Point 16 or go west to Points 10 and 14. 24 is greater than 16 and it was the quicker path for further going west. My plan was to go for the big swings rather than clean up every checkpoint. (Ultimately, this was a mistake.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found Point 10, another shrine's sugi tree, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;一本杉白山神社の先立スギ&lt;/span&gt; and then Point 14, a small ume tree next to another shrine, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨天満宮のウメ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0892_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0896_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0899_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 → 10 → 14 // (+31 points / 45 total) // 12:16pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I was doing pretty good so far. That's quite a few points in a short time. Although, these events are marathons. It doesn't matter how fast you can grab points if you run out of energy. You need to keep going and continue grabbing more and more points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hida Sangyo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨産業&lt;/span&gt; (Point 17) was right next to Tenman Shrine (Point 14), so I quickly grabbed that photo. Point 17 was my first checkpoint with a bonus point. I needed to run inside and find the set of chairs. I thought they would be right by the entrance, but they were not. I ran through the ground floor and found nothing. After asking the receptionist, the photo was located in the back area on the second floor. Bleh.. waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0903.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0903.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0903_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0903_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0903_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0906.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0906.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0906_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0906_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0906_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17 → 5 bonus // (+22 points / 67 total) // 12:21pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the points in the Tenman Shrine area, I went directly west to starting collecting points in the Matsukura area. This is where actually training for the event would've been helpful. Run, walk, run, walk. If I would've done a lot more running, I could've covered the distance much faster, which would've helped in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 23, 24, 25 were all next to each other, and Point 25 had a bonus point. I first grabbed a photo of Point 23, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;友好の丘&lt;/span&gt;, the hill of friendship. Then went off the main road to Point 24, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;旧野首家&lt;/span&gt;, the former Nokubi house. On the hill behind the house was a small museum of mountain tools, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山岳資料館&lt;/span&gt;, Point 25. And, just inside the door, was the ice pick for 5 bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0908_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0912_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0917_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0921_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 → 24 → 25 → 5 bonus // (+77 points / 144 total) // 12:39pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was slowing down, but I thought that I was still on a good pace, despite the time wasted at Hida Sangyo. Point 28 was nearby, but continuing up the hill to grab Points 26 and 27 were more lucrative. I thought that backtracking to Point 28 after would cost too much time. (Ultimately, this skip was fine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point 26 was an easy find being next to the road. It was the entrance to another wooden furniture showroom, the Hida Mokuyuu-kan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨木遊館&lt;/span&gt;.  Point 27 was much more difficult to locate. It was one of seven 5 meter wooden statues in the "forest of good fortune," &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨開運乃森&lt;/span&gt;. I had never seen this place before, so I climbed in the backway, not realizing I was looking for the statue in front of the entrance. Another 5 minutes wasted and some energy wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0928_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0944_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 → 27 // (+53 points / 197 total) // 12:52pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next plan was to head further west and grab all the Shingu points. There were 3 locations worth 40 points each!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still able to keep moving and keep pace with time, but I was doing more walking than running. I started eating some of the chocolates we were given at the start. I also drank all of my water. I made a quick pick stop at Lawson to get another water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it to Point 40 labeled as "a large tree near Harayama park" &lt;span class='ja'&gt;原山公園近くの大樹&lt;/span&gt; in 20 minutes. It wasn't hard to find, but I was slowing down. I went north from the tree to visit two craftsmanship workshops, Point 41 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小坂彫房&lt;/span&gt; Kosaka Woodcrafts and Point 42 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;川上憲一氏工房&lt;/span&gt; Kawakami Woodworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both woodworking locations were a little awkward as the photos meant encrouching into their businesses. You stood in front of the main window of Kosaka Woodcrafts and took photos while they worked. At Kawakami, there was a guy waiting for you. He escorted me into the workshop to take the photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0955_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0959_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;40 → 41 → 42 // (+123 points / 320 total) // 1:23pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, my main goal was to grab the northwestern-most points at Kumano shrine. Point 43 was nearby, but I was worried about time. The race was about half complete, and I assumed that it would take me an hour to go from Kumano Shrine to the finish. I wasn't even sure I could get all those points in 30 minutes. I decided that it required too much backtracking for the points to be worth it. (Ultimately, this wasn't that big a mistake, but it was still 43 points.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept pushing forward to Kumano Shrine, even though my legs were starting to hit their limit. I went past my school and the surrounding businesses. I went across the bridge and cut across the rice fields. And I arrived at Point 55, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;熊野神社のスギ&lt;/span&gt;, the Sugi trees at the entrance of Kumano Shrine, at 1:47pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Mr. Shimizu (who won first place last year, and this year too) arrived. From there, the next point was 47, the ancient hut at Akahogi Park &lt;span class='ja'&gt;風土記の丘&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;復元住居広場&lt;/span&gt;. Shimizu used the windy clear paths going up the hill to the park, but I terminatored my way through brush and thicket taking the straightest path to the hut. We arrived at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having visited the hut earlier in the year, I knew exactly where the bonus point was. I went inside and snapped the photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0966_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0970_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0973_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0978_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 → 47 → 5 bonus → 46 // (+153 points / 473 total) // 1:54pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to keep pace with Shimizu as we both got Point 46 at the same time heading back down the hill. Point 46 was a pile of charcoal and firewood &lt;span class='ja'&gt;活エネの炭焼き窯と薪&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, after that, my legs were done. This was the end of my big swings, and now I had to get back to the finish line before 3pm. I had one hour which was totally doable under nomal situations. Shimizu said he was running off to Sky Park, but there was no way I could get there. I kept moving quickly, but all of my remaining points would be small deviations from my straight path to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map, I decided to head towards Takayama Station to grab Point 13 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山駅連絡通路の&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;屋台展示&lt;/span&gt;. There was a replica wooden festival float inside. I still had some time, so I went a little north to get a photo of the 1000 year old ginko tree at Kokubunji, Point 11 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;騨国分寺の大イチョウ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0982_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0986_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 → 11 // (+24 points / 497 total) // 2:36pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, I saw some teams run north to grab Points 9 and 8. These points felt undoable in my situation, and I wanted to get closer to the finish line. So, I ignored them. (Ultimately, this was a big mistake.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went west to the finish line, and arrived with 15 minutes left. I quickly moved up the hill and got Point 2 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ミネルヴァのフクロウ&lt;/span&gt;, the wooden owl in front of the library. Then with my final push, I grabbed Point 1 at the finish line, the Yajima Storehouse &lt;span class='ja'&gt;矢嶋家塩蔵&lt;/span&gt;. Then I wasted time trying to find the bonus point, which was right inside the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0989_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0993_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0996_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 → 1 → 5 bonus // (+8 points / 505 total) // 2:56pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having got that final bonus point, I went across the finish line and completed the race in 2 hours 57 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0999_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I had done pretty well. I visited more locations compared with last year. My point total was lower, but the maximum point total was also lower. On average, my score was higher than last year! However, the bonus points killed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there were three themes, and now I actually translated them:&lt;br/&gt;Theme 3 - 40 points - &lt;b&gt;1000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時を見てきた長生きの木&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (1000-year-old trees)&lt;br/&gt;Theme 2 - 30 points - &lt;b&gt;400&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の時をつなぐ&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class='ja'&gt;人の飛騨の匠&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (400-year-old Hida carpenters)&lt;br/&gt;Theme 1 - 30 points - &lt;b&gt;100&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(100-year-old Hida Businesses supporting area carpenters.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now at the end, these locations had been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1008_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 10, 11, and 16 contained the 1000-year-old trees. Very early in the race, I intentionally skipped Point 16 because I thought it was too far out of the way. Given everywhere else I went, this was a 56-point loss. Although, I may have skipped Point 10 if I went to 16 instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 8, 9, 41, 42 were the 400-year-old carpenters. I made the big swing to grab Points 41 and 42, but with so little energy left at the end and not so much time, I did not go the extra distance out of my way to get Points 8 and 9. If I had known these would've boosted my score an extra 30 points, I would've skipped Takayama Station and the Library. This was basically a 34-point loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 17, 28, 49 were the 100-year-old companies. This one was a wash anyways. I had only gotten Point 17. I could've done a little backtracking for Point 28 near Hida-no-Sato. But I had never considered going after Point 49. It was too far north. Technically, no real point loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had I actually done training for the event and had better knowledge of these bonus points, my score could've easily been more than 100 points higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shimizu got first place again this year by visiting nearly all checkpoints on the map. He only skipped four points. He skipped Point 49, which was too far north, losing him 30 bonus points. He also missed a 5-point bonus photo somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standings were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1st Place - 768 points&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place - 747 points&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - 693 points&lt;br/&gt;4th Place - 603 points&lt;br/&gt;5th Place - 557 points&lt;br/&gt;6th Place - 510 points&lt;br/&gt;7th Place - 505 points &lt;--- It's me!&lt;br/&gt;8th Place - 481 points&lt;br/&gt;9th Place - 423 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I ended at 7th place out of 9 people in my division. Not Last! Also, our division was the most competitive, so my score was pretty close the top places in the group and family divisions. 100 points would have boosted me to 4th place, but I would have absolutely not made the Top 3 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had a lot of extra prizes, so I was able to win something anyways. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I love running these Photo Rogaining events, but I always feel disappointed in the end. It's like the opposite feeling after completing a marathon. In both cases, poor training can result in poor times, but for Rogaining, there's always the worry of whether or not you are following the optimal path for your ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was only able to do two Rogaining events this year. I signed up for a third, but it was held only two days after this Takayama event. My legs were ruined the whole weekend, so it was impossible for me to join. I spent the rest of the weekend building that Lego Gameboy. (They sent me a map, though, so I could mentally practice.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll try to do more next year! Maybe this time I will have the proper motivation to train for them. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025</link><category/><category/><category>Running</category><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category/></item><item><title>Analogue Pocket Button Replacement</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Analogue Pocket is one of my favorite pieces of video game hardware ever. Decades of video game history have never looked, sounded, and felt better when played on this beautiful device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Analogue Pocket lends itself well to people wanting to customize their gaming experience both inside and outside of the platform. One of the first mods people did with their Pockets was a button swap. After the release of the Pocket and the opening of its FPGA, popularity exploded and many Etsy sellers got to work making their own buttons. I bought two different sets of replacement buttons back in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set was from a seller on eBay who no longer exists. This was recommended by a user on the FPGA discord. The buttons followed the convex concave pattern of an SNES controller, but are made from soft resin. The D-pad is ever so slightly enlarged to prevent wiggling in the Pocket's shell. Because of this, the D-pad and buttons felt so much better than the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second set was from an Etsy store called Cloud Life, which also no longer exists. This store had a lot of different colors available, but I wanted something subtle, yet different. I didn't want any flashy gaudy colors as that would take away from the Pocket's sleek aesthetics. They also accepted custom orders, so I decided to use the Black button set as a base and add two transparent buttons for Y and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting everything in Winter 2023 during a trip back to America, I finally did a button swap using the Cloud Life set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buttons looked really nice, but there were problems in other areas. First, the menu buttons had the wrong grooves. They sent two right buttons, instead of a right and left. Also, the bottom nub on the D-pad was flat, not rounded. This meant that it would usually not register rolling movements on the D-pad. If I pressed down, then right, it would stay down. So, I only did the button replacement, shown above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;NES D-pad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone else on the FPGA discord mentioned something interesting. Apparently the NES D-pad on those Nintendo replica Controller Capsule toys is an exact fit for the Analogue pocket. I bought &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set" title="https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set"&gt;a bunch of these last year&lt;/a&gt; when they released the second series focusing on Super Nintendo, Gamecube, and N64. I didn't care about the NES and Famicom ones, but I wanted to give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Auctions had a cheap enough one. It can easily be taken apart with a Phillips head screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user claimed that this D-pad felt so good when playing games. It also fixed his unfortunate problem of triggering false diagonals, a common problem among some Pocket owners. I never had this problem with my Pocket. My only problem was using that Cloud Life replacement D-pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at each of these D-pad, you can see where these problems could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grey D-pad is a near exact resin mold of the original D-pad. The nub in the middle is rounded, allowing for smooth diagonal movements. The stock D-pad had the same shape. The Cloud Life D-pad on the far right also has this nub, but it is not rounded. This does not allow for smooth diagonal movements, which causes some directions to become locked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NES D-pad looks like the best for rounded movements. It uses a stiff plastic post with a rounded ball in the middle. There are no grooves at all for diagonal movements to get stuck. This is why the NES D-pad felt the better than the stock D-pad for that user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I got to work tearing down my Pocket to install the NES D-pad as its nub's shape was clearly the best out of all my options. There's a great guide on ifixit showing &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396" title="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396"&gt;full teardown and button replacement&lt;/a&gt; that I always refer to when opening my Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main tool you'll need a T6 screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only five screws you'll need to remove. Four of them are immediately on the back panel of the Pocket, which is the first step of the teardown. You remove those screws and the back panel comes loose. This reveals the battery pack. Unplug the battery, and then remove it from the tabs on the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a Gen 1 first release Pocket. Later models have slightly different batteries, but the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going further, we need to remove the PCB for the shoulder button contacts. There's a tiny plastic tab holding it in place. Pull that back with some tweezers and the board should come loose. Next, we want to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.jpg"&gt;remove the ribbon cable&lt;/a&gt;. Just pop open the gate, and the ribbon can be pulled out. (This is annoying to put back in later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the back panel is only clipped into place. To remove it, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.jpg"&gt;slightly lift the bottom end of it&lt;/a&gt;, and then slide it down. The clips will let go of it, and you can remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the back of the Pocket's main PCB. There are four points of contact now. The cables going to the top two speakers must be unplugged. Just open those gates, and pull out the cables. There's another cable going to the power button. Open that gate, and remove the cable. And, the final screw in the middle, which holds the PCB to the front shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCB can be lifted from the shell, but there is still a cable from PCB to the front screen. The ifixit instructions say to remove the plug to completely detach the front shell, but I am too nervous to do this step. It's probably completely safe, but I'm too worried about damage. I can reach the buttons easily without having to unplug it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remove my D-pad and put in the NES D-pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I don't like how it looks. The plastic sheen of the NES D-pad doesn't match the matte finish of the Pocket, nor the softness of the Cloud Life buttons. It looks really out of place. Also, the arrows on the D-pad also don't match the Pocket's aesthetics. It's too busy compared with the subtleness of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main purpose of doing a button replacement is for the presentation. All of the stock components already felt amazing and played great, so I didn't need to do anything if I only cared about usage. Also, the NES D-pad is slightly smaller than the original one. So, it wiggled around even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user on the FPGA discord was using the D-pad on a White Pocket, so the aesthetics are a bit different. On the Black Pocket, it's too easy to compare black to black and see that things are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloud Life D-Pad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the aesthetics of the Cloud Life D-pad the best, but its square nub prevented the movements. Well...  what if I used a nail file to round it out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material they used for these buttons melted away almost immediately, and I could create the rounded movement that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's more square than the original D-pad, but it fits the aesthetics and matches the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material that they used for these buttons is weirdly refractive. Depending on how the light enters the button, the weave of the material either brightens or darkens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this with the X and A buttons on the side. The weave of the X button is horizontal, while the weave of the A button is vertical. With the direction that I installed the D-pad, too much light is reflected. I need to open it up again and change the rotation to make it perfect. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buttons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Pocket-mania has really died down. Developers are still putting out some Arcade cores, but Analogue has been focusing their efforts on their Nintendo 64, and not really given much time to the Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do occasionally play the Pocket from time to time. I'll run through a game of Dr. Mario, and see how far I can get in Gradius III or Outrun. Sometimes I'll devote a little time for a good run in Tetris Rosy Retrospective, too. Maybe someday, I'll try to get all the way through Snatcher on Turbo CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having the boring Black version of the Pocket, I really love how it looks, how it plays, and how it feels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-button-replacement</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-button-replacement</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Juunigatake in Autum 十二ヶ岳</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Over 10 years ago, I hiked Junnigatake and was able to see the entirety of Nyukawa and the surrounding mountains in Takayama. For quite a while, I have wanted to hike the mountain again for some updated photos. I remember it being a really easy hike, so I finally pulled the cord and went back on a beautiful and clear mid-November day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hike was almost exactly the same as it was back when I first arrived in Takayama. Here's &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/juunigatake" title="https://theschlock.com/juunigatake"&gt;my post from 11 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. After turning from the entrance, the old abandoned bus was still in its same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0255_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6139.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing both photos, a lot more garbage had been added to it. Looking through the current garbage inside, there were multiple old CRT tvs and an old computer tower with nothing inside. There was lots of old stero equipment and some office chairs. Maybe all this stuff was inside the bus before, and someone had fished it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0264_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_6132.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing up the road, the pavement became dirt and I arrived at the familiar crossroads. Taking a left continued up the mountain, and taking a right continued along the edge of the mountain going to some unknown destination. I wonder if there are any abandoned homes or buildings that way. (Actually, the road probably just ends.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went with left path and ascended reaching a road block after 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few meters down the road, a landslide had covered some of the path. I probably could have driven around or over it, but the real risk is the current part of the road collapsing. According to my notes, the trailhead for the mountain wasn't too far away, so I parked my car and grabbed my camera. I grabbed a bear bell for protection, too. (Although, if a bear showed up, it's not going to care that I have a bell.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail entrance wasn't too far away. It was around just a few bends of the mountain road. On the edge of one of the bends, was a small, yet clear sign indicating the entrance of the trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail left the dirt road and went up into the trees. The trail was completely covered in leaves, but there was a clear break in the trees and twigs which guided me further up and down the side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About halfway up the trail, it became completely covered in overgrown brush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From above, it seemed like there was no organization. Once you entered the brush, each direction looked the same. The brush was about as tall as I was, so I had to crouch walk to keep place with the trail. Even though it felt like I was just plowing through with no direction, the faint spacing of a trail was legitimate, and it lead me to the summit's base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0389_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a shrine gate at the base of the summit leading to a steeper ascent, but with stairs this time. The stairs go directly to the summit and observation point. But, there is a less steep option going to the right and circling the summit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the summit, you can see all of Nyukawa, the immediate north-eastern neighborhood of Takayama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although today, I really couldn't see much of anything. The sun was setting directly in my eyes and a lot of water vapor was collecting in the air readying for the rain fall that would happen in the next 2 hours. I took my photos, but even looking at them now, it's hard to exactly pinpoint certain locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My photos from 11 years ago were far clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5946_stitch.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can actually see Takayama in the above photo from 11 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had much more success with photos going to the east than west. Both Mt. Norikura, Shinhotaka, and Yarigadake were in clear view. And with the sun pointing directly at them, they were clearly lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0493_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0505_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's so much easier taking photos of a subject with the lights on them rather than the lights on you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that I wasn't able to get great photos of Nyukawa and Takayama from the summit. Maybe I will try again in the winter. It's really not a difficult hike if you can drive most of the way. Also, there might be an easier way to get to the summit than using my path detailed below. There's a side road located at 36°12'03.1"N 137°21'34.6"E that is a much flatter path, and it might be near the same distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a fun quick hike that I could execute after a half-day of work, and I can feel accomplished that I did a minimal amount of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timeline of Hike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:30pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Juunigatake Road Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556"&gt;N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:48pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crossroad to Juunigatake&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444"&gt;N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1:56pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Road Closure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723"&gt;36°11'33.6"N 137°23'19.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:07pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trail Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889"&gt;N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:18pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Top of Ascent&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778"&gt;N36° 11' 47.22", E137° 23' 5.56"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:26pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Summit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722"&gt;N36° 11' 49.74", E137° 23' 11.66"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:40pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Eastern Summit &lt;span class='ja'&gt;十二ヶ岳&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;東峰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111"&gt;N36° 11' 48.31", E137° 23' 16.48"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:50pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trail Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889"&gt;N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2:57pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Car&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1926609,137.3886723"&gt;36°11'33.6"N 137°23'19.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3:02pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Crossroad to Juunigatake&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444"&gt;N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3:12pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Juunigatake Road Entrance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556"&gt;N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/juunigatake-in-autum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/juunigatake-in-autum</link><category/><category>Mountains</category><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category><category/></item><item><title>8bitdo Pro 3 Controller and Shiny Hunts</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought yet another retro controller. The Pro3 is 8BitDo's latest revision of one of their most popular controller, the SN30, which was based on the Super Nintendo controller. It comes in a few different colors, half of which are based on the Gamecube. I decided on going with the mid to dark gray tone of the original Playstation because I think this looked best when paired with the Super Famicom buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Pro3's roots are in the retro space, it is very much a modern controller. I think it's interesting how third-party controllers used to be cheap knock-offs, but in the last 5 or 10 years, many gaming peripheral companies are creating controllers that can do more and work better than first-party controllers. They use more precise components that don't degrade over time and still sell them for cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Switch is the best example of this. Switch Joy-Cons are now infamous for developing "drift," sending unintended movements when you're trying to play. Switch Pro controllers also can develop drift, as well as Xbox and Playstation controllers. Modern premium third-party controllers use "hall-effect" style sticks that prevent this drift from happening, including the Pro3 controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's also interesting how the evolution of 8BitDo's Pro series somewhat mirrors their own development as a company. 8BitDo began as a company selling NES and SNES controllers that worked on original hardware and modern PCs. The SN30 was released in 2018 and the SN30 Pro came a year later, which added the twin sticks. In 2021, they released the Pro2 which aimed to make the controller more modern with ergonomic handles and programmable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their controllers became more and more modern, 8BitDo was expanding their focus from retro only to all modern platforms. In 2022, they released the Ultimate 1, their first controller that primarily targetted modern gaming. Now in 2025, they have brought all the features of their Ultimate controller series back to the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I did not care about the Pro3. While I love the Super Nintendo, it's flat-face design puts too much emphasis on nostalgia instead of ergonomics and comfortability. I think the Playstation 5's Dual Sense is the most comfortable controller I've ever used. It fits in my hand perfectly, and all the buttons are close enough and in exact positions that I only have to move my thumb to press something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting the Pro3, it does feel big and combersome. When I'm gripping the controller and focused on using the sticks for movement, my hands are too down the handle that I need to move them to hit UP or the Y-button. And I really need to move my hand to hit the Start and Select button in the middle. Sure, that's their nostalgic position in the middle, but having those buttons in the corner of the D-pad and the button array is their modern, more convenient position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe they should've made some considerations to sacrifice nostalgia. Although, after using it nearly a whole day playing Pokemon on Switch, I didn't have any problems, so maybe my brain is too wired on the Dual Sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 comes with a charging dock and USB-C cable. The charging dock doubles as a wireless receiver as hidden in the base of the dock is a USB-C 2.4ghz dongle. You can remove this dongle and use it on a Mac or Windows or plug this directly into the Switch 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also hidden in the dock are replacement buttons. The face buttons on the Pro3 are held in place by magnets. You can remove these buttons using the plunger tool and mix-n-max the buttons in any order you want. You can keep the buttons to match the Switch B-A layout, or flip them to fit Windows' A-B layout. You can also replace them with the rainbow buttons matching the Super Famicom layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do like the Pro3 and it is a strict upgrade from using the Dual Shock 4, which I had been using on the Switch and other consoles prior. I like the Dual Shock 4 a lot, but mine is a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller" title="https://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller"&gt;custom repair job&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago. It feels rickety from the repair and once or twice the buttons don't work without a power cycle. It is also limited by its bluetooth connection, which requires a USB dongle for the switch. (I'm using the 8BitDo retro receiver.) And also the giant touch pad in the middle acts as the screenshot button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 feels solid and incredibly well made. Using bluetooth, it connects to the Switch natively without the need of a USB receiver, so it even works in handheld mode. You can go a step further and use the included 2.4ghz receiver, which gives a connection that makes the controller feel just as responsive as a wired connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 has now become my universal controller used on Switch, Mister, and other consoles with Bluetooth options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A Shiny Hunts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think having many extra buttons and back paddles on a controller is unnecessary, the biggest boon of the Pro3 is being able to program these buttons to perform macros. And this is particularly helpful with the most recent Pokemon game, Legends Z-A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all Pokemon games, you encounter, catch, and train Pokemon to be the best. However, when they spawn, every Pokemon has a base 1/4096 chance of becoming Shiny, an alternate colored version. These are highly sought after because of their rarity, even though they occasionally look terrible. In recent games, there have been methods which increase your chances of a shiny either through increased odds or increased spawns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legends Z-A has a different method through permanence. As you walk around Luminose City, Pokemon spawn and despawn from a 50m radius around your character. However, if a Pokemon spawns as a shiny, it will stay in memory. Even if it despawns, when it comes into view again, it will be shiny. This means that if your character is running around the world, it is constantly shiny checking Pokemon that will not disappear on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perfect for the Pro3 because you can program infinitely repeating movements for your character as a macro, let the macro run by itself, and come back to the games hours later to find tons of shiny Pokemon (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macros and Mac Problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To set macros on the Pro3, you must use 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2. This software is available on ios, macos, pc, and android. You also use this software to update the firmware on the controller and dongle. On Mac, the current version is v1.0.8, but when you update the firmware on the dongle, the dongle becomes stuck in boot mode, so the controller cannot connect to it. (The problem doesn't happen on Windows.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent an email to 8BitDo's support and they replied with an updated version of the software for Mac. Version 1.0.8 is from Sept 2025, but this one has a date of Oct 2025. Maybe it's a prerelease version of 1.0.9? Anyways, here's a link if you happen to need it: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs/ 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 for mac adapter boot.zip&lt;/a&gt;. Using this new version fixes my dongle's boot problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the controller is connected either through the dongle or a wired USB-C connection, you can click into its Switch settings and create a profile. Profiles can be switched on the fly, so you can set up 4 macros on one profile, and switch to another profile with another 4 macros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Mac, macros are built using controller inputs and refined after. You can't build them by scratch, which I think is possible on Windows. But, it's easier to just record input and mess with them after. Once a macro is built, it must be assigned to one of the 4 extra buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Froakie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Froakie, I used the following macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froakie spawns in the middle of Wild Zone 16, which is unlocked after reaching Rank C in the story. This macro is meant to be started after entering Wild Zone 5, though, which is right next to it. After entering Wild Zone 5 from the south, you can fast travel to Wild Zone 5 which puts you right in front of the entrance you just entered. Fast traveling like this rerolls and respawns all Pokemon, so putting this on an infinite loop will do a Froakie check every 20 seconds. It will reroll all surrounding Pokemon, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI, these timers are based on Switch 1 load times. Switch 2 would be faster, so you could tweak the times to be more efficient. It's pretty efficient on my Switch 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After setting this up, I sat in my bathtub for about 2 hours. When I returned, I already had a shiny Froakie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greninja is an excellent Shiny, plus it has a new Mega evolution. I thought he would be perfect for my team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Litwick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandelure is another strong Pokemon whom also has a new Mega evolution. I'm not a fan of its Shiny, but rare is rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litwick spawns in only three locations, two of which are near each other and all of which are in the sewers. You first visit these sewers right before reaching Rank C in the story. After that story sequence, they are closed off, but can be opened again through a side mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For shiny checks, we want to run down the hallway leading to the Litwicks. After they spawn, we want to run back to the beginning of the hallway. Rinse and repeat to infinite. Here's my macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was adapted from &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtvvjHf6XjoNOOor79sGWcAb-7cODfC4MxtP7dGHp2c/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABmop9o64*PyMj49AE9321GW2IhVd7fA#gid=1954077779" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtvvjHf6XjoNOOor79sGWcAb-7cODfC4MxtP7dGHp2c/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABmop9o64*PyMj49AE9321GW2IhVd7fA#gid=1954077779"&gt;PhillyBeatzU's Youtube Community&lt;/a&gt;. Each one of these I have had to tweak in some small way, so if you use any of these yourself, you might have to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This macro I left running all day while I went to work. I figured that I would return home to either my game being turned off because things went to sleep or ran out of batteries, or my character was stuck on the wall. Neither were the case, and I had two shiny Litwicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ralts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralts ultimately evolves into Gardevoir and Gallade. Psychic and Fairy moves have been very helpful in Pokemon Z-A so far, so I thought Gardevoir would be a good addition to my team. Gallade is a great Pokemon when catching other because it knows Hypnosis and False Swipe. False Swipe isn't in Z-A, so I'm not sure if Gallade is actually useful, but it's Psychic and Fighting might be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, two Ralts spawn in the overworld in the northwest in a grassy alcove of buildings. When you go in the area, there's a ladder that brings to the roof, right next to a bench. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a bench, you can progress time from day to night and night to day. This respawns all Pokemon just like fast traveling, but you don't have to worry about the day-night cycle. Choose the bench closest to the ladder, and use the following macro:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This macro was again adopted for PhillyBeatzU. It just holds down and hits the A button a bunch. There's a B button thrown in there in case it accidentally chooses to relax with Pokemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left this going all day while I was at work and came back to nothing on the first day. Although, there was a shiny Dedenne and Flabebe on other roofs nearby. The next day, I left it going again and I came back to TWO shiny Ralts. There was an Eevee on a nearby roof, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both Ralts had Adament natures, which is bad for Gardevoir, so the search continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Pokemon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm working on building my shiny team for the game's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next target is Delphox which has been instrumental in many of my fights. Chandelure and Gardevoir might replace its duties, but it's not a bad idea to have some redundancies. I need to progress to the story to Rank B to unlock the Wild Area that has Fennekin, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground is another very useful type in Pokemon Z-A and Mega Garchomp is going to be the best Ground type. Hunting that one is very annoying, though, as it only has a 10% chance of spawning in its area. Apparently, you can do some spawn manipulation to get them spawning 100% of the time. I might take the time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my team would be Greninja, Gardevoir, Gallade, Delphox, Garchomp, and Chandelure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...  I don't really have any good defense against Fairy and Water. I need steel and grass moves. I guess I should go after Beldum when I reach that point in the story. For Grass, having a shiny Meganium would be best, but those won't be available until after the story is complete. I think Gallade might have a good Grass move...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiny Hunting has been lucrative, but the passive brute force nature of it is not very engaging like it was in Legends Arceus or Pokemon Violet. Also, there is very little variety in the city and the low rez nature of the game makes it quite boring when compared with the open world games I've gone through this year on PS5. Katamari has more variety than this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I cannot find myself caring about this story. It's neat to see old characters from Pokemon X/Y come back, but the story wasn't all that great back then either, so I don't remember it at all. The last Pokemon story that I actually remember was Pokemon Black/White where the villains thought the idea of "enslaving" Pokemon in balls was cruel, which was an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of voice acting in Pokemon is really becoming apparent now, too. Every cutscene is endless textboxes with uninspired music in the background. It's sometimes hard to stay awake, let alone pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of the game is its new take on the battle system making it more of an arena fighter rather than a turn-by-turn RPG fighter. In my opinion, the most boring part of Pokemon has been fighting. It takes forever, and it's always just a means to an end. While not perfect, this arena-style battling is fresh and pretty fun. I would love to see this refined in future titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I think that is the game's only good point. Good = Battling. Bad = Graphics, Art, Music, Story, Characters, Exploration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'll continue playing much after completing the story and completing the Pokedex. I don't think I will go deep with Shiny hunting the way I had with other titles. I think I'll probably move on to another game or buy that Assassin's Creed DLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts</link><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/><category>Pokemon</category></item><item><title>MemCard Pro for Gamecube</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Memory cards for video game consoles in the late 90s through 2000s were an absolute necessity as disc-based media replaced traditional cartridges. Consoles didn't have internal storage, so these cards held all your saves. It was great for moving your saves around to a friend's house or using multiple game consoles, but if you played a lot of games, you ended up having A LOT of memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were several third party solutions at the time that offered cards with increased capacity and multiple pages, but they weren't always supported and often weren't as stable as official solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With retro gaming being so popular, 8BitMods has created a modern day solution to this problem that is incredibly stable. Last year, after putting together a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2 set up&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;MemCard Pro2&lt;/a&gt; was an essential part. It was one of the most incredible pieces of the set up as I was able to bring all my saves from 25 years ago into the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the MemCard Pro2, the second version of the Memcard was created for the Gamecube, titled the &lt;b&gt;MemCard Pro GC&lt;/b&gt;. They are currently working on a fourth version of the Memcard for exclusive use on the Dreamcast, the VMU Pro. I can't wait for that. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MemCard GC has the same functionality of the PS2 version, complete with WiFi, online memory card page navigation, and Game ID recognition to create unique memory cards for each game. All game saves and information are stored on a micro SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I had planned on &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;modding my Gamecube with the FlippyDrive&lt;/a&gt;, I bought a MemCard Pro GC, which complemented my replacement shell quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard set up for the MemCard Pro GC is mostly the same as it is for the MemCard Pro2. I wrote about those &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; last year. However, transferring saves from old memory cards is a much different process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro SD Card&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Memcard, you'll need an SD card. So, how big did you need? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory cards for the Gamecube were released in 512kb, 2mb, and 8mb sizes. The 8mb card had 1019 blocks available for saves. Most games take up between 3 and 20 blocks, so even as the largest, the 8mb card could hold saves for 50 games. 1gb could hold 125 of those big 8mb memory cards, which would be enough for 6250 games on their own. So, 64gb could hold saves for how many games? 400,000. A number far higher than the number of games released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;64gb is obviously overkill, but a 64gb micro SD card is less than $10 these days. If you don't have a smaller card lying around, it's not too expensive to get a new one. You'll never have to worry about space again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firmware Set Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Memcard wants the SD card formatted in either FAT32 or ExFat. Either is okay, so I went with ExFat. I downloaded the &lt;a href="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public" title="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public"&gt;Latest Firmware&lt;/a&gt; and copied the files onto the card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended downloading a previous version and using the web interface to update it to the most recent version, but I had a lot of problems with that. Don't do that! Just download the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;WiFi Set Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the MemCard Pro is its web interface. Setting up WiFi allows you to change memory cards from the computer rather than hitting buttons on the device. You can also create new cards of various sizes, update firmware, and change around other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you initially insert the Memcard into the Gamecube and turn it on, the screen will ask you to set up WiFi. The Memcard is broadcasting now, and wants you to connect to its signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SSID password is mcpadmin&lt;/b&gt;.

So, you cannot have JP saves sitting alongside NA saves on the same card. Often, the Gamecube will ask you reformat your card when you use it in the wrong region, which would erase all your saves. There aren't any options for the Memcard to set a region for the card. I think once a card is created, you have to manually format it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, some saves are copy protected! Phantasy Star Online, F-Zero GX, Pokemon Colosseum, Fire Emblem, and a few others won't allow you to copy saves using the Gamecube. Some of these are simple flags preventing the copy. However, PSO and F-Zero go a step further by locking the save to the serial number of the memory card. Even if you transferred the save, it would not function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you need some help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamecube Memory Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/suloku/gcmm/releases" title="https://github.com/suloku/gcmm/releases"&gt;Gamecube Memory Manager&lt;/a&gt;, or GCMM, is a homebrew application for the Gamecube, denoted by the &lt;code&gt;dol&lt;/code&gt; file extension. Using this program, you can easily move save files to an SD card and back to a different card. It is way faster than the Gamecube UI, plus you can move copy protected saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To run this, you need a modded Gamecube&lt;/b&gt;. I don't think there's any way of burning this to a disc and having a retail unit run it without help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All homebrew apps work just like disc ISOs on modded Gamecubes, so stick the &lt;code&gt;dol&lt;/code&gt; file with your games, and boot up your Gamecube. Run the app, and you'll get this screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will complain about not having any FAT device connected, and it won't allow you to do any of the actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;My Gamecube is modded with the FlippyDrive&lt;/a&gt;, but I think PicoBoot and some others might have the same problem. The FlippyDrive is bypassing the Disc Reader to send data to the Gamecube. The disc reader is not a writeable storage device, so I cannot send my saves to the FlippyDrive. Not to mention my FlippyDrive's SD card is ExFat, not FAT32, which is what GCMM wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the MemCard Pro is only emulating standard cards. It is not a full storage expansion. Plus, that SD card is also ExFat, not FAT32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a little while to figure this out, but we need a physical FAT32 device to use as storage for our saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;SD2SP2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a device called the SD2SP2 for the Gamecube that acts as a FAT32 storage device for the Gamecube. It is widely available. I bought this one for 999&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; on Amazon with Next Day delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 ports on the bottom of the Gamecube. In practice, one port is used for the Gameboy Player, one port is used for the modem or broadband adapter, and the other port was never used. The unused port is called the Serial Port 2. It's possible developers used this for debugging retail Gamecubes, but its main purpose these days is being used for extra storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After assembling the pieces of the SD2SP2 together and putting in an SD card, it plugs in Serial Port 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't like how this looks. I guess it's supposed to make access to the SD card convenient, but the connection to the serial port isn't perfect. It feels like it will easily fall out. I would much rather have an earlier version that doesn't have the flat bottom, so I could use the port cover to lock it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD Card must be formatted as FAT32, of course. Once everything is plugged in, GCMM immediately detected it on start up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9370.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9370.jpg"&gt;I did full raw backups of each of my memory cards.&lt;/a&gt; Only 5 memory cards this time compared with my mountain of 20+ cards on Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at this point, we're done with the SD2SP2. You don't need to use GCMM to restore backups on the MemCard Pro. And even so, it won't let you do full backups because the memory card serial numbers don't match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next move is on the computer to make these backups workable on the Memcard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory Card Save Splitting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the Memcard is using Game ID to automatically create and switch to a memory card devoted to a single game. Then, you never have to worry about save space. All of my original memory cards had saves from multiple games (as did all of ours), so we want to split all of these up. And we have a program to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodgit created a command line &lt;a href="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro" title="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro"&gt;Memcard save splitting program&lt;/a&gt; to be used with Playstation 1 and Gamecube saves. Just download the latest release and stick it in the directory with your saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD2SP2 created backup files with the &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; file extension, and that's the same file extension used on the MemCard Pro, Dolphin, and all other Gamecube emulators. It's the standard Gamecube Memory Card file format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; on our raws, we get individual cards for each game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the command in text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;./memcardpro split [folder-name] [memory-card-name].raw&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games are separated into folders matching their Game IDs, which is how the MemCard Pro references game unique cards. Add all those folders in the &lt;code&gt;MemoryCards&lt;/code&gt; directory on your Memcard, and they will all be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, I didn't have nearly as many saves as Playstation. Around 30 unique game saves on Gamecube compared to 53 on PS1 and 89 on PS2. But these saves are all pretty special, especially my old Animal Crossing save. Now I can view my house from 20-some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to get 7 NES games back in the day! I don't remember how I did that. My mailbox was completely full, so I think all of my residents sent their goodbyes a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My F-Zero save is also in tact with all tracks unlocked, near complete story progress, all of my old records, all of my custom cars, and a few ghosts. To preserve the serial numbers, I think the save splitter just copies the source &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; and removes all the other game files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of my saves have been added to my &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/apps/ps2/gc/saves" title="https://theschlock.com/apps/ps2/gc/saves"&gt;Modded Console Inventory page&lt;/a&gt;, so you can download them and use them, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the MemCard Pro2 on Playstation, this is the perfect companion to a modded console. You will never run out of space and memory cards will automatically be chosen when games are selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm using &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;FlippyDrive in my Gamecube&lt;/a&gt;, so there isn't a full guide explaining how to do all of this from start to finish. But, Archades Games on YouTube was a huge help. His videos on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0"&gt;backing up saves&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0"&gt;save transfer guide&lt;/a&gt; pushed me in the right direction, along with his set up guides for the MemCard Pro2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many options for playing Gamecube games these days, but if you're still using original hardware, I think the MemCard Pro GC is your best option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Modding the Gamecube with Flippy Drive</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Completing my collection of millenium modded Japanese consoles, I turn to the Gamecube. Overall, it was a solid piece of hardware that had a lot of interesting games and peripherals. There's not a whole lot of bad things you can say about it, except for a slight lack of games. Many publishers were still burnt from the N64 and didn't return. Also, the Playstation 2 was getting huge expansive RPGs that never appeared on this platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are several unique and incredible experiences that became exclusive to the Gamecube. Many of these were from Nintendo themselves, but Capcom, Namco, and Sega helped out. Animal Crossing, Pikmin, Monkey Ball, F-Zero GX, Viewtiful Joe, Baten Kaitos, Resident Evil series revival, Resident Evil 4, and two incredible Legend of Zelda games. Also, Square finally put Final Fantasy back on Nintendo with Crystal Chronicles. It seemed like the curse of the N64 may have been broken, but Playstation 2's shadow was too vast to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have modded the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I would do the same with the Gamecube. And here it is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few hiccups along the way, but it works flawlessly and I'm able to use and manage my 20-year-old saves, too. The main hardware mod that drives my Gamecube is the FlippyDrive on the inside paired with a MemcardPro and the Bitfunx HDMI adapter on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parts List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to the FlippyDrive from yet another one of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPq48Wm8y-U" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPq48Wm8y-U"&gt;Tito's MachoNacho videos&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. After completing my Playstation 2 set up, the idea of modding consoles no longer seemed impossible to me. The FlippyDrive was an internal mod, but it required no soldering and no damage to the original console. Plus, it was a disc reader bypass, so you could still use game discs as normal. Additionally, it was cheap at only $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FlippyDrive was being funded through CrowdSupply and the campaign was still going at the time, so I purchased a deluxe kit on September 9th 2024. It eventually shipped almost exactly a year later on September 11th 2025. In preparation, I purchased several other things to complement the mod:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My full parts list is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;- FlippyDrive Deluxe Kit with Ethernet Adapter and Back Plate&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension" title="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension"&gt;FlippyDrive SD Card Extension&lt;/a&gt; (from Laser Bear)&lt;br/&gt;- MemCardPro GC (from 8BitMods)&lt;br/&gt;- HDMI Adapter (from Bitfunx / Aliexpress)&lt;br/&gt;- Shell Replaement - Grape Translucent (from Aliexpress)&lt;br/&gt;- ...and later, I bought an SD2SP2 adapter from Amazon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using all components required &lt;b&gt;THREE&lt;/b&gt; SD cards. I'm using a 64gb for the MemCard, a 128gb for the SD2SP2, and a 512gb card for the FlippDrive to hold all the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up for the MemCard Pro was a bit messier than I originally thought, so I have detailed that journey &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube"&gt;in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;. This post will focus on the Gamecube mods themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlippyDrive Software Preparation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive is a new mod for the Gamecube amongst a community of already established mods. Its selling point is ease of installation, a more native-looking UI, and a cheap price point. But because it is still so new, I had trouble finding information about how I should prepare the SD card. The Playstation 2 and Dreamcast had very esoteric file structures, so I assumed I had to do something weird here, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the case. You can keep the SD card in ExFat format, and just dump the Gamecube ISOs in the root directory. That's it. There's no specific naming format or folder structure. You can make folders if you want to organize some games, but that's unnecessary. Each Gamecube game is around 1.1gb or 1.4gb, so my 512gb SD card can hold everything I would ever want to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiki has &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/usage.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/usage.html"&gt;some details about SD card prep&lt;/a&gt;, but it's really nothing. Just format the card as ExFat and put in the ISOs. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; it currently does not support RVZ files, which is the common Dolphin compressed format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamecube Teardown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to installing the FlippyDrive, I will be replacing almost all of the outer shell with this Grape Translucent one. Here are all the parts included in the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came with the screwdrivers required for the teardown, and so many many parts. This was way more parts than those included with the Dreamcast replacement kit. (Although, the Dreamcast kit already had the upper shell preassembled.) The box did not come with any instructions, but by following the teardown of the Gamecube, it's not difficult to figure out where everything goes and how things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with experience from the Dreamcast shell replacement, I made the decision to not completely replace everything. I wanted to keep the front gray controller plate, the Gamecube Logo plate on top, and maybe a few other things. I was already not going to use the back plate because I had &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8991.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8991.jpg"&gt;a replacement for the ethernet port&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gamecube shell is held together with only four hexagonal screws. They are removed with &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8992.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8992.jpg"&gt;the included orange-handled screw driver&lt;/a&gt;. These are the only weird screws in the console. All others are Phillips head screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I decided to start work on the upper shell before continuing with the teardown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upper Shell Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there were no instructions, but it was easy to look at the factory assembled shell and figure out which pieces went where and how things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9008.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9008.jpg"&gt;the black lid cover with the Gamecube logo&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that I wanted to use the black handle and the black vent cover in my build. I thought &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9007.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9007.jpg"&gt;the black handle looked very attractive&lt;/a&gt; with the shell rather than having the shell be a complete single color. Also, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9001.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9001.jpg"&gt;the vent cover included in the kit was terrible.&lt;/a&gt; The original cover had a mesh screen for preventing dust from entering. The new cover was just a plastic piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assembling the lid took some acrobatics with the springs. Actually, attaching the handle on first blocked some of the components, so I had to remove it before proceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I figured out that the spring must be connected to its bracket and then fitted into the hole from the inside at the same time as the tray is being fitted from the outside. These two pieces need to connect to each other through the hole, and then the bracket needs to be screwed into place before it falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a while, but eventually it got in there and I could screw it down. Then the bracket on the other side slips into place, and becomes secure with a screw. Finally, the handle goes on over both parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lid latching mechanism was much less difficult to fit into place. When the Open Tray button is depressed, the mechanism rotates to release the tray, and the spring snaps it back into place. It is much stronger and fail-resistent compared with the Dreamcast lid hatching component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new shell, I put the button in first and put the bracket on above it. I think you can do it in either order, though. For the bracket, I fit the spring into the raised side with part of the spring going through the hole. I pulled tension on the spring and fit it on the screw peg. The screw should not be screwed too tightly, as there needs to be enough freedom for the bracket to move back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My kit only came with one widened screw, but the component is so solid, that once the top screw is in place, it holds everything perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final pieces of the upper shell are the buttons. The Power and Reset buttons are easily snapped into their holes. I decided to take the gray Power button from the original console and reuse it. It can easily be removed &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9042.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9042.jpg"&gt;by pushing the pins from the inside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one more piece, the clear plastic piece for the console light. But, I am replacing that with &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9049.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9049.jpg"&gt;Laser Bear's SD Card extension&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm going to install that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an hour and a half, the upper shell is complete, and I think it looks fantastic. The black and gray perfectly complement the solid color everywhere else, and it looks like an official alternate color of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to continue the teardown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower Shell Teardown and Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main componenet in the lower shell is the disc reader. It is held on with 18 screws around its perimeter, but we need to get to all of them first. First, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9071.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9071.jpg"&gt;the back panel comes off easily&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, the front controller panel is held in place &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9073.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9073.jpg"&gt;with plastic latches on the side&lt;/a&gt;. Just pop those out and the controller panel comes free. It is still connected to the base with a ribbon cable, so pull that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the fan is held in place with two screws. The power plug can be detached with a little force and a little wiggle. After that, just start removing all the screws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept all the screws in order of where I pulled them from, but with the exception of the controller port screws, they're all the same. The replacement shell kit did not come with replacement screws, so I will reuse all of these during reassembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the screws removed, the disc reader is held in place by its plug on the motherboard. Again, gentle force, gentle wiggle and it comes right off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, if I weren't doing a shell replacement, I could begin the FlippyDrive installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue the teardown, these six screws must be removed. It may look like their purpose is to secure the hintsink, but they go through the motherboard into the bottom shell. When removed, my heatsink stayed pretty solid on my motherboard. I did not have to worry about it slipping off. I'm not sure if something else secured it other than the thermal paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the screws are removed, the motherboard assembly is only held in place by its bottom plug in the power converter below, like the disc reader was. So, it comes off with some more wiggling. This exposes a metal plate held on with four screws. Remove those and we're nearly at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the remaining pieces are just sitting in place and can be easily picked up, except for the power converter. That has another four screws that are easily removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're now finally at the bottom and can start putting components into their new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the components go back into the same position in the new shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the new shell is resin, not injection molded like the original. This means screw holes have not been primed AND they are slightly fragile. You don't want to over tighten or tighten too quickly. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9165.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9165.jpg"&gt;Otherwise, you might sheer the screw post.&lt;/a&gt; Often, I would move the screw back and forth in its hole to create enough room for it to naturally tighten further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before continuing too far, I removed the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9100.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9100.jpg"&gt;rubber feet&lt;/a&gt; from the original shell and transferred them to the new one. The replacement shell came with plastic ones that seemed stupid. I didn't use any tactics pulling out these feet. I just yanked em out! So, I damaged them slightly. They didn't stay flush in place in the new shell, so I used some epoxy to glue them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going step-by-step, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9094.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9094.jpg"&gt;I added on the power converter&lt;/a&gt; and screwed it in. Next was &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9098.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9098.jpg"&gt;the metal plate&lt;/a&gt; with its screws. And then &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9102.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9102.jpg"&gt;the motherboard plugged into the power converter&lt;/a&gt;, and the six screws going through the heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disc reader is the next component to add, but we need to install the FlippyDrive first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlippyDrive Installation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are all the remaining components left for the lower half along with the FlippyDrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the FlippDrive we have the ribbon cable which sits in the disc reader plug, the FlippyDrive itself, its mounting bracket, the molded back plate with an ethernet port, the ethernet port, and a ribbon cable connecting the port to the drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive Wiki has an &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/installation/flippydrive.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/installation/flippydrive.html"&gt;excellent installation guide&lt;/a&gt;, which I mostly ignored because I had already watched Tito's YouTube video and assembly seemed obvious. This caused a few problems later with the order of assembly, so READ the intructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is making a series of folds on the FlippyDrive's ribbon cable so it can recess in the disc plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to make this wacky W-shape with the folds. The valleys will go into the plug with the middle contacts sitting on the connectors in the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should fit in the plug like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excess ribbon cable should &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9130.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9130.jpg"&gt;fold around some of the case plugs&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for the next step, which is reinstalling the disc reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9133.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9133.jpg"&gt;narrow slit&lt;/a&gt; in each of the corners of the disc reader assembly where the metal is bent downwards. We want to position the ribbon cable so it is fed through that slit as the assembly is pushed onto the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, all we'll see is the end of the cable coming out of that corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next move is screwing in the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9143.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9143.jpg"&gt;mounting bracket near the cable&lt;/a&gt;. The bracket has an extra slot for the screw that is no longer used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippDrive is then plugged into the cable and can then be mounted on the bracket. Depress the ribbon cable gate &lt;b&gt;from the middle of the gate!&lt;/b&gt; Not from the edges. The instructions make a huge point of saying you'll most likely damage the gate by closing on the edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive is now done! But I have two more components to install, the SD card extension and the ethernet port. However, here's where I did a few things out of order because I wasn't following the instructions. This resulted in some backtracking. Here's the correct order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, because I'm using the SD card extension, that ribbon cable should be fed through one of the mounting posts and behind the mounting bracket. This is what &lt;a href="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension" title="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension"&gt;the official installation guide&lt;/a&gt; says. Look at the video on that page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connector is then &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9220.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9220.jpg"&gt;folded back into the SD card slot&lt;/a&gt; on the FlippyDrive. This makes the cable pretty snug in the shell keeping it from getting crushed during reassembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the ethernet port in the back is a VERY tight fit. If the disc reader has been fastened in place with all its screws, the port bumps up against the disc lid sensor on the top and the screw underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to remove all screws holding the disc reader in place so I could slightly lift the disc reader assembly and wedge the port in place as the disc reader assembly was correctly set. This results in a second unused screw. This time, there is no extra place on a bracket to put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Third, I put the ethernet cable in backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue bit goes on the outside not the inside.  LACES OUT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything plugged in, the FlippyDrive just snaps into its mounting bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier versions of the FlippyDrive used tiny screws on the bracket, but they figured out a really convenient way of just having it snap in place instead. It's very solid, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the FlippyDrive installed, it's time to start screwing. Cue the Michael Scott references, but many of the holes were tight and required a lot of back and forth to get everything in correctly. Some of the screws couldn't even go in all the way because things were too tight. So, there are a few screws slightly raised because I didn't want to completely strip them trying to force them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything screwed in, I had dreaded &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9174.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9174.jpg"&gt;putting in the controller port ribbon cable&lt;/a&gt;, but that was surprisingly easy. The blue tape made the cable strong enough to be pushed into its plug on the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the final step, one more piece had to be screwed in, the other end of the SD card extender into the power light position on the top. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9215.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9215.jpg"&gt;It fit perfectly&lt;/a&gt;, and the screws went in easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally at the end! When reassembling the two halves, you should always pop the lid! The back of the lid hits &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9278.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9278.jpg"&gt;the small fragile sensors&lt;/a&gt; in the back. These can easily be broken with too much force. Also, I had to make sure the SD card extender cable was correctly going behind the controller port assembly and in front of the disc reader. Not squished between other components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything in place, it took a little bit of wiggling and force to get it closed, but it eventually snapped on. Then I screwed the outer shell screws to secure it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked so great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD card was very discrete and easily accessible on the outside. The back had an ethernet port. I will probably never use it, but maybe I'll try PSO someday? I do have &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9241.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9241.jpg"&gt;the official broadband adapter&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom, but this doesn't give me access to the FlippyDrive on my network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought it into the other room, plugged it into the TV, and... all my games immediately appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked on the first try. It was so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole build took me over 4 hours, but some of that was a little trial and error and a little Internet research on figuring out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;CubeBoot (aka FlippyDrive OS)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received the Rev9 version of FlippyDrive which came with version 1.4.6 preinstalled. Loading is quite quick and the Gamecube automatically boots into CubeBoot. CubeBoot is the FlippyDrive's native game selection UI. Swiss has become the standard for Gamecube, but FlippyDrive wanted to provide something that felt more native to the Gamecube's own UI. I like this WAY more than just choosing games from a text list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the UI is very barebones. You can only choose games. There are no menus or settings available on the Gamecube itself. There is nowhere to configure Internet settings, and set up Bluetooth for a controller. All configuration is done with a config file on the SD card. &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/configuration.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/configuration.html"&gt;Details are here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, Bluetooth has not been implemented for controllers, so I can't do anything there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you use the ethernet port, you don't need to do any Internet configuration since that is for WiFi only. But, besides playing games on the Internet, ethernet is only used for moving files around on the FlippyDrive. I can easily access the SD card by removing it from the extension, so I don't need that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the outside, I'm using two major accessories, the MemCard Pro from 8BitMods and the HDMI adapter from Bitfunx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MemCard Pro is an amazing device that manages all game saves. Through CubeBoot, it will automatically select and/or create a memory card specific for that game. Set up for the MemCard Pro &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube"&gt;continues in its own post&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little messy getting my original saves onto it, but I figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HDMI adapter is really great, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bitfunx HDMI adapter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best possible image you can get from a Gamecube is using the RGB component cables. But, those can be expensive, plus you'll need an additional device to convert the signal into HDMI for your TV. This HDMI adapter does that and much more. Plus, it was only $25 on Aliexpress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Dreamcast HDMI adapter, this is not doing any upscaling to 1080p. It is receiving the raw signal from the Gamecube and slightly massaging it to the nearest standard HD resolution. You could then pass this into your own upscaler, or just plug it in the TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unlike the Dreamcast HDMI adapter, you have options. &lt;a href="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo" title="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo"&gt;GCVideo comes preinstalled&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you linedoubling and scanlines. These are all options you would have on an OSSC, but it's nice to have them in a device that has everything working perfectly by default. You can access this menu using the included remote. &lt;a href="https://www.bitfunx.com/product/bitfunx-hdmi-line-doubler-adapter-gc2hdmi-for-nintendo-gamecube-ngc-digital-to-hdmi/" title="https://www.bitfunx.com/product/bitfunx-hdmi-line-doubler-adapter-gc2hdmi-for-nintendo-gamecube-ngc-digital-to-hdmi/"&gt;There are more details on the product page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My TV does not have an option to change the aspect ratio to 4:3, but there are several games that have widescreen support including &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9457.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9457.jpg"&gt;F-Zero GX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9430.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9430.jpg"&gt;Monkey Ball&lt;/a&gt;.

I can play all of my old games. I can also play hacks and special versions of games including &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9462.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9462.jpg"&gt;F-Zero AX&lt;/a&gt;, although that doesn't allow saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think modding a Wii or a Wii U might end up being the better option. You would have access to all of those libraries in addition to Gamecube. Also, Triforce games (F-Zero AX and Mario Kart Arcade GP) run natively on Wii and Wii U. I will probably look into this in the future, but I am content with this for now. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Mister, Analogue Pocket, modded Playstation 2, Dreamcast, and the Gamecube, I can play all of my favorite games from the past up through the mid-Bush years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Assassin's Creed Shadows</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Assassin's Creed series finds its way to shove its story into fuedal Japan during Oda Nobunaga's conquest and unification. The long storied franchise which had always focused on Europe and the western expansion of the world spread itself to Japan via the attempted Catholic infiltration and invasion of the country. Like all AC games, you find yourself at a pivotal point in time, and carry out assassinations that shape the country's and world's history to create the world we live in today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows takes place around the year of 1579. Looking at real world history, the bulk of the story is set from 1581 through 1582, but also flashbacks to 1579, where those events serve at the catalyst for one of the protagonist's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe is a young woman from Iga whose family and village are trained in ninjutsu. She was first tested in 1579 when Oda Nobukatsu (Nobunaga's son) launched an unsuccessful attack on their village. Clumsily, she killed her first man as the rest of the ninja repeled the attack. From that day, she continued her hard training to match the level of the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1581 (real life), Oda Nobunaga returned to Iga with his army of over 40,000 men, and slaughtered as many ninja and families as he could find. In the chaos, Naoe's father gathers an important artifact and flees. Naoe follows, but they are both run down by a &lt;i&gt;mysterious&lt;/i&gt; group of 12 masked individuals who call themselves the Shinbakufu. They steal the artifact and brutally injure both Naoe and her father. Her father dies as she loses consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe wakes later in a monastery healed by a boy and an old man. After regaining her strength she vows revenge against Oda Nobunga for slaughtering her village and the Shinbakufu for killing her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewinding a little bit, we are introduced to our other protagonist first, Yasuke. Yasuke is Nobunaga's Black samurai. His main story also begins in 1579 as Jesuit Alessandro Valignano brings him to Osaka as he meets with Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is curious about the black man as almost no one in Japan had ever seen a black person before. They've only ever met white Catholics. Nobunaga is impressed that Yasuke understands the Japanese language, and invites (orders) him to train at his castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Yasuka trains, he learns how a samurai should properly fight by balancing physical strength with mental strength. A duel between men is not just who is stronger, but how you can use your opponent's weaknesses against them. Through achieving this balance and showing his loyalty and honor in a fight, Nobunaga is so impressed that he "knights" him as a samurai. This is when Yasuke proclaims his name as "Yasuke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later in 1581, he is one of the samurai on the front lines attacking the Iga village, Naoe's village. The full game begins with you storming the village and killing ninja after ninja. You play about 15 minutes as him until the game switches to Naoe fleeing the village, and then you don't play him again until many hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Naoe leaves the temple fully healed from her attack, you have nearly free reign of the entire expansive map of pre-Edo Period Kansai. The distances are miniaturized, but the huge map goes from the Kii province in the south (modern day Wakayama) to Wakasa province in the north (modern day southern Fukui). You can travel to Omi province in the east (modern day Shiga, almost Gifu) to Harima and Tamba provinces in the west (modern day Hyogo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visit incredible recreations of Himeji, Osaka, and Niji castles and estates, as well as over a dozen more castles. Armored forts also dot the landscape and there are vibrant towns both large and rich, and small and poor. Outside of the villages, the forests and mountains look incredible. The overall attention to authentic details is amazing. It feels like I'm walking through the forests of Sekighara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These natural, beautiful, and authentic environments are the center piece of Assassin's Creed Shadows. If you see something interesting in a direction, just go in that direction and see what's there. Eventually you find vantage points (towers) that will reveal more points of interest and this curiosity and exploration will continue to push you to all areas of the map. Often at the top of a hill, you'll see a new castle or fort you haven't explored before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in gaming, the idea of "Do you see that building or mountain in the distance? You can go there." is pretty rote, but Assassin's Creed established and populaized this concept of open world exploration in its first game nearly 18 years ago. Actually, the first game is the only other AC game I've played of the whole series. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-impressions" title="https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-impressions"&gt;I wrote some impressions back then, too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to go anywhere and having towers to organically push players into new areas was what made Assassin's Creed such an interesting game that it became a watershed moment, and nearly all other open world games have adopted this idea. Nintendo even took this idea with Zelda Breath of the Wild and it became one of their most highest selling and praised games of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why so Special?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why is Assassin's Creed Shadows so special? Why should you play it? There are really just 3 short reasons. It's a really good "one of those." The graphics looks incredible. And it's set in Japan. Those are really the 3 reasons why people have been so positive about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assassin's Creed has been plagued with mediocre games for years. Once they struck gold with the first games, they kept pumping them out each year. There have been 14 mainline AC games in the last 18 years. And so many of them have been boring, broken, overwhelming, and completely uninteresting according to people. But, it was able to break into the mainstream, so every release kept selling and selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play it because Ghosts of Tsushima was released a few years and seemed to do exactly what Assassin's Creed was doing. It was an open world set in feudal Japan where you run around and reach towers to unlock more points of interest on the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions" title="https://theschlock.com/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions"&gt;I did and did not like Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. From an exploration point of view, it was a bit derivative fully using the same formula as Assassin's Creed, but it was a good "one of those." You could climb almost everywhere and there were interesting hidden points as you explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never wrote my full thoughts on the game, but there were three major things I ultimately really disliked about Ghosts that are (mostly) fixed in Shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest thing I hated about Ghosts was the overall tone of the story and sidequests. Everything was a fucking downer. Of course, the overall story of Ghosts was about the mongul invasion which is a serious subject, but Japanese cinema and story-telling like to add a bit of lightheartedness to their tales. Every sidequest in Ghosts ends with a family murdered, or a town murdered, or any shred of hope dashed in the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My father has gone missing. Can you find him?" He's been robbed and murdered by bandits. "My wife is missing. Can you find her?" Murdered and ripped apart by bandits or monguls. "My children are missing. Can you find them?" Worked to death as slaves in a mongul camp. Why create such a beautiful lush environment only to dot it with the charred remains of villages and bodies of families and children? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, balance is important. Maybe they wanted to balance to beauty of the environment with death. But with the narrative so completely overwhelmed with negatives feelings and imagery, it dwarves the environment. You need some balance within your narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows has a few different side story threads that are pretty ridiculous, especially the Yokai quest line. Much of these goofy quests remind me a lot of the goofy kind of side quests you would find the Yakuza games, the premiere Japanese developed open world game series. Even though they are sometimes too goofy, they play well against the main character who tends to play the straight-man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows never drags me down in the same way that Ghosts did. Although, eventually in the story, I think Naoe and Yasuke become a little too jokey with each other and other characters, so the tone ends up going in the wrong direction a little too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I will say that Jin in Ghosts ends up being a much better developed character throughout the story. Naoe and Yasuke often become more of an avatar for the player, and you can often make choices that contradict the cutscenes and dont't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repetitious Layouts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows hides its repitious buildings, foilage, and enemy layouts with a vast amount of variety. There really aren't all that many different models of trees in the game, but when placed in the environment along the sides of mountains and occasionally in towns, you really don't notice the repetition unless you really pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your base is a great example of this. In Shadows, you get a base and can put together the buildings, trees, and lots of other things anyway you like. I can create a pretty natural looking forest by rotating every tree I place. Combined together, you can't really tell which branches are the same on each tree. The photo below is from my base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some buildings in Shadows are obviously the same, but it doesn't really bother me too much. In real life, there are many houses that are the same because they all hired the same construction company. Also, many textures are reused in other castles and towns. But the layouts of all the castles and town are unique and are often historically accurately the layouts of the castles and towns they are meant to be. Towns and castles also have a lot of unique features that are not used anywhere in the game. Often, the developers tear down some walls or buildings to break up the repetition, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ghosts, all the mongul tents and camp set ups looked identical. Again, it makes sense that they would all have the same tents, but every tent had the treasures and weapons laid out in the exact same position. Each tent also had a same flap exposed in the exact same position so you could sneak in. Tents were almost also laid out in the exact position in every camp, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows also has various army and bandit camps with repeated layouts, but you have so many other castles, villages, estates, caves, mines, towers, and other places where you fight that there is so much variety among repeated elements. They don't hold back their layouts for story sequences only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authenticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghosts prides itself on authenticity. Despite being an American game studio, they took multiple trips to Tsushima island to study the natural landscape, attended workshops focused on the island's culture and traditions, took tons of reference photos, and were also huge fans of classic Japanese samurai cinema, especially of Kurosawa. They used all of this knowledge to create beautiful environments that look like paintings and still images from their favorite films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it felt like a fairytale. Open areas of tall grass blowing like waves in the wind. Rocky mountainous hills with tall cedar trees. Vast marshlands filled with those white marshy flowers. And also snowy mountains to the north so cold that you can't survive away from a fire for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Ghosts prisdes itself on authenticity, but are we supposed to believe this is an actual place? Tsushima is an island in the sea of Japan, which rarely gets snow. And those white marsh flowers only grow in marshes in the mountains, usually around May. Ghosts takes place in November. Also, there's a cherry blossom forest in November, what?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted to shove in too much imagery into a situation that doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environments in Shadows is much more consistent with reality. Also, seasons change over time. Every real-life hour (about) half a season in the year scrolls by. (This also allows for enemies to respawn and match your level.) Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring. In summer, all the forests are a deep green like normal. Rice fields are planted and flooded. In fall, the leaves begin to turn, but also, people are out in the fields harvesting the rice. In winter, snow becomes deep in the north, but it's pretty bare in the south near the ocean, just like real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the seasons changing, it allows them to have all the imagery of Japan that Ghosts wanted to have in a more natural way. The attention to detail in each of the different regions depending on the season is incredible. It feels like the seasons changing in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shallow Story and Characters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think Shadows excels best at exploring the environment, running through castles looting and killing, and naturally finding side story threads, it ultimately feels a bit shallow. Naoe and Yasuke are so stereotypical in their actions and dialogue. There's no weight behind anything they say or do. Everything in the story is telegraphed to the point where there are no real twists or turns. When you meet someone who seems remotely evil... Ah! I'll have to fight or kill this guy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I've spent hours upon hours looting and killing everyone in the castles and forts that when the story says we "need to be careful" and "have a plan" to attack this specific character in a castle I've already been, it's laughable. Here's my plan: I'll just run in there and kill everyone just as I always do. And eventually that's what happens in the story. No build up needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story, dialogue, and character development of Ghosts had so much more weight behind it. Although, the story decisions in Ghosts also fell flat in the end when you just choose which ending to watch with your final action. All your actions throughout the game didn't mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shadows, it was interesting to see how they weaved the overall Assassin's Creed story into Japanese history, but I could've easily just read a bullet point list on a wikipedia page and been just as satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;End of Act 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the story, in Act 1, we were running around as Naoe searching for leads on Oda Nobunaga to exact our revenge. Through various story threads, we meet Akechi Mitsuhide (one of Nobunaga's trusted generals). He tells Naoe that Nobunaga is one of the Shinbakufu, and he sets us up with an opportunity to kill Nobunaga at Honnoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events happen in the same way they supposed did in real history in June 1582. Mitsuhide unsuspectingly lead his army into Kyoto and attacked Honnoji. You are able to use the chaos to fight your way through samurai into the temple where Oda Nobunaga stayed. The temple is set on fire, and you fight Nobunaga while the temple burns down around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the final blow, Yasuke appears for the first time in hours to prevent your assassination. But the attack was successful either way. Nobunaga says that even if he were to flee, he reign as daimyo is over. He could never command his groups with authority again after this betrayal. He asks Yasuke to take his head as he commits seppuku due to his failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe flees the temple. Akechi revealed himself to be one of the Shinbakufu, not Nobunaga. With Nobunaga dead, unification of Japan stands still as the other generals and daimyo know fight for power. Akechi hopes to gain some power for himself, but there are so many rivals in his way. Naoe feels betrayed that she was only used as a pawn in his schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuke soon catches up with her. Naoe weilds a hidden spring-loaded palm knife that she had gotten from her father. She has used to assassinate all her targets so far and it's an iconic staple of all assassins through the AC franchise. Yasuke recognizes this blade. So, rather than fight Naoe out of loyalty for Nobunaga, he asks to join her. Akechi is their common enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining story of Shadows happens in two acts, but the focus of each of these acts happen nearly concurrently. Act 2 story quests focus on elimating the remaining members of the Shinbakufu and eventually reaching Akechi to kill him. Act 3 quests focus on the pasts of Naoe and Yasuke. How did Naoe's father know about the league of assassins and how did they come to Japan? Also, how is Yasuke tangled up with the assassins by knowing about the hidden blade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After tracking down and killing all members of the Shinbakufu, you come to the final battle. Akechi is in Yamazaki castle, and you build your plans to attack with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. You meet a young Tokugawa Ieyasu (above) who takes his army away and doesn't join the battle, claiming that there will be more fighting in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's neat that you meet all three unifiers of Japan in the game. Oda Nobunaga began his campaigns to unify Japan, but was killed before he could complete it. Toyotomi is the second unifier, taking over for Oda in 1582 just after this battle where Akechi is rooted and killed. Nearly all areas of rebellion were quelled and brought under their power by 1592. Then, with Toyotomi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu prevailed in &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara" title="https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara"&gt;the Battle of Sekighara&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed him to seize all power of Japan and usher in an era of peace (albeit under strict rule) for 250 years. It's funny how they protray him as a coward and schemer here as folks in Japan often have the same view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Toyotomi, Naoe and Yasuke lead the charge against Yamazaki Castle and eventually throw Akechi from the keep. Akechi flees on horseback, but Yasuke is able to keep up pace. He is eventually rundown in a small village down the river. Yasuke takes his revenge and cuts down Akechi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real history plays out nearly the same way. Toyotomi attacks Yamazaki Castle and Akechi flees later to be killed in a village nearby by farmers wanting to collect a bounty set by Toyotomi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 3 - Assassin's Creed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching story of Assassin's Creed is the battle of assassins and templars throughout the course of human history. Templars are much like the illuminati who want to control the world and hold all the power to themselves, and the assassins are a brotherhood of warriors who aim to thwart their plans and keep the free will of history to the people. Throughout time, these events have always been centered in Europe, the genesis of most modern day societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through investigating her family's past, Naoe learns that her mother met a Spanish assassin, who was an excommunicated member of the Assassin's Creed. He followed some templars to Nagasaki. Without the help of his brotherhood, he saught to recruit local people to form a Creed of his own to battle the templars. Naoe's mother was his first apprentice and they formed the Japanese brotherhood known as the Kakushiba Ikki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their brotherhood grew, they were able to have an audience with Emperor Go-Nara about the growing threat of templars in Japan. The emperor entrusted them with protecting the Imperial Regalia, 3 historical artifacts of extreme cultural significance (macguffins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Spanish assassin left Japan for some reason, and Naoe's mother continued leading the guild. The templars eventually found their guild. They attacked, killed all members of the guild (almost), and stole the regalia. In reality, Naoe's mother survived the attack and kept one of the artifacts, the jewel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Way back in the opening of the game, this is why the Shinbakufu singled out Naoe and her father. Her father carried this box. By killing Akechi, you were finally able to retrieve this box and learn of its importance. You return in back to its sacred vault underground with another one of the regalia that Hattori Hanzo was able to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin is Yasuke. Yasuke came to Japan as a slave on a boat run by Duarte de Melo and Nuno Caro, both members of the Portuguese templar order. They find Yasuke (whose original name is Diogo) and his mother in their quarters trying to clean some papers that fell on the floor. In typical evil villain fashion, they bring them out on the deck to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shoot Yasuke's mother in the head and turn to him next. But, from above, an assassin appears and a fight ensues. Yasuke is kicked overboard away from danger. This is how he recognized the hidden palm blade held by Naoe. He knows that the assassins fight his enemies, so that's why he wanted to join her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuke tracks down Duarte and kills him. This leads him to Nuno Caro whom he also kills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their plans in Japan were to manipulate the Shinbakufu into stealing the Imperial Regalia and claim it for themselves. Their mission as templars were to bring the regalia back to their order and use it for some plot device bullshit. Ultimately, they wanted to keep the artifacts for themselves as they thought it would help them control Japan by shaping Japanese principles and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think the entire story of Assassin's Creed has become a complete mess, you really only get this tiny kernal of its overarching story here. Shadows feels like a small side story in the universe, even though the game is far from short. (I finished with 165 hours.) I think it's neat how they found a good point in history that made sense for their European order of assassins and templars to reach Japan. And it's neat how this idea of foreign invasion through manipulation was eventually the reason Tokugawa closed to the country to all foreigners in 1602 after he gained control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its flat dialogue and characters, I felt like I had a better experience than I did with Ghosts. Ultimately, I think both games had different focuses and vibes, so it's perhaps not fair to compare them head-to-head. But, I think Shadows did a slightly better job achieving its goals than Ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really excited to play the sequel to Ghosts, though: &lt;b&gt;Ghosts of Yotei&lt;/b&gt;. After watching some minutes of people playing story sequences, the dialogue and voice acting is world's beyond anything in AC Shadows. The location is up in Hokkaido now, so having mountainous terrain and snow make sense. In the differences of elevation, you can naturally have all the variations of environment. The story doesn't focus on a brutal invasion, so I think there is room for some lighthearted elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but I think it has the opportunity to take the best things from both Ghosts of Tsuhima and Assassin's Creed Shadow to create something remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of time, I think playing through Assassin's Creed Shadows is worth it. Once you have full reign of the map, it's amazing to explore the mountains, forests, towns, and castles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games of this magnitude are so impressive that it seems almost a crime to buy it at a reduced price. I ended up getting it for $35 on ebay with a coupon. It should've included the newly released DLC, but they stiffed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before too long, there will be a sale or some kind of bundle where it can be easily got for a cheap price. I'm sure over Thanksgiving and Christmas, you can find a deal. I plan on looking for deals on the $25 DLC at that time, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Game Thoughts</category><category>Games</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>Revisiting Ghibli Warehouse</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I went to Ghibli Park for the first time. I bought the premium Sanpo-pass, so I was able to visit all of the outdoor areas as well as enter the Ghibli Warehouse. The Ghibli Warehouse is very similar to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, but it is much larger and has more areas to explore. You can also take photos throughout the building. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, I went back to Ghibli Park twice in September and October. In September, Zach, Dirk, and I had tickets for a Gyoza festival happening in the same park. This was also the hottest day I had ever experienced in Japan. My dash read 43 or 45 degrees. We walked around to a few areas of Ghibli Park, but didn't have tickets. The second time was in October with Jason, and I had purchased the Mononoke/Witches pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time since writing &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/ghibli-park" title="https://theschlock.com/ghibli-park"&gt;my article last year&lt;/a&gt;, purchasing tickets for Ghibli park have become much more convoluted. At the time of purchasing my October tickets, there were 7 or 8 different tiers of tickets. Each of the outside areas was split into their own ticket and each had an up-sell of entering the Ghibli Warehouse. Even though it was weeks after they were available, I could get a ticket that gave entry for the Mononoke Village, Valley of the Witches, and Ghibli Warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update Dec 2025&lt;/i&gt;: Tickets for Ghibli Park have changed again to become simple like they were before. Now there are only two tiers of tickets available. One ticket that offers entry to all areas of the park. And a second ticket identical to the one I bought for October. It seems like the only way you can enter Hill of Youth and Dondoko Hill is by buying the 7500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though, we only had tickets for entry in the Valley of the Witches, &lt;b&gt;standby tickets&lt;/b&gt; were still available to entry buildings. The premium tickets guarantee entry to these buildings. In the Valley of the Witches, there are 3 buildings: Howl's Moving Castle, the Okino Residence, and The House of the Witches. Howl's Castle sold quickly, but we could visit the two other homes. :) (No photos, though.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Entry for the Ghibli Warehouse was at 3pm, so after visiting our outside areas, we went inside, watched our movie, and walked around. Our film this time was &lt;a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out" title="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out"&gt;Koro's Big Day Out&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, I think I've seen half of the exclusive Museum/Warehouse films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't planning on taking photos, but (1) there was a new area opened in the Warehouse compared to last time, (2) at the end of the day, big lines for photo opportunities were really short, and (3) also it was generally not so crowded allowing for more photos elsewhere. So, below, you can take a look of the photos, and compare them with &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/ghibli-warehouse" title="https://theschlock.com/ghibli-warehouse"&gt;my Warehouse photos from last year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/revisiting-ghibli-warehouse</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/revisiting-ghibli-warehouse</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category><category>Anime</category><category>Media</category><category/></item><item><title>Showa Hall Additions</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Showa Hall is one of my favorite museums or attractions in Takayama. It is a retro museum that showcases many common things from Japanese homes and businesses of the Showa Era (roughly 1927 to 1989). Although, in recent years, many items of the early Heisei period (from 1989) have begun sneaking their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've visited Showa Hall many times. I took a bunch of photos &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall" title="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall"&gt;back in 2014&lt;/a&gt; and recently went &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2" title="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2"&gt;back to 2023&lt;/a&gt; to take a lot more photos. Tourism in Takayama has exploded since my first years living here, so many changes have also happened in Showa Hall. You can see those changes &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2" title="https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2"&gt;in the 2023 post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even since 2023, there have been more changes, specifically upstairs. In 2023, they had a small video game annex running Super Famicom Minis with cartridges and posters on the wall. They have since removed all of their old music memorablia near there and created a replica of a children's room with several toys and video games connected to old TVs. This is much more of a Heisei room than a Showa room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took several photos of the new area, and some of other areas, too. You can see them below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-additions</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/showa-hall-additions</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category/></item><item><title>Hida no Sato Fall Illumination</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Offered only for one month of the year, the fall illumination of Hida no Sato allows people to see the brilliant fall colors light up at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hida no Sato is an open-air museum of old thatched roofed homes from over 80 years ago. All of these homes were transported from their original locations around Hida Takayama into this village located at the base of the Matsukura mountain. Throughout the year, you can view the old classic homes with some beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From October 11th to November 9th this year and only on the weekends, you can enter the museum at night and view the homes and the scenery lit up. Only the areas near the central pond were illuminated, so you couldn't view everything in the village. All of the areas away from the center were pitch black and roped off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend from college, Jason, visited Takayama, and we showed up right as entry for the night illumination began. We got there early enough that the sun had not fully set, and we could easily go in a couple of the homes. I took a bunch of photos, so you can see them below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/hida-no-sato-fall-illumination</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/hida-no-sato-fall-illumination</link><category/><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category><category/></item><item><title>TapTo NFC Reader Enclosure</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After getting a Mister FPGA last year, I wanted to get ALL the accessories and try out everything the system had to offer (within reason). One of the accessories I bought into was TapTo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;TapTo (or Zaparoo)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TapTo (now renamed Zaparoo due to fear (or reality) of trademark infridgement) is a service that constantly runs in the background on Mister. With a connected NFC reader, any NFC signal it reads will automatically run instructions. The main use of this is having a physical set of cards or objects representing your favorite games. Tap the object and the game runs automatically without having to go through menus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a fun way of bringing physicality back to a digital platform, and people have let their creativity fly. There's a replica miniature C64 disk drive with an NFC reader inside, and you insert cards like floppies. Some folks have put NFC stickers on their physical game cartridges and use those to boot up games. People print their own NFC cards with various styles and images. People have also made figures with NFC buttons inside. The sky is the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I thought this was all unnecessary. You're removing one of the advantages of having a digital platform which is reducing your amount of clutter. But, you can have TapTo (Zaparoo) do more than just execute games. You can have it execute button macros. And you can have it execute random games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was most interested in the random games. The standard randomization is to have it choose a console and execute a random games on that console. But, unlike the Analogue Pocket, you can build lists of favorites on the Mister using MGL files. So building lists of my favorite games in each genre, I can Tap a card, and have it run a random Shooter or Puzzle game or Fighting game. These are all single serving games, so it makes sense to randomly try one for 5 or 10 minutes and find a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, rather than use printed cards, Nintendo Amiibos use NFC, too. I could register the Pacman Amiibo to boot up a random arcade game, and use Ryu to boot up a Fighter. Dr. Mario for Puzzle games. And for Shooters? A Vic Viper would've been amazing. The closest is Star Fox, but those figures look terrible. I just went with Mega Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;NFC Reader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use any NFC reader with Mister, but all the official images used a particular one. It was only 764&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; on Aliexpress! So cheap! Why not buy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so small! I was thinking that it would be the size of a trading card, but it's less than half that size. This is great because it has allowed creative folks to sneak it into their enclosures and even in their Mister cases. My Mister case is shoved into the shelf, though, so it's not practical for me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a platform that could stick out of shelf for easy placement of Amiibo figures. Because the reader is like a tiny trading card, I thought I could use one of those hard plastic trading card protectors. Just screw the thing in there, and it would make for a pretty piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard Plastic Card Protector&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon had a few different sizes of these sandwich plate style plastic card protectors available, so I bought a standard trading card size and a smaller size closer to the dimensions of the NFC reader. This one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1"&gt;Amazon Link&lt;/a&gt;. Now, a year later, it's out of stock, but I bought it for only 660&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Maybe that's expensive for a single card protector, but I think it's a good price for an NFC enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, with buying this protector, I wasn't really thinking about how the reader was going to slip between the two plastic plates. A card is as thin as paper. The PCB of the reader is thicker than that, plus it has a USB-C connector on it. The protector came with a thin plastic frame border for the card to hold it in place, but that would not work with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the protector was a good size, but I did not think about the USB-C connector. I wanted the PCB more centered, but the USB-C plug on the cable is WAY thicker than the connector. The USB-C connector would have to be flush with the outer rim of the plastic for it to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The included screws weren't longer enough for added height, so I had to buy some new ones. My local hardware store was able to identify the guage of the screws at M4. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/tapto/IMG_2660.jpeg" title="https://theschlock.com/image/tapto/IMG_2660.jpeg"&gt;They sold these packs of screws, nuts, and washers.&lt;/a&gt; I had a few different lengths from some other projects, but I bought one of those packs with 15mm length screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I ultimately used the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Screws - M4 Size - 15mm Length&lt;br/&gt;4 Nuts - M4 Size&lt;br/&gt;8 Washers - M4 Size&lt;br/&gt;4 Thumb Nuts - Reusing the ones including with the protector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a little tight, but it had to be to hold the USB-C connector in place. If it was too loose, the plates wouldn't hold it and you couldn't plug it in without pushing the PCB in further. Although, too tight and it could've cracked the plates or warped the connector. Adding the washers and screws gave it just enough height to hold it in place well enough. Although, it still slipped around and it could be pulled out easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perfect solution would be to design a 3D printed bracket that could be flush with all edges of the plates and hold the NFC reader in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;3D Printed Bracket&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after almost a year after putting the plates together, I finally designed a bracket. I didn't realize that my sister had a small 3D printer, so it was the perfect excuse to finally make this thing. Her model of printer was a ToyBox, a more accessible consumer level printer which allowed her kids to make little figurines and such. It also accepted custom STL files, so you could still print whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking online, &lt;a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" title="https://www.tinkercad.com/"&gt;TinkerCad&lt;/a&gt; was recommended as an easy online program for creating STL files. And it was really easy to figure out how to move around the view, create objects, and also create negative objects which cut into the solid shapes ultimately creating and shaping your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being very precise and measuring all lengths using a tape measure, I put together the model. The plates measured 74mm by 74mm, and I added 5mm height. The NFC reader measured 40mm by 61mm, so I added some grooves for the reader to rest into the model and stay in place. I added rounded corners and measured the screw holes. I also added some divots for the washers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not take long to create the model. I cut out more of the solid areas to use less material when printing. Also, I flipped the model upside down thinking that it would be better to have the flat areas printed first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the file: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs / TapTo Bracket Thin Upside-Down.stl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister had several failed attempts trying to print it for some reason. I've never owned a 3D printer, but it seems like there's so much variance in print quality depending on properly seeding the model to the bench, using quality materials, making sure the printer head is clean to allow clean material on the bench, the speed of building the model, and generally just the overall quality and precision of the printer itself. Seems like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Jason was coming to visit, so I asked if he knew anyone with a decent printer setup. And he was able to get an clean print of my file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an exact clean print! It felt nice and sturdy compared to other 3D printed parts I've had before. It was SO exact that when I put the NFC reader into place &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8755.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8755.jpg"&gt;it perfectly snapped into position.&lt;/a&gt; There was absolutely no clearance. It was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took apart the base, and began assembling it with the bracket in the middle. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8769.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8769.jpg"&gt;The washers fit in the divots perfectly.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8771.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8771.jpg"&gt;The screw holes matched exactly with the screw holes on the plastic plates.&lt;/a&gt; Things were tight, but all the dimensions were exact enough that it fit together like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB-C connector was a little recessed in the bracket, but the connector on the plug was long enough to compensate. And it fit in the connector perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After fitting everything together, I was so amazed at the results. I would expect there to be some problem with size or quailty or variance. Like the print would be slightly too large or small. Or maybe there was some piece of the PCB sticking out that I hadn't noticed before. Or the inlets weren't deep enough. Or I messed up my measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no problems at all. It fit like a glove. Pac-Man agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel to use the file and part list to create your own. The only thing I would add is a TapTo or Mister FPGA sticker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/tapto-nfc-reader-enclosure</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/tapto-nfc-reader-enclosure</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Modding a Sega Dreamcast</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I started thinking about the Dreamcast again. The recent ADGQ run of Crazy Taxi resparked some dormant brain cells and reminded me of all the arcade fun the console had to offer. Ultimately, back in the day, I would shelf the console in favor of the Playstation 2 and its library of much deeper story telling games. But, the console would occasionally get pulled out of storage when friends were around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this wave of nostalgia, I purchased several hardware mods to build an ultimate Dreamcast with all my favorite games available to play at a touch. I received all the packages, but my Dreamcast was half a world away in the United States. This summer, I returned home, and now I have all of my original Dreamcast hardware on hand, and finally took the weekend to put everything together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoilers. It is excellent, and I am amazed how easy it was to install everything and how seemless everything worked on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreamcast Hardware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is all of my original hardware from back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few surprises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I had completely forgotten that I bought a VGA box. After really crawling into my memory about when this happened, I do recall hooking it up to my LCD monitor a few times. But I never used it that way for long periods of time because it was a nuisance to my computer set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, I had also forgotten about some other prior modding. 2007 was probably the last time I had used my Dreamcast. At that time, I had purchased some new Shmup releases and the discs would scrap along the shell inside of the disc tray. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/end-gen-dreamcast" title="https://theschlock.com/end-gen-dreamcast"&gt;I made a few modifications&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.jpg"&gt;taped the lid sensor&lt;/a&gt; to always be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreamcast Mods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For modding and upgrading the Dreamcast, I purchased the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;GDEmu Disc Emulator&lt;/b&gt; (8019&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $53.46)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Noctua Fan Replacement&lt;/b&gt; (4924&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $32.82)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;DreamPSU Power Supply Replacement&lt;/b&gt; (3304&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $22.03)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Console Shell Replacement&lt;/b&gt; (in Smoke Black) (4994&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $33.29)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Bitfunk Dreamcast HDMI Adapter&lt;/b&gt; (2519&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $16.79)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Retro Fighters D6 Controller&lt;/b&gt; (released in Feburary 2025) ($65.89)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;8BitMods VMU Pro&lt;/b&gt; (in Smoke Black) (released in November 2025) ($94.44)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;128gb SD Card&lt;/b&gt; (2865&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $18.77)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 5 hardware mods were purchased from AliExpress from various retailers. I bought the D6 Controller from Retro Fighters directly. The VMU Pro isn't out yet, but it's only available through the 8BitMods site. Those prices include shipping to Japan. Maybe it's a bit expensive, but I think it's a small price to have a dedicated machine that can easily play all of these great games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should note that understanding which mods to buy and what was required came from another one of Tito's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA"&gt;Macho Nacho YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;my PS2 build&lt;/a&gt;. He put all of this stuff together a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to skip using the DreamPSU and the HDMI Adapter. Since its release, the DreamPSU has had &lt;a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html" title="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html"&gt;some criticism&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like the DreamPSU doesn't really offer anything new to the Dreamcast, and could potential cause harm. If there's nothing wrong with your current Dreamcast power supply, then there's no reason to get rid of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I skipped the HDMI adapter because I am able to get crisp video through the VGA box. I can pass the VGA and audio signal into my OSSC, and use that to display on my TV through HDMI. Also, the HDMI adapter works with the VGA signal, so the few games that don't work with VGA won't work with it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Saturday afternoon was spent replacing the Dreamcast shell and installing the GDemu and the fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the GDemu only works on &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.jpg"&gt;version VA1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; consoles, denoted by the circled 1 on the bottom sticker. Revision VA1 consoles are the most common, so you most likely own that one. VA0 consoles were only produced through mid-1999, so perhaps only launch models in the US were VA0. The VA1 started production in mid-1999 and continued through late 2000. VA2 revision models began production around October and December 2000, but so they may have come to market in early 2001, a few months before Sega announced the Dreamcast was done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disassembly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dreamcast can be completely taken apart using a Phillips head screwdriver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disassembly starts with the 4 screws keeping the outer shell in place. You'll need to remove the modem to get at the 4th corner screw. With the shell removed, nearly all the inner components are visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GD reader is the large piece in the middle. We'll replace that with the GDemu unit later. The left component is the power supply. The on/off switch in the front left is plugged into it. The controller port assembly is the component in the front. It has a battery that manages the internal clock. It also gives power to the fan on the right. Everything sits on top of a metal shield. The Dreamcast motherboard is between this shield and another one on the very bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first component to remove is the GD reader. Mine was attached using 2 screws, even though there were holes for 3 screws. Maybe I lost one while I was messing around in 2007.  Be sure to pull it out as an entire unit with the metal plate on the bottom. You don't need to disassemble the reader itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the power supply. The power supply is held in place by 2 screws and its connection to the motherboard. First, unplug the on/off switch connected in the back and then remove the screws. The motherboard connection is really strong, so it can be difficult to pull it off with finesse. I rocked mine back and forth a bit, but be careful not too do this too much as it could dislodge the connector from the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power supply has a plastic shield that sits between it and the surrounding components, so don't lose that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next component to remove is the controller assembly in the front. You'll need to remove the power cable going to the fan and unplug the ribbon cable going to the motherboard. Both cables are removed pretty easily. Just gently rock them back and forth with a little bit of force and they'll come out. The component is held in place with 4 screws next to the controller ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, there are only 3 more components to remove. The fan and the power button are only held in place with 2 screws each. Those are easy to remove. The direction they're installed is important, but it's easy to tell which was they go. We'll replace the fan later, so we don't need to worry about that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final component is the motherboard, sandwiched between two metal shields, screwed to the bottom of the shell with 8 screws. After removing the screws, the upper metal shield is still attached to the motherboard with a few plastic pins. Removing them is unnecessary, so leave them alone. You can remove the upper shield and motherboard together as a single piece. The video plugs are set into the shell, so it takes a bit of movement to find the right angle, but eventually you can pull the motherboard out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that remains is &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.jpg"&gt;the bottom shield&lt;/a&gt; with two termal pads. Nothing is holding this in place, so it's easy to pull out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reassembly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I removed each component, I laid the screws next to them so I could remember which screws were used in which positions. Only a few components will be replaced, but these components rely on reusing the original screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new shell, first I placed the bottom thermal shield. Then, I screwed in the power button. It's important to note that the front plastic controller port panel must be set in place before putting the motherboard in. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, make sure the termal pads are in the correct position on the bottom plate before putting the motherboard in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One small problem with my reassembly was a single screw &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.jpg"&gt;being misaligned&lt;/a&gt;. All other points of the motherboard were perfect except for this small spot. I'm not sure why this happened, but I decided to proceed rather than remove everything and solve the problem. The screws only held the board in place and it was very secure without this screw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the motherboard was secure, I put the power supply back into place, and made sure to put the plastic shield in the correct position. Make sure the power button cable moves underneath the component like it did before. Push the board into its connector, screw it in with the 2 screws, and connect the power button. The power plug in the back should be flush with the shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the front, angle the controller port into the shell, then use the 4 screws to attach it to the build. Then plug in the ribbon cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, everything should be pretty smooth, and we have only the fan and the GDemu left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreamcast GDemu Disc Emulator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDemu is a PCB with an SD card slot and a button. It plugs into the motherboard in the exact position as the GD reader and acts as an emulator. Here's the GDemu board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the GD reader reads the discs and gives data to the motherboard, the GDemu also sends game data. You fill up the SD card with a bunch of games, and the GDemu reads the currently selected "disc" and sends the data to the board. The SD card needs to be in a specific format, but I did that &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation" title="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation"&gt;preparation back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the SD card, each disc is stored in a specific numbered position, so the GDemu ultimately acts like a disc changer. The first CD in the list is the default disc loaded when the Dreamcast is turned on. This is where the GDemu menu application is stored. From the menu, you can choose any game you installed. Additionally, you can switch games/discs using the button. Pushing the button loads the next disc in the list. This is really only useful for multi-disc games, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;GDemu Assembly and Installation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDemu package came with everything you see here: the GDemu PCB, SD card extender, an 8gb SD card, some plastic pieces, and some screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not come with any instructions, so I was supposed to figure out how everything went together on my own. It's not too difficult to understand, but there are a few things that aren't so obvious. I found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU"&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of a guy putting together nearly the same thing, which helped me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, you don't need any of the plastic parts to connect the GDemu. You can plug the GDemu into the motherboard directly and be done with it. However, the purpose of the plastic pieces is to seel the internal components from the outside and allow the fan to do its job of efficiently venting hot air. Whether or not the fan actually does this is a different question, but its best to try and help the Dreamcast accomplish this original goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in assembly is attaching the SD card extender to the large plastic cover. There are 2 tiny screws used to do this. (I had to use a smaller Phillips screwdriver to accomplish this.) &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.jpg"&gt;With the SD card extender in position&lt;/a&gt;, the tiny screws don't screw into it. They screw into the post beside it, and hold the extender in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That YouTube video was very helpful for understanding that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is screwing the GDemu board into the same plastic assembly. Connect the SD card extender into the SD card on the GDemu board. The ribbon cable is too long, but it's okay to have the extra length spill out of the back. There's nothing behind it that is harmful. You may be able to fold the cable inside of the plastic piece, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board attaches with two screws. Be sure to put the button into the plastic shell before screwing in the board. Also, be sure not to screw the board too tight. The bigger plastic button needs some clearance so it can click the board's button easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there should be one long screw, one short screw, and one more plastic tube piece left. After plugging the GDemu into the motherboard, it becomes obvious where these pieces go. The back end of the plastic cover lines up perfectly with one of the GD reader screw holes. This is for the short screw. The front edge of the GDemu board hovers over another screw hole. The plastic tube props up the board and allows the screw to pass through into the base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything assembled and screwed into place, the GDemu board should be held above the metal shield. It looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noctua Fan Mod&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final bit to install is the Noctua Fan. My order included the full fan kit, and a few extras. We only need the fan and a single screw from the full kit. The extras where some 3D printed brackets, and a conversion cable from the fan to the Dreamcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D printed pieces were so cheap. I'm no 3D printing expert, by the overall quality looked like they used a 1st gen 3D printer to make them? What creates that rough unfinished imprecise surface? Is that from using poor materials? Or not properly calibrating your machine? Or not steadying the model on the surface pad while printing? They look so ugly, but they're internal components, so who cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusing the screws from the original Dreamcast fan, I attached the new fan hood to the shell. Then using one of the included screws in the kit, I attached the fan to the hood. Make sure the direction of the fan is going outward. There's a small arrow on the fan indicating its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After plugging the fan cable into the controller port board, I scrinched the cables under the controller port ribbon cable to keep them secure in a position away from touching something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's one final modification left. The Noctua fan takes up more space inside the Dreamcast and it interferes with the lid hatch. The mechanical component is a full squared piece and a section of it needs to be removed. Because of this, we've given those other two printed pieces as a lid hatch replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the terrible print quailty of the components caused troubles. The inner peg is meant to be shoved through the larger peg and create the lid hatch. My inner peg was too fat, or the hole was too thin, so when pushing the peg through the hole it didn't go all the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peg was about 2mm longer, which meant the whole piece couldn't fit into the lid flushly. I tried shoving the peg in further and wiggling it into place, but it was still too long. I used a nail file to make the piece a little thinner and that worked. Although, not really. Now the piece was too loose so when the Open Tray button was pressed, the lid latch wouldn't go back into its extended position, so the lid couldn't be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lid latch component is very delicate. It needs to be loose enough to freely move back and forth between the two screw posts. When the button is pressed, it moves one way, then the spring brings it back to its original position. So, the two pieces also need to have a complete strong bond together so the spring doesn't pull the latch back on its own. Using the nail file, the middle piece was now too loose. Why did they print this as two pieces? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still had some epoxy from an earlier project, so I glued the two pieces together. The cheapness of the material probably helped fuse the two pieces together even better than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the piece was still too rigid in the lid. I used my screwdriver head to widen the holes even more, and the piece finally moved smoothly. Much like the button component, these screws should not be too tight. They should be just tight enough to hold the piece into position and allow it to move freely back and forth. The lid finally opened and closed like it was supposed to after all this work. (This was the longest part of the physical build.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complete&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the pieces of the puzzle finally put into place, I secured the top part of the shell on to the base, tightened the outer 4 screws, and the build was complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plugged the VGA box into my OSSC, plugged video and power in to the Dreamcast, turned it on, and it worked perfectly the first time. That beautiful Dreamcast opening filled the room with its ambience, and the GDemu menu popped up showing all the games &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation" title="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation"&gt;that I had added back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video Conversion and OSSC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Dreamcast is using the VGA Box that I purchased decades ago to send its video signal into the OSSC. The OSSC translates that into an HDMI signal which I'm plugging into my TV. Even though I just bought a new TV, my TV doesn't really like 480p signals and it really doesn't like 960p signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FirebrandX had created the "perfect" timings for the Dreamcast a couple years ago with the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Sync opt. &gt; &lt;br/&gt;    Analog sync LDF = Off&lt;br/&gt;Output opt. &gt; &lt;br/&gt;    480p/576p proc = Line2x&lt;br/&gt;Sampling opt. &gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sampling phase = 45 deg&lt;br/&gt;    480p in sampler = DTV 480p&lt;br/&gt;    Allow upsample2x = off&lt;br/&gt;&lt; Adv. timing &gt; 480p:&lt;br/&gt;    H. samplerate = 858&lt;br/&gt;    H. Synclen = 62&lt;br/&gt;    H. backporch = 111&lt;br/&gt;    H. active = 640&lt;br/&gt;    V. synclen = 6&lt;br/&gt;    V. backporch = 34&lt;br/&gt;    V. active = 480&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This causes a black screen for me because my TV doesn't like 960p signals. Turning the output option back to PassThru also creates a black screen with these settings. If I leave all these values at default, I get a very beautiful image, but unfortunately it's stretched to the 16:9 ratio as shown above. My TV doesn't have a 4:3 option, so I would need another box that converts 480p or 960p to a 1080p signal and allows 4:3 to be forced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Bitfunx HDMI converter does force 4:3 and gives a clean image, but there are no video options at all. You can't do scanlines or change the fuzziness of model edges. I dunno... it doesn't look right to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, between choosing an imperfect toolbox or a single use hammer, I think I'll stick with the toolbox. If I somehow can afford a RetroTink4k in the future, then that's probably the best path for me and my TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;RetroFighters D6 Controller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I built my setup for the Playstation 2, I also bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver so I could use a modern wireless controller with the old games. Wanting to do the same with the Dreamcast, I looked around for options. I decided to purchase the D6 controller from RetroFighters, which is unconventional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this controller a lot, although I don't think it's for everyone. I wrote a review &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller" title="https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller"&gt;in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;8BitMods VMU Pro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet to be released, 8BitMods is in the final stages of completing its VMU Pro. The VMU Pro is a high-end game device that manages all of your Dreamcast save files, but goes further with a full color LCD screen and allows its own custom software to be run. In particular, they have shown video of running 8-bit emulators for GameBoy, GameBoy color, Master System, and the NES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's being billed as the original ultimate vision of the Dreamcast VMU finally coming true. Preorders began back in May and it should finally ship in November. I will make a post about it after I've had long enough to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Dreamcast Lives on!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with how well this whole project came together. Installing all the mods was very simple. Managing games and details is also very simple. And there is still more to come with the VMU Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While playing pirated games on the Dreamcast has been available since its release, it's amazing how much the tech has matured over the years, and how much stuff is still being released for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a Dreamcast in storage, I would suggest giving these mods a try. You'll be able to relive all those old memories again, and make some new ones with unique games you never had a chance to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite games of all time, Rez, originated on the Dreamcast. These days, there are other modern ways of playing with a few more options. But, there's a debug version of Rez which allows you to mess with performance, enemies variance, and also have a free camera! (More on this in the future, maybe)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modded-console-game-inventory" title="https://theschlock.com/modded-console-game-inventory"&gt;Modded Console Game Inventory&lt;/a&gt; page has been updated with all the games I plan on giving a try. Take a look and see if having a Dreamcast library immediately available to play on your TV sounds right for you. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>RetroFighters D6 Controller</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When modding and building a full modern day &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast"&gt;set up for my Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt;, I was in the market to look for a modern controller to use with it. The original Dreamcast controller was fine for it's day, but the controller is really big and clunky. Also, the D-pad is tiny and imprecise. I wanted something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I built my &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;setup for the Playstation 2&lt;/a&gt;, I bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver, so I could use a modern Playstation controller with the old games. Wanting to do the same with the Dreamcast, I looked around for options. However, Dreamcast controllers are very unique because you connect the memory card to them. There isn't a separate slot on the console like the Playstation and Gamecube. So, buying a Bluetooth receiver for the controller port isn't the best option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found RetroFighters, a vintage game controller manufacturer which created wireless Dreamcast controllers with the use of Memory Cards in mind. For their wireless controllers, the reciever plugged into the controller port is a large unit where you also plug in your memory card. Their most popular controller is the StrikerDC, but I decided to go with their most recent controller instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released in late 2024, the D6 Controller looks more like a Saturn controller than a Dreamcast controller. It has 6 face buttons instead of 4 and it only has a D-Pad rather than both a D-Pad and a Stick. RetroFighters' goal for the D6 was to create the ultimate handheld controller for Dreamcast fighting games. The movement of the D-pad matches that of the Saturn, so you can get those perfect fireballs compared with the D-pad on the standard controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the buttons are very clicky, which can turn people off, but I think the controller feels amazing. I think it's even better than the 8bitdo's M30. This is mainly because all of the buttons are the same size. Super Nintendo games feel terrible on the M30 because the top row of buttons are smaller and more concave. The D6 gives equal size and importance to all buttons, and the button presses feel great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I wanted this controller because it comes with a USB dongle. The StrikerDC only works with the Dreamcast so it's a single-use $55 controller. With the D6, I can use it with the Analogue Pocket, the Mister, and even the Switch for simple games. (It's excellent with Tetris.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the biggest question...  How does this controller work for games like Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure, or anything that uses the Stick for movement? On the bottom of the controller, there's a mode switch. All the way to the left, the D-pad operates as the D-pad. Switch the mode to the middle, and the D-pad operates as the Left stick. Switch the mode to the right, and it's the Right stick, which was the Dreamcast doesn't have, but other consoles do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still limited in that you can't use both the Left stick and D-pad at the same time. Also, the D-pad focuses on digital input, so games that rely on Analog movement from the Left stick won't feel so great. In this case, the original controller would be the better option. But, for the niche this controller is trying to fill, I think it works perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, as another note, the receiver base only allows a single memory card as opposed to original controllers which have two slots for two memory cards. I think this is because the controller has vibration. So, it's using a fake second slot as a rumble pak. Ultimately, I think this is another con against the controller as you can't do any memory management with just the controller. You'll need a second controller, or do management directly from VMU to VMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think it's a great controller, although it's not the ultimate solution for playing all games on the Dreamcast. It feels great to pick up and hold, and cycling through menus is a breeze. It's worth the money in my opinion if you have a Dreamcast, enjoy playing fighting games on the Dreamcast and don't like arcade sticks, and also have several other devices or consoles with retro games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller</link><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/></item><item><title>Tsukechi Gorge 付知峡</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When crossing the border from Hida into northern Nakatsugawa, the Tsukechi river becomes one of the major lifelines of region, both shaping mountains and determining where ancestores settled. The basin of Tsukechi town is home to many farms, onsen, and camping grounds as everyone is just one step away from nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tsukechi river is formed from all the runoff of the surrounding towering mountains. Following the river up to its source, some the valleys are so close together, over millenia the rushing water has created deep recessions resulting in several gorges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area along the river to the east has dubbed itself as The Tsukechi Gorge. It's free to park and free to walk, but they do ask for a 200&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main feature of the hiking are some beautiful slightly engineered waterfalls that contribute to the crystal clear blue water below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a very easy hike and offers some great views of nature. So much so that it attracts a lot of attention from city folk. I was quite surprised at &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7732.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7732.jpg"&gt;how many people came to this place&lt;/a&gt;. People were everywhere on the trails, and there was often congestion. It was a national holiday, though, so I guess everyone had off from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to get a quick couple of shots of my friends on a bridge through the woods without others walking by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zach, Dirk, and I stayed at &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/doai-onsen" title="https://theschlock.com/doai-onsen"&gt;The Doai Onsen&lt;/a&gt; the night before, so getting to the Tsukechi Gorge was easy. We arrived around 10am, which was apparently right before the rush. We hiked around the gorge for about 40 minutes maybe. By the time we were leaving, there was a line of cars down the one-lane mountain road waiting to park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why everyone decided to come here on this day, but it might be best to visit on a weekday if you come up here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/tsukechi-gorge</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/tsukechi-gorge</link><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Travel</category><category>Japan</category><category/><category/></item></channel></rss>
