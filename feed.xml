The 2.0 update brings a complete rewrite of progression through leveling, equipment, and other systems. Graphics have been updated for modern consoles and PCs. And a new expansion adds a new story that expands the life of Night City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(19)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night City is the setting of Cyberpunk, a sprawling multi-leveled metropolis. Depending on where you visit, it can be many things. It's a dark, dank, depressing slum festering with gangs, addicts, and trash. It's a futuristic neon haven vibrant with youth and life. It's a posh urban center of business and industry. It's a crime ridden war zone with constant shoot outs between cops and gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter where you go, the city is dense. Many citizens live in massive mega buildings that act as their own cities. Stores and other places of interest are often on different levels forcing you traverse Night City's maze of verticality. Streets and highways bend and elevate to different areas. The native GPS in the game is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprawling out from its dense centers, the outer edges of Night City has oil fields, solar collectors, and farm protected by greenhouses to sustain the massive amount of resources that fuel the city and its people. Small poor neighborhoods also grow on some pockets. Even further away are the badlands, a rocky desert where little grows and dust storms are common. There are also huge trash fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(48)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk depicts a future where many of us think we're headed. Urban centers continue to collect more and more people, and the surrounding environment is ravaged of its resources to sustain them. Singular corporations rule the city and retain most of the wealth, which bleeds its citizens of their lives and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the story begins as you play as V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- - - - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new update, I started a new character to see what the game now has to offer, and it's keeping my attention much more than before. I've been streaming it here and there, and taking plenty of photos along the way. I'll keep adding more photos as I continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I'll start up the DLC, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/cyberpunk-2077</link></item><item><title>Shiraki-mine 白木峰</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Shiraki-mine is the highest peak of the mountain range separating the borders of south Toyama and north Gifu. It is one of the tallest mountains in the area at 1596 meters, and on a clear day, you'd be able to view both Toyama and Takayama cities from the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(61)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a friend coming to visit who was interested in doing a million things, and I had this mountain marked on my map from a while ago. So, we decided to take a look!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pin on my map was for a parking lot pretty close to the peak, but after searching for hiking paths and current conditions, the Hida wilderness website marked the road closed due to a landslide. There's a hiking website (&lt;a href="https://yamap.com/" title="https://yamap.com/"&gt;yamap.com&lt;/a&gt;) where people record their hikes, and the most recent hikes of the mountain seemed to confirm it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using yamap as a guide, there were several places where we could start our hike, but ultimately we planned on starting at the campground where the road had been closed and going from there. Hikes on yamap confirmed this was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The Climb&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took way longer to get to the campground than I had expected. We left a little later than planned, but the winding roads made us move very slowly.  Google Maps said it would only take an hour from my apartment. I think we left around 8:15am and finally made it to the campground at 10:05am. Even though we made two quick stops along the way, it took nearly 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campground was a nice piece of civilization carved out of the heavy thicket of trees and bushes. There was even a museum, or some kind of cultural hall, that detailed the surrounding nature. We didn't have time for it, though, and went straight on the path forward up the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(4)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path itself was just the closed road, so it was pretty easy. We walked passed several dammed and relegated streams coming from above. Some of the cement structures lower in the streams had been eroded away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climb was steady and kept going and going. It wasn't long before we could see some of the height we had already traveled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(8)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;45 minutes later, we hit the detour.  We had known that the road was closed due to a landslide, and the sign directed us to take this trail instead. It indicated that it led to the summit, and another hiker of their way down informed us that this was the way to go.  So we went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at Google Maps, it seems like the trail was about 600 meters.  Certainly not as long as the 3km we had already walked. However, our gradual 20 degree incline significantly spiked to 45 degrees, or more. The course had ropes to help pull ourselves up the climb, but it was still pretty rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(13)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in any marathon, you continue to push through and continue to move. The longer you stop, the longer it takes. But, my partner in climb doesn't do marathons, so we often took some breaks, which ended up being necessary. This trail completely exhausted my supply of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 45 minutes later, we reached the trail head and made it back to paved road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(17)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having gained some significant height, and as the paved road winded around the mountain to gain height, we often had a view that looked down on the path we've traveled. Just 10 minutes later, the top of the trail head looked so small and far away. Another 20 minutes later, even further. One of the best parts about this hike we being able to visually observe the distance we had traveled. We wouldn't have gotten this experience by simply driving to the top. On the other hand, we wouldn't have been dying of thirst and exhaustion either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 30 minutes, we reached the upper parking area at 12:15pm. There was no running water, but there were some jugs of water as to use as an emergency. It did not look safe, so we moved onward and upward. Often there were trails that appeared on the side the road that offered us a shorter path to the top. But, we had already experienced the cost of such shortcuts from the detour earlier, so we continued on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;45 minutes later, the emergency shelter came in view. We climbed up to it and took a break inside. Nearly to the top!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the shelter gave us our first grand view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(40)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we stopped for about 10 minutes, and continued along the wooden path. Some of the path had degraded, and other parts were washed away from rain. The path looked like it went back down the other side of the mountain, which we didn't want to do. But, I scouted ahead and the path only dipped a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the corner, the path connected with the ridge line path. Going to the right, it lead to the peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Summit &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山頂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nearly 3 hours of walking and hiking, and a total of around 8 or 9 kilometers, we had made it to the top. From the top, we had a 360-degree view of everything around us. The east (first panoramic photo below), the north (second), and the south and west (third).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(50)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(56)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(55)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather was pretty warm with only a few clouds when we started. But, there was a strong wind at the top. The wind had pulled in the clouds (and later on rain), so a lot of the view was covered. We could still see Toyama to the north, though not a lot of detail. To the south, we saw an area that had to be Takayama. We couldn't confirm it, but it couldn't have been anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't really cold up there, but the wind was pretty strong. My hat blew clear off my head!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the south-west was a Taishido &lt;span class='ja'&gt;太子堂&lt;/span&gt;, a small buddhist shrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(74)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many buddhist monks hike the mountain to pray here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other notable location at the peak is a pond to the east. The trail maps said it would take about 25 minutes to get there (and another 25 minutes to get back), but looking at the time, we could not afford to go. We needed to get out of the mountains by sundown (5pm-ish), and we were getting close to that limit with the amount of time it would take to descend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Descent&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left the summit before 2pm and took the paved road all the way down. At the top, the paved road began on a disheveled cracked helicopter pad. Moving down the road, some of it had been completely broken apart and ground into rock, but I think a car could still drive across it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, going down the mountain is way more easy than going up. After about an hour, we made it back to the trail head for the detour. We decided to stay on the road this time, and go through construction. We knew how steep and hard the trail would be, and the construction and landslide couldn't be THAT bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(85)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, we were right. The construction and road repair was already complete. If the gate had been opened at the campsite, we could've driven this whole distance. The construction sign we found a little bit later indicated that the road would be open on October 20th, so maybe they still needed to test their repair, or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This road led off in the opposite direction before meeting back to where the detour began. Going down, it took us 45 minutes from where the trail head ended to where it began. This was the same time it took us to climb up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it went off into another part of the mountain, I started noticing a lot of vines choking and strangling the trees and brush on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(89)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so thick. Nothing our size would be able to move through it. Everything was covered with this vine. My friend mentioned that it was probably all one organism, too, that just continued to grow and grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually we made it through the thicket. We reached the start of the trail head and made it to camp, a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(100)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going down the mountain is a bit easier, but the constant stamping of feet on pavement takes it toll on the soles of feet and the hip. But! We arrived and were finally able to refill our water. Another hour of driving through the windy roads, and we were back to civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had a been a while since I had been on a hike, and this one turned into one of the longest hikes I've done in Hida. Much like a marathon, you often question why you ever decided to do it not long after beginning. But you move past that feeling and start enjoying the moment, the movement, the nature, and accomplishment.

Despite traveling through the area numerous times throughout the last 10 years, I've never noticed this structure perched on the hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(22)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After parking at the Sarukura Forest Park alongside several barbecue bits, you are presented with 440 steps that ascend to an altitude of 345 meters. It takes about 10 minutes, which isn't so bad unless you aren't prepared for it. As you reach the top, you'll find the wind castle, pictured above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the summit of Sarukura Mountain &lt;span class='ja'&gt;猿倉山&lt;/span&gt;, and from the observation deck, you can see all the way to Toyama Bay on a clear day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a bunch of photos and put them together into a huge panoramic shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi-Res Panoramic: /wind_castle_panoramic_hi.png (186.5mb)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see nearly all of Toyama, and there is a free-to-use binocular scope so you see the airport, sports arena, and other areas in clear view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, around 1558 to 1570, the summit of Sarukura Mountain was the site of the Sarukura Castle &lt;span class='ja'&gt;猿倉城&lt;/span&gt;, but nothing remains today. The military commander at the time was under the command of the ruler of the Hida region to the south. Hida is surrounded by mountains, so there are very few ways of getting up there. This castle was built to monitor any large armies that may be headed up the mountain to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(14)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This path can be clearly seen today in the above panoramic. There's an incredible clear view of Hwy 41 coming down from Hida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still completely baffles me that I never noticed this place before. Although, I think it's easy to see why I hadn't noticed it before. On my way back home up to Hida, I took some reverse photos looking back at the mountain and the castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(28)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(30)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white castle blends into the sky very easily. If you didn't know it was there, you would never notice it. But, once you know that it's there and where to look, it pops out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also not a whole lot of information about the Wind Castle online. In fact, my friend and I only found this thing by skimming around Toyama in Google Maps looking for something to do. I wanted to know exactly when they built this thing, and its purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a plaque on the Wind Caste which states the following: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;平成&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年度&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;I&gt;Heisei-2 (or 1990)&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;中部通商産業局&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;地域エネルギー開発利用発電モデル事業&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;I&gt;Chubu Bureau of International Trade and Industry Regional Energy Development Utilization Power Generation Model Project&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;「風の城&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;風力エネルギー開発利用事業」&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;I&gt;"The Wind Castle - Wind Energy Development Utilization Project"&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;span class='ja'&gt;富山県大沢野町&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;I&gt;- Osawano Town, Toyama Prefecture.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a mouthful. Seems like it was built in 1990, although I wanted to find more substantial information online. Eventually I did find a blog post of someone talking about Sarukura castle (explained earlier), and a few other things. In particular, in 1975, as part of Toyama prefecture's 100th year anniversary, a 9.6km trail was opened from Mt. Sarukura to Mt. Kosami Gozen &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小佐波御前山&lt;/span&gt;. It didn't mention anything about the Wind Castle at that time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't find anything that confirmed its opening in 1990. But, it was probably built in 1990 as its architecture and flashy nature seems to fit that time well. Like everything built during the economic high times of the 80s and 90s in Japan, it is definitely showing wear and tear from the years. Some of the windows have been kicked out, and the metal railing has graffiti almost everywhere. One of the door had been kicked in, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've never been, I would absolutely recommend driving up here if you're going to or from Toyama. I will probably return here each time I visit Toyama now. Different weather, different season, and different time of day will all create a new view. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/wind-castle</link></item><item><title>Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Recommended as one of the best (or, at least, most significant) ramen restaurants in Toyama, my friend and I went to the original Nishi-cho Taiki location as he continued his month-long vacation in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traveling to all corners of Japan, my friend had a list of all the best ramen in each city and region. Toyama only one on the list, &lt;b&gt;Nishi-cho Taiki&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have expanded to three locations in their near 80 years of business, but my friend and I visited the original location. It is a small hole-in-the-wall kinda place near the main shopping area of downtown Toyama. It's also across the street from Toyama's Glass museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(0)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5077.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5077_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5077_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5077_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(1)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5079.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5079_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5079_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5079_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably couldn't even tell it was there unless you knew what you were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside is a thin row of seats with a minimal amount of decoration. Like most traditional ramen places, it was built for speed and efficiency.  Get in, eat, and get out. The other locations look much more spread-out and modern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signature dish of Nishi-cho Taiki is their Chukka Soba &lt;span class='ja'&gt;中華そば&lt;/span&gt;. At this location, the standard sized bowl was 950&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(4)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5084.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5084_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5084_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5084_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Nishi-cho Taiki established the Toyama-style of Black Ramen with its thick fatty noodles, heavy soy-sauce flavored broth, and numerous amounts of toppings. Taiki's ramen has Chashu (pork), onions, and pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is piled on top, and as indicated by the waitress, you should mix it around a bit before digging in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(5)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5088.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5088_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5088_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5088_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(6)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5090.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5090_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5090_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/IMG_5090_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I've had such heavy meaty ramen. I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen. I wouldn't put it very high of a pantheon of ramen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about the restaurant on their website: &lt;a href="http://www.nisicho-taiki.com/" title="http://www.nisicho-taiki.com/"&gt;http://www.nisicho-taiki.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, here's a scan of their pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(10)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/nishi-cho-taiki</link></item><item><title>Pokemon Go Raid Counters (updated)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have updated my the codebase for my Raid Counter lists in Pokemon Go. Overall, the calculation method are still based on Gamepress's &lt;a href="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet" title="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet"&gt;Comprehensive DPS Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, but now I'm pulling my data from Poke_Miner's &lt;a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters"&gt;Game Master&lt;/a&gt; file, and also updated the UI to be more visually appealing and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter"&gt;&lt;b&gt;List of General Raid Counters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are two others pages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom"&gt;Personal Raid Counter List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; —  I made a page that uses Pokemon in my game to determine whether or not I can defeat the raid boss using just my two accounts. It's not up to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top"&gt;Top Counters per Pokemon Type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; —  Another page compares Pokemon of each type against a generic Arceus to see which is strongest within each type, and overall. It's up to date, but I haven't focused on readability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Purpose&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of these pages is to determine which Pokemon are the strongest against Pokemon that appear as raid bosses. It's very helpful to understand which Pokemon are worth catching and leveling to take down these bosses easily. While they almost always can't be defeated with just one person, every bit helps to defeat them with the fewest amount of people as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many sites that focus of Pokemon Go offer lists of the best pokemon, but never with enough detail to understand why they're the best and never on a single page with all bosses available in the game. Gamepress's DPS page is a great resource to see how much more powerful one pokemon is than another, but you have to manually search and filter everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, I first made this page. At the time, it was use the outputted data from Gamepress to create the page. Whenever there was an update, it would take a LOONGG time to redownload everything. So, last year, I rewrote the backend to do all the calculations itself using the same method as Gamepress. There's more information about here on the previous Project post: &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old" title="/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old"&gt;Previous Post from 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Update&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I liked my previous page, but it was unreadable to anyone else. Also, Gamepress almost never updates its backend data, which my page relied on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this update does two things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I'm using Poke_Miner's &lt;a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters"&gt;Game Master&lt;/a&gt; file in Github to get my updates of Pokemon and Moves. This gets updated much more frequently when stuff changes in the game. (At least, I think it does.) Going along with this, all Pokemon data and moves are stored in the database, which makes it MUCH easier to change manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, I updated the UI. Only I could read it before. Now, I added labels on the numbers, and added images of the Pokemon and more colors, too. The Pokemon images really really pop, and make it super easy to scan the lists. I also added rounded corners, because Fuck yeah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Further Updates&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not completely happy with a lot of the white-on-white text, so I need to fix that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, one of my users complained that he still didn't understand anything, so I was thinking of making pages for each raid boss that showed more detail, such as which moves were available, and pokemon types and weaknesses. I'll get to that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/pokemon-go-raid-counters</link></item><item><title>Fixing and Modding a PS4 Controller</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Through trying to mod my Playstation Classic, I noticed that the triangle button on my PS4 controller didn't work. Some of the other inputs seemed sticky, too. Searching for troubleshooting methods online, one video suggested taking the controller apart to give it a good clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran through the cleaning procedure, but it was still broken. Such an annoying shame. However, the video mentioned that the button membranes or the button cable ribbon could be damaged. They were pretty cheap on Amazon! Only $3 for replacement membranes and $5 for a new cable ribbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Fixing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They arrived pretty quickly, so I ran a stream where I tried to fix my controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSA6RM1V_jI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success!  I was really surprised that it worked so flawlessly so easily. These controllers cost $60 new, so I think it's pretty amazing how a simple $5 part could completely fix it. I wonder how many people throw their controller away or sell it as junk online just because of a problem that a simple $3 or $5 part could fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, fixing this thing was easy. What else could we do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Modding&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking out the buttons is extraordinary simple. They're just plastic pieces siting in a plastic shell. The rubber membranes and cable ribbon underneath do the real work of detecting the button presses. You could put anything on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found some pretty blue buttons on Amazon that would look nice with the white controller, so I ran another stream where I attempted to replace those buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dD73shUj-uo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned on the stream, there was a bit of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all Playstation 4 controllers are created equal. There have been a few revisions over the years. Of course, I knew this from having to buy the correct button cable film from before, and also noticed that the trigger membranes were different. But, I didn't pay attention when buying the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the buttons are nearly identical across all revisions, the R2 and L2 triggers are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(11)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(12)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my earlier revision of the controller, the tension and knock back is caused by a spring loaded wire that sits in a pathway on the inner left side of the button. The later revision does something else and has a much longer clip that prevents the button from getting ripped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(20)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3654.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3654_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3654_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3654_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think the controller looks better than before, but the R2 L2 buttons are still black. Also, the touch pad and home button are also black. It wasn't a complete conversion to blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Modding, again&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a complete set of buttons for my controller wasn't easy, but they did exist on AliExpress. And for only $3.  There was no way I was going to find a set of buttons with the exact Blue color, but I could find a full set of White buttons that matched the color of the controller. In the end, only a few buttons could be blue and they would really stand out. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, I streamed the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PAGyqHwjAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;..and once again not everything was perfect. The white of the buttons was not the exact same color white as the controller. It was more of a warm white, rather than a slate white. Also, the R2 and L2 buttons were closer, but not exact, so they could not be used. R1 and L1 were also wrong. Replacing the touch pad is more involved than it initially looked, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many problems, but it wasn't all a waste.  The Home, Share, and Options are the same across all model of controllers, so they fit. And the slight difference in color isn't TOO noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(30)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not a perfect match, I think it looks better than before. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of the face buttons and sticks popping out from the contrast and all the secondary buttons fading into the color of the controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Continuing…&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, I'm going to call this closed. It'll take a bit of searching to try and find the exact colors I want for my model of controller.  More money, more time, more hassle. It's 90% of the way there, and that's good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main goal was fixing the controller in the first place, and even more so, I now have an excellent controller to use for the Switch. I bought an 8bitdo wireless adapter for the modded Playstation Classic, which I had given up on. Using it on the Switch instead, the PS4 controller works amazing. It is a far more comfortable controller to use than the Joy-cons.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller</link></item><item><title>Top 20 Music Tracks</title><description>&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, I came across a post that I could not stop thinking about.

Also, the balance very heavy on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I loved that Lego Bonsai Tree so much, I had bought a second one for cheap on Yahoo Auctions to make a slightly larger bonsai tree. So, rather than doing that, I could build it as normal and place it on the right side of the garden giving the scene more balance through framing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Building a Second Bonsai Tree&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only took me an hour to put the set together, which is twice as fast as my previous build. Of course, this time I wasn't building to an audience on Twitch, and I had already done it before, so that accounted for the speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two things that were different this time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The feet were different?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first difference was the &lt;b&gt;feet for the base&lt;/b&gt;. These feet were constructed using a 2x2 plate with a bottom technic pin, a technic tube, and a rubber something that went on the tube. These parts were totally different than my other Bonsai Tree and even the Tranquil Garden. The original set were made using a 2x2 plate with a bottom tire peg and a rubber tire. You can see the difference in the right photo below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(5)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" /&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(7)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" /&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know why this is different, but you really can't tell in the finished design and it works the same way. I haven't looked into it, but maybe the Chinese version uses the cheaper parts? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Balance Mod&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I built my first bonsai tree, I used a building mod that claimed to make a more balanced tree, and overall it did. The main branch went down the center of the tree, and two other shorter branches were on both sides. I started doing the same mod to this tree. But after building it, I decided to change. Not all trees have the same shape, so I thought it would look more natural if the trees looked different. I took it apart and went with the standard build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(12)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576.webp" /&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(16)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582.webp" /&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original design (on the right) is really weird. Nature does have a lot of randomness, but there's still a balance to it. However, there is not a stiff coordinated balance like the mod. Maybe there's a nice in-between, but whatever. In the end, it results in a different tree, as you'd expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(24)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its own, the modded balanced tree looks way better just by itself. The unmodified tree on the left feels like it's missing a patch on the right side. But that's okay because it's just one piece of the overall scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Branch Blending&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cherry blossom leaves of the Bonsai Tree and Tranquil Garden are similar, but not the same. Both have white leaves, although they're different pieces. Both use magenta flowers with stud pegs. But for pink flowers, the Bonsai tree uses frogs and the Garden uses stud flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted all the leaves of the cherry blossom trees to be more uniform, which meant sharing pieces across all of the leaves. The magenta pieces were fine, but the pink pieces were heavy on the Bonsai tree, light on the Garden trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing some math, each Bonsai tree has 20 leaves for its tree. The Garden trees have a total of 17. In total, 57 leaves across the three sets. Each Bonsai leaf had 5 frogs, for a total of 200 pink frogs across both sets. That means each leaf should have 3.5 frogs. Each Garden leaf had 4 small flowers, for a total of 58 flower pieces. Easy. Each leaf should have one flower peg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started taking things apart and moving pieces around, and in the end, things looked much better than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(28)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Garden trees still look a little sparse. But, that's because the leaves are spread apart more than the Bonsai tree. Outside of other mods, you can't really help it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Light Kit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I bought the second Bonsai tree, I also bought a second light kit. Having installed one previously, it was WAYY easier to put together this time. I knew exactly how I was going to hook everything up and it all came together pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it came together quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(39)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Bonsai trees bookend the Tranquil Garden perfectly and create a scene with the tea house slightly peering through the white and pink branches. I ended up switching the position of the Bonsai trees because of the empty patch of the unmodified tree fits well next to the trees from the Garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks great during the day with natural light, and looks great at night with the LEDs flipped on. The photo is a little blown out so it makes the LEDs look brighter than the are, but it looks great in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only problem is how dim the Garden looks compared to the tree. Again, in person, it's not as bad as the photo, but it's still dark. Maybe I'll look into the LED set for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I'm really happy how it turned out. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/completing-lego-bonsai-garden</link></item><item><title>Final Fantasy XVI</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy XVI is an excellent game with a lot of troubling bits around the outside. It has an expansive story between kingdoms and magic that spans 20 years with an incredibly satisfying end, but I think it fumbles some aspects that the Final Fantasy franchise prides itself upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The World of Valisthea&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy XVI is set on the continents of Valisthea, which is divided between six nations in the beginning. Nations engage in war and alliances between each other to either preserve peace or expand their empire. A ravaging blight that spreads across areas of the continents forces these nations into cooperation or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(158)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each kingdom's capital is built at the seat of a towering mother crystal. From mining the crystal, people are able to channel magic used for filling wells with water, or lighting fires used for cooking, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a subset of humans known as bearers who are able to channel magical powers without the aid of crystals. Within the world, the general population considers bearers sub-human and treats them as slaves. Bearers are sold and used as tools for villages and armies and are often abused and lynched by their masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very few select bearers are more than simple magic users, they are dominants. Dominants can channel divine beings known as Eikons (or Summons, in previous games). These Eikons are the embodiment of a magical alignment and are massive creatures that can easily destroy armies and cities with a single movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(71)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a few dominants are known at the beginning of the story, but there are a total of 8. Many of the kingdoms of Valiesthea have at least one among their ranks. Battles between nation's Eikons are rare as they are considered the nuclear option. If one nation began using its dominant to attack another, that nation would have to respond and would result in extensive losses on both sides. Plus, allied nations would have to respond as well. There is always a thin balance of peace and war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many kingdoms view dominants as divine humans and many dominants are part of the royal bloodline of the ruling class, but others view them as demons. A single human should not have control over power great enough to rip the world apart. One nation, The Iron Kingdom, regards them as abominations and puts any child to death that could possibly become a dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloth Map Scan: /ffxvi_cloth_map.png (205.9mb)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is the world of Final Fantasy XVI at the beginning of the game. The Deluxe Edition of the game came with a cloth map of the world that I scanned and included above. The five mother crystals are pretty easy to see. The castle and capitol of each kingdom lies at the base of the crystal, with the exception of the red crystal to the west. It sits on an island between the Iron Kingdom in the southwest, and Rosaria on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, there used to be a sixth crystal in the north which had its own kingdom. But the blight engulfed its land destroying the crystal, and completely severing the nation from its resources. All of the brown swaths across the map are areas ravaged by the blight, no longer able to sustain any life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Characters&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of FFXVI focuses on Clive Rosfield, the prince of Rosaria. Clive is the firstborn son of the king, Elwin Rosfield, and has a younger brother, Joshua. Clive attempted the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, but failed, so his mother, Annabella, rejects him for Joshua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the collapse of the northern kingdom, they attempted to invade Rosaria, but failed. To ensure peace with the remains of the north, the Rosfields took the princess, Jill Warrick, as ward. After the complete dissolution of the north, Jill remained in Rosaria and became like a sister to Clive and Joshua. They also have a dog, Torgal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(12)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Story - The Beginning&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Clive is a teenager and Joshua and Jill are still children. The Iron Kingdom is moving against Rosaria, so the Duke of Rosaria, Elwin Rosfield, father to Clive and Joshua, moves to attack them. Joshua had successfully completed the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, so Elwin brings him to the battle as a backup plan. Clive is Joshua's sworn Shield (protector), so he goes, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They travel to Phoenix Gate to prepare their battle plans, but their army is secretly attacked and killed in the night. Annabella betrays them and led the rival nation of Sanbreque to their location. Elwin Rosfield is killed, and Joshua awakens as the Phoenix. Another figure appears as awakens as a second Dominant of Fire, Ifrit. They battle, and the Phoenix is killed. Clive is taken by the Sanbreque army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(69)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The Good&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World and the Story of Final Fantasy XVI are the best aspects of the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lore has been well thought out, and the general themes of Final Fantasy have been woven into the fabric of that lore. The conflicts between each country and people make sense and build the relationships between all of the characters in the game. The story takes a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones, not only in its world building, but its adult story, too. People are killed in often brutal unexpected methods, including main characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is a little complicated, but the game has ample resources for you to keep up with the story and understand what's going on. There are two characters in your hideout that help you with this. One character shows the current political map both from the relationships between characters to the actual world map. Another character writes entries in his library about everything you encounter. Also, during action sequences, you can pull up "active lore" that shows all the information that led to the moment you're experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(271)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" &gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The Story - Continued&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 years pass, and Clive is a slave in the Sanbreque army. He vows revenge against his mother and against the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. During a battle between Dhalmekia and the Iron Kingdom, Clive finds Jill being used by the Iron Kingdom to wage war. He's ordered to kill Jill, but he kills his squad mates and the soldiers holding her captive instead, and they attempt to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cid, an outlaw who gives protection to bearers and dominants, finds them and rescues them from the battle. Cid's dream is to create a world where all mankind can be free. No one would keep another as a slave, nor look down on them as being different.  Clive agrees to help Cid find and free more bearers that have been enslaved and used by the kingdoms of Valisthea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they travel, they are attacked by Benedikta, the Dominant of Wind. As they battle, Clive pushes his use of magic passed his limits and transforms into Ifrit to defeat her. Clive realizes that he was the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. After the battle, he accepts what he has done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clive and Jill join Cid's group of outlaws to bring their idea of the peace to the world. Ultimately, in order to accomplish, Cid says that they must destroy the mother crystals. They infiltrate Sanbreque, and destroy their first mother crystal, but (&lt;I&gt;spoiler&lt;/I&gt;) Cid is killed in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(96)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cid gone, Clive takes the mantle of Cid, and for the next 7 years, they continue to free slaves and help everyone they can. Ultimately, they continue Cid's quest to destroy every mother crystal in Valisthea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The Bad&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characters and Story are the backbone of every Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy XVI excels at its expansive, well-thought-out story, but it focuses on a single point, Clive. The whole game revolves around Clive as the central figure responsible for nearly everything that happens in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, it seemed like all the kingdom and characters had agency in how the story and world was shaped.  But, after the second time skip to 20 years after the story began, all the other characters are mostly sitting by, idle, until Clive confronts them on his quest to destroy all the mother crystals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gameplay is an extension of this as you only ever play as Clive. Perhaps the most controversial change from the Final Fantasy formula was making this more of a single character action game. Final Fantasy used to be the premiere Japanese RPG, where you control a party of characters who excel at magic and weapons. Final Fantasy VII Remake did an excellent job of adding modern action elements while still allowing you control multiple characters and balance your party. In Final Fantasy XVI, you get in a battle and just hack and slash to win. There's a little more than that, but every battle is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Clive is such a focus in the story and gameplay, other characters get pushed into the background and out of sight. Even if other characters are with you, you almost never really notice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(105)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill is an amazing character, and watching Clive and Jill's relationship grow over the course of the game is one of the highlights for me. But, once their relationship hits their peak and they admit and express their love for each other, Jill is pushed off to the side. She hangs back on the ship while you go into the next battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this happens with most other characters in the game, it especially happens with all the women. Because Clive in the main focus of everything in the game, it pushes the masculine attitude that everything in the man's responsibility and everything must be done by the man, which is somewhat troubling given Final Fantasy's history of strong female characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game does often recognize this, though, as characters will occasionally tell Clive that saving their world is everyone's responsibility, not just his. But, it is brushed off and forgotten as he continues to kill the next boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The Music&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is another weak part of Final Fantasy XVI.  Final Fantasy prides itself on all of the music through the franchise, and even makes rhythm games to relive classic moments of your favorite games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much of the music from Final Fantasy XVI is forgettable. There are no strong melodic themes between all of the tracks, and often many of the songs are derivative of previous Final Fantasy music. It all sounds like filler music. There's no identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I almost never pay attention to the background music when playing the game. And now listening to the soundtrack on my computer, I find myself skipping many of the songs to try and find something interesting. No one is going to play these songs in Theatrhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The Graphics, Art, and Performance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the positives, the game looks absolutely stunning and plays like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(252)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is pretty repetitive, but there is no point of any input lag between what I'm doing in battle. I'm always able to switch around to the skills that I want to use and evade when an attack is incoming.  Any time I get hit is because of my own screw up. Switching to Performance mode, the game doesn't keep a consistent 60 fps, but it's still quite fluid. Also, loading between scenes takes no more than 2 seconds. It's almost instant between changes map locations or starting a dialogue scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the art direction is excellent, too, with creative and diverse kingdoms with sweeping landscapes. Although, many of the colors are very unsaturated. The world looks very drull and shabby. Many sequences are very dimly lit, too, making everything very dark. This is obviously the image they were going for, and it matches well with the story, but it doesn't make it very scenic. Also, halfway through the game, a spell is cast which darkens the skies and puts a purple hue on everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The End - Ultima&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(302)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Spoilers&lt;/I&gt; After destroying the first mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima reveals himself to you. Ultima is an unworldly mysterious figure who attempts to possess you, but is thwarted by Joshua, who is actually alive. As you take over Cid's quest and destroy crystal after crystal, Ultima's intentions reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultima is of a race of beings that existed long before humanity. The beings all had individual bodies, but shared a single consciousness. Together, they were all known as Ultima.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Ultima create magic, and with magic, life was created as well. Life flourished throughout the world, but a darkness was also born to balance the forces of nature. This darkness grew, consumed life, and Ultima could not stop its advancement. This was the blight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blight was unstoppable and Ultima had no means of saving their world. So, in order to survive, they had to create a new world where their lives could be born and grown again. To create a new world, they first had to find a land that was pure and untouched by the blight. This was impossible in their physical bodies, so they shed their corporeal forms to become a singular spirit. Then, they were able to find the pure lands of ancient Valisthea, rich in the life force known as Aether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being only spirit, Ultima had to plant the seeds of what they would become. They created the mother crystals in order to collect and channel the aether of Valisthea. And secondly, they created humanity. Over time, as humanity matured, they would be able to harness the power of the aether from the crystals. Each crystal bore a different tribe and different magic. One day, there would a single person who would be able to wield all of the magic. And this would be the person that Ultima had waited for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to receive all of the aether inside of himself, Ultima could possess this person and cast a spell that would bring them back to physical life in the world and paradise they had created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the world created, Ultima went to sleep and waited for the day when this person would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The End - Humanity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(65)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From humanity's perspective, God had abandoned them. And without God to shape their morality and purpose, man had to find their own purpose. Some men desired power and used magic in order to claim it. Powerful men then led their nations in wars against each other in order to keep and expand their power. And with the overuse of magic, the blight had begun to form in Valisthea. Humanity now had its own purpose and will of their own, and God / Ultima was forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Clive's destruction of the mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima had awaken to see that humanity had spun away from their purpose, his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to steal and absorb the magical essence of others, Clive was the person that Ultima was waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Fate had given Clive the ultimate power, it had also given Clive a torturous life of rejection and pain. Ultima needed Clive to give himself completely to Ultima in order for Ultima to become alive again.  But, with every obstacle in Clive's life, every death, every defeat, every failure, Clive continued for himself and the others in his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanity was its own being, it was no longer Ultima's to command. Creation of life does not serve as ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So through the final battle, Clive finally punches God hard enough in the face, and God submits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(309)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clive absorbs the power from Ultima eradicating him and casts a spell that would remove all magic from the world, which ultimately stops the blight. By casting such a powerful spell, it's implied that Clive uses all the aether from within him and is turned to stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millenia later, humanity lives on with the lives of Clive, Joshua, and the others becoming stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Ending&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its overall problems, this is the most well told Final Fantasy to date. It has an incredible story and very strong characters of Clive and Ultima. Because of the story, it makes sense that everything is funneled into a singular main character, and that everything is very linear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it's unfortunate that many other characters get shuffled off to the side. I think the story probably could have been reworked to give those characters more of a spotlight and perhaps made a party of characters. And having a more traditional party could have resulted in more interesting management of equipment and items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, would the game really have been better as a result? The story probably would have suffered, and they wouldn't have been able to completely tell the story that they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not perfect, but not every Final Fantasy has to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest problem with the previous game, Final Fantasy XV, was not having an overall vision from the beginning and trying to balance too many ideas at once. There was a lot of good with Final Fantasy XV, but that game was broken for a long time, and many of the story sequences are still not quite consistent after all the updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy XVI solved all those problems and created a very specific experience that is technologically sound and fantastic. The lows aren't too bad, and the highs are incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think it's excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(292)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/final-fantasy-xvi</link></item><item><title>Lego Tranquil Garden</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Lego has expanded its line of brick building models to a more adult audience, not just adult collectors. In 2021, they released the &lt;a href="/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree"&gt;Lego Bonsai Tree&lt;/a&gt;, the first in its new line of botanical sets which tried to remove as much of the Lego authentic as possible. From a distance, you could barely tell the flowers or trees were Lego. With its huge success, Lego continued to release more botanical sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going into this summer, they announced their new sets, one of which was the Lego Tranquil Garden. This set attempted to replicate the scene of a Japanese garden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(59)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hearing about the Tranquil Garden, I was really looking forward to it. It wasn't TOOO expensive at $110, and it looked like the perfect companion set to the &lt;a href="/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree"&gt;Bonsai tree&lt;/a&gt;, a set that I put together a few months ago, and absolutely love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tranquil Garden came out on August 1st, and I bought it directly from Lego.com. 2 weeks later, when I finally had time away from work, I fired up the Twitch stream, and put it together with some folks watching. Overall, it took about 5 hours to put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKXRBkliKpc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a huge Lego person (really I'm not), but this set was an absolute joy to put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tea house was a pretty standard short build that used a lot of unique parts to complete the Japanese aesthetic, but the real amazing part was building the base. It was fun trying to figure out where the pond, path, bridge, and house were supposed to go in the end while building it up from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(5)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(7)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some YouTubers complained about the annoying correctness of having to place all the translucent blue water tiles, but it felt more like a puzzle to me. I think the Lego brand is so strong because creative people can take a set and build whatever they want and people looking for a more structured experience can follow the instructions to put the model together perfectly. Even in both cases, there's room to go the other way and build what you really want in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the final rock pieces added on the edge of the pond, 1x1 struts were created to support the tea house, and then it's connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(11)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(15)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final part of the model created 6 interchangeable mostly tree modules for the 6 squares in the base. There were two somewhat sparse cherry blossom trees, a pine tree, some bamboo shoots, a small tree, and a stone lantern-like structure. The pine tree was really fragile, so I shoved an extra red bar down the center for stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the elements completed, the set really comes alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(18)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the angled rocks and other curved building techniques, it doesn't immediately scream Lego. Although, those seams start showing when you get up close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is built at mini-figure scale, so if you do collect other lego sets, you can have some figures walking around. To clash with the tranquility of nature, I bought a custom, somewhat creepy looking Joker figure from Yahoo Auctions. And, I bought a Batman keychain with my Lego.com order. At a distance, both figures kind of blend into the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(29)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(33)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(40)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved how this set turned out, and it looks great next to the Bonsai tree. The bases are built the exact same way with the exact same pieces, so they really are the perfect companion sets with each other. With a little modification of moving around some frogs, it will look even more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a second Bonsai tree not that long ago, and I think it would be perfect to place on the other side of the model. I'll put that together at some point and complete the scene on my shelf. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/lego-tranquil-garden</link></item><item><title>Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Takayama is a city surrounded by mountains and nature. These mountains lead to excellent vantage points of the city, but all have their own history, too. The southwest mountains of Matsukura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松倉&lt;/span&gt; and Harayama &lt;span class='ja'&gt;原山&lt;/span&gt; used to be the center point of the ruling class of the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Matsukura Castle &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松倉城&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1500s, Hida was its own province amongst the warring states, and the rulers were the Anekouji Clan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;姉小路&lt;/span&gt;. Takayama was the most prosperous area of Hida because it was the most open. Farmers could easily till the land and feed all of its people. There was plenty of roam to rear livestock, such as horses and cows. And, Hida was also known for its expert carpenters. The mountain of Matsukura overlooked the entirety of Takayama, so it was the perfect point to build a stronghold to defend the city. This was Matsukura Castle &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松倉城&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the 1500s, Oda Nobunaga &lt;span class='ja'&gt;織田信長&lt;/span&gt; had begun his conquest of defeating all independent clan and armies and unifying Japan as a single country. In 1585, he dispatched Kanamori Nagachika &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近&lt;/span&gt; to ascend the mountains of Hida and destroy the Anekouji Clan to claim the territory. The Anekouji Clan was easily outmatched, defeated, and killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Hida and Takayama under the control of Nobunaga through Kanamori, peace came to the city, and Kanamori transformed the city into a vacation town for his rich friends.

Can you find these locations, too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With both views from Matsukura and Harayama combined, you're able to see about 65% of Takayama. The southern neighborhoods are obstructed by trees, and the eastern neighborhoods are behind the short mountains that cut through downtown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Matsukura Kannon &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松倉観音&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, in 1585, the Kanamori clan, led by Kanamori Nagachika &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近&lt;/span&gt;, took control of the Hida province and stationed themselves in Takayama.  After 108 years and 5 generations, Kanamori Yoritoki &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森頼旹&lt;/span&gt; was the current head of the clan. He was a troublesome child and leader, so the entire clan was removed from the Hida province in 1692 and transferred to modern day Yamagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a buddhist monk named Tenden Koutou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;天電高幢&lt;/span&gt; returned from his position at the Sennyu-ji Temple &lt;span class='ja'&gt;泉涌寺&lt;/span&gt; in Kyoto, and built a shrine to Kannon in a cave of Matsukura mountain. This shrine is called a Fumonin &lt;span class='ja'&gt;普門院&lt;/span&gt;, an official branch of temples across Japan that pray to the buddhist God, Kannon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(9)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kannon is a deity in Buddhism that grants people deliverance from suffering. People will often pray to Kannon for protection from illness and prosperity for their family and livelihood. Kannon has six transformations, and the Matsukura Kannon Temple specifically prays to the Bato Kannon transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bato Kannon is the more violent and warlike transformation, characterized by a menacing horse head. Horses were a very important animal and symbol of old Hida. There were used for farming, transportation, and many people considered them members of their family. People from Hida and even further would travel with their horses to the temple on July 9th every year, to pray for the wellbeing and protection of their horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Ema &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬&lt;/span&gt; and Emaichi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬市&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling up the mountain isn't so difficult today, but this was not the case 400 years ago. It caused a lot of stress for the horse. So, artists began painting horses on paper and selling them in downtown Takayama. These horse paintings were called Ema &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬&lt;/span&gt;, which literally translates to Horse Painting. Emaichi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬市&lt;/span&gt; means Horse Painting Market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this market, farmers would buy whichever horse painting they thought looked most like their horse. Then, they would bring this painting up the mountain to the Matsukura temple instead of their actual horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this painted horse became a symbol for more than just their horse. Because a family would rely on their horse for their farm, the horse painting now encompassed a person's entire farm or business. Families also consider their horse a member of their family, so the horse painting protection began to expand to other members of the family, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Modern Day Emaichi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, the tradition continues. Almost every business throughout Hida (and most residences, too) will have a horse painting at the entrance. Pointed inward, the horse painting offers protection and prosperity for the business or family inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year on August 9th and 10th, the Bato Kannon deity is moved from the main Kannon temple in downtown Takayama into the Matsukura mountain. At this time, horse paintings are created for anyone that comes to visit and a Buddhist monk of the Kannon temple will infuse his prayer into the painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings"&gt;8 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I came here for the first time after finally learning about the origins of the horse paintings that I saw everywhere. People get a fresh horse painting every year to renew their protection and luck, but I think it worked out pretty well for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year was the first time the Emaichi was held in person since Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(33)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited the temple during the day to get some order forms. I was planning on getting several horse paintings for other people, so I wanted to get information on size and price, and figure out what to do later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I returned to the temple to get the paintings made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Matsukura temple isn't very difficult to get to, but it's a little more difficult at night when there is no natural light at all. It's about a kilometer drive up the mountain, and then another kilometer by foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference of night and day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(14)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6074.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6074_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6074_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6074_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(34)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6114.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6114_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6114_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6114_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen lights were strung along the one kilometer stretch from my car to the temple, but a flashlight was necessary both to be able to find the way and for general protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I parked around 8:45pm at the open area near the summit, and made it to the temple about 20 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(47)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6323.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6323_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6323_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(50)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6332.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6332_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6332_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6332_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was perhaps a little overkill, but I ordered 10 Ema paintings this year for various people in my life.

Many fans of both Lego and Playstation praised the set for how authentic it looked to the game source. Modern Lego designers love to use Lego's vast library of pieces and colors in unique ways to create something that looks less and less like Lego each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I had built the Lego Bonsai tree, and absolutely loved it. I'm not really a fan of Lego's aesthetic and blocky models, and both the Bonsai Tree and the Horizon Tallneck sets, as well as many other modern sets, try to hide these features as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(1)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tallneck has so many rounded edges, curved surfaces, and off-angled lines that it looks more like a regular plastic model, rather than a Lego model. Even the joints for each leg have incredible articulation, like an action figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(0)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the set retails for $100, I was able to get a "used" set from Yahoo Auctions for $40. Used means that the set was already opened and built. They were selling it already built, too. But for that price, I could easily disassemble it and build it up again as if it were the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The package was pristine when I received it in the mail and it included almost all of the original empty bags that hold the pieces. It was really easy to take apart and organize into its newly opened state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on May 13th, I streamed myself building it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RckDOp3RbAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was fun putting it together, but I didn't really have the same energy that I had with the Bonsai Tree. Maybe it was because I had already seen it completed, so there weren't any surprises.  But, I don't really like the overall look in person. I feel like it still retains some of that block Lego aesthetic even though they try to hide it as much as possible. It's also really big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, I was planning on modifying the base to add the Bonsai tree to it, but the Tallneck completely towers over the tree. They don't really compliment each other after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had it on my shelf for about a month, but I decided to take it down and take it apart again. You can see this progress in the photos below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(10)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(16)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole process is kind of like taking apart a puzzle after you build it.

If I wanted to make any additions to the set, or use it in some other way, it would always be the center piece. Everything else would have to complement it, rather than creating a balanced scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/lego-horizon-tallneck</link></item><item><title>Showa Hall 昭和館</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Showa Hall is a retro museum in Takayama that focuses on curating artifacts from recent history. Retro museums focus on the era of economic revival of post-war Japan and all of the culture that came from it. Most items are from the 1950s and 1960s. But lately, some of these museums have added things from the 70s and 80s, sometimes even 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love retro museums because it's all history that our modern culture and society have been built upon. You could say that all history has built our modern lives, but recent history of 50 to 60 years is so close that you can easily make those connections to modern day and see how things have changed from not that long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showa Hall was one of the first touristy places I visited in Takayama when I first arrived 10 years ago, and I fell in love with the idea of retro museums. Last week, we had a field trip at school where we walked around town and viewed the town like a tourist, so I returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(85)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Takayama has changed quite a bit in the 10 years I've lived here, the Showa Hall remains almost identical.

The Showa era ended in 1989 and ushered in the Heisei era.  But the 90s are Retro, so it still somewhat makes sense.  Maybe some of the J-pop records from the music store downstairs were already walking that fine line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, I love Retro Showa-era Museums because the history is so close. But it's still history that I never actually lived, so even though it was near history, it was still distant.  The 90s are WAY different because not only had I lived through them before, they're only 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also mentioned above, I revisited the Showa Hall during a school field trip, so they were many students in the museum at the same time, and I was with some teachers, too. One teacher is getting pretty close to 60-years-old, so he lived through the era with many of the items in the museum. He commented how he his school classroom looked identical to the one in the museum, and how he had memorized most of the music in the store from hearing it so many times.  His reaction was much more of a nostalgia trip than a "ugh I'm getting old" feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the 90s gaming stuff is really just tacked on. They aren't trying to recreate a 90s gaming room. They're just displaying a bunch of games and have the mini consoles up. Really low effort. You can get the exact same experience by going to any used game store. Maybe this better explains my apprehension of their 90s gaming display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(1)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Showa Hall is still one of my favorite places in Takayama. Another Retro Museum had also opened in the last 10 years, but it's much more of a circus rather than a caringly curated collection and recreation of the times. I would recommend visiting if you ever come to Takayama. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/showa-hall-2</link></item><item><title>The Last of Us Part 2</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Last of Us 2 continues the story of a post-apocalyptic America.

It also showed us the lengths at which people will go to survive, and fight for their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(4)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230416135926.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230416135926_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230416135926_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230416135926_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last of Us 2 continues 4 years after the ending of Last of Us 1, and its story is no longer about surviving. Joel and Ellie have found their life in Jacksonville, Wyoming with Tommy. Both have built relationships within their community. Ellie has grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last of Us 2 is about revenge. Being hunted because of our past decisions, hunting others because of theirs, and ultimately living with the cost. You play as two characters, Ellie and Abby. Ellie leaves Jacksonville to Seattle in order to hunt down Abby. And Abby tries to make sense of her life and what she believes in as it is taken away from her.

Even though it's still quite linear, there are many places that are open to explore. Every journey from this corner of the city to that corner has weight to it, and it shows how incredibly strong you must be in order to get anywhere. The scale of this game is so impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several real world locations in Seattle were modeled for the game including the Seahawks stadium, the outside of the library, and the Seattle Convention center where PAX West takes place. It would be fun to return to Seattle and compare these locations to their counterparts in the game. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(174)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(182)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the scale is impressive, the length of game is somewhat troublesome. The first game never felt long or exhausting. Some parts took a while, but I never felt like it was taking forever. The Last of Us 2 shows the full breadth of the journey, from the very beginning to the very end and all parts in the middle. Sometimes it'll skip to where you need to do next, but you take the long way around every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, it's hard to fault the game for avoiding shortcuts, telling a complete story, and showing you the full journey. I think The Last of Us 2's biggest strength is its obsessive attention to detail and lack shortcuts in all aspects of the game. It's also its biggest weakness as it makes the game so long. Indulgent or Impressive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess it's a matter of perspective and expectations, though. I knew what to expect from Last of Us 1 and went through it pretty quickly. I had no idea where this game was going to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also insane to me that I was able to buy it for a mere $10 when it feels like the most expensive game ever made. Looking online, apparently it has not come near to breaking even. Which.. given the amount of options people have for entertainment and how people immediately hated the game on its release, makes sense.  I suppose that's why Naughty Dog re-released Last of Us 1 and optioned for the TV Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(215)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the amount of detail, work, and care that went into The Last of Us 2, I think it's hard not to be impressed. I really didn't care much about the first game, but I think the TV show and the sequel really highlight the best parts of the story. I think The Last of Us is something quite special.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/the-last-of-us-part-2</link></item><item><title>Video Game Collection</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing, buying, and collecting video games ever since I was a kid. Over the years, I have amassed quite a collection, and I've always wanted a good way of keeping track of what I have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've made some rudimentary webpages before, but I finally found some inspiration to put together a visual database of my games collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/apps/games" title="/apps/games"&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Games Collection / Database&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="/apps/games" title="/apps/games"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230504_games/IMG_2096.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230504_games/IMG_2096.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230504_games/IMG_2096.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By visiting the above link, you can view lists of all the games I have in my collection. You can click on each Console and Handheld to see a list of all individual games. You can also click on Condition and Region to filter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiration for the layout came from prolific Giant Bomb community member, Brad Lynch, when he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarinoV1/status/1651677046383210515" title="https://twitter.com/MarinoV1/status/1651677046383210515"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; screenshots of spreadsheets cataloguing his own collection. I instantly loved his layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that really puzzled me for a long time was how to include Digital games into my collection. Obviously some games are so incredibly simple, should they be included? 10 years ago, I think that was a difficult question to consider, but now? You can buy every games available on the platform digitally whether it's a full AAA release, indie release, or a simple game release. Using Digital as a condition type is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going a step further, I could also use region to narrow down the version of the game. Including other information, such as Publisher, Developer, and Release Date seemed like a lot of data entry, but it didn't really take all that long to do. I've always been curious which are the most common developer and publishers among my games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these are only all of the games I have with me in Japan. The bulk of my collection is back in America and I won't have access to catalogue it until I return to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, overall, I'm quite happy. Another project marked off of the bucket list as I closed out the the oldest open bug case in my GitHub. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/video-game-collection</link></item><item><title>Toys R Us still exists!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While Bain Capital destroyed Toys R Us in the United States, and shut down all of their stores nearly 5 years ago, Toys R Us in other countries were left untouched. Toys R Us International had separated from its American parent prior to the Bain Capital purchase. So, if you're able to travel abroad, you can still visit one of my favorite stores of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No place is this more true than Toys R Us Asia, the most successful branch of the international division, according to the Internet. In particular in Japan, you can easily find a Toys R Us store in most malls. However, directly north of Nagoya, just south of Komaki, along the road underneath the Nagoya Expressway is a special place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(1)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rare standalone Toys R Us location, outside of the mall and other shopping centers. Here's the location in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/f2tKueDDLrjEzf1SA" title="https://goo.gl/maps/f2tKueDDLrjEzf1SA"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular store is the Toys R Us that time forgot. From the outside to the inside, it's like stepping back through time 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the aisle fixtures and shelving are exactly the same as they were when I worked at Toys R Us from 1997 to 2000. Those fat heavy off-white metal shelves with three teeth that fit into the aisle. That off-white peg board in the back. The plastic covers hooked to the very top shelves for signage and concealing extra product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(4)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(7)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(10)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(14)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though they are painted white, the peg hooks are identical as are all of the price labels on them. The rollers for the diaper rack are identical. Those metal price frames are the same too. The bike racks. The stroller aisle. They even had the old tickets for video game systems!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the prices were printed on white paper instead of yellow. But other than that, it's a near replica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The check out lines were identical too, with the exception of the updated cash registers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(34)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's pretty amazing how everything is still intact like it hadn't been touched in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, of Japan's 150+ Toys R Us locations, 99% of them are located in malls and shopping centers. I'm pretty sure that the mall locations don't have the same shelves and aisle fixtures. At my Toys R Us (25 years ago), each section of the aisle with those shelves were 4 feet across. "Merchandise the aisle 4 feet at a time," the old manager would say. I should have brought a tape measure to check if these shelves were 4 feet, but it definitely seemed like it. Japan uses the metric system, so I'm guessing the locations in the malls use more standard Japanese shelves. They wouldn't have defaulted to 4 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at Google Earth, this Toys R Us was here in 2001, which was back before the International Division broke away from the American parent. Much like Costco does today, they probably manufactured all of these shelves, fixtures, and equipment in America and shipped it overseas. In the last 20 years, there was probably no reason to throw out all of this stuff in order to remodel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This North Nagoya location feels like an island in many ways. It feels like an island in time, obviously. But there's nothing else around the area, either. You HAVE to drive to get here, and specifically drive to this location. With nothing else around, this isn't really an impulse stop. There's plenty of parking. The roof is a parking lot, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my photos, many families still come here looking for toys, bikes, and other baby gear. It took me a while to get some photos without people. Actually, I never took photos of the bike area because there was always someone there. So, this location must still be pretty profitable. Makes sense if they're not actually spending any money updating the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if the trip to this location would actually be worth it, but if you have deep nostalgia for Toys R Us in the 2000s, and you happen to be driving north out of Nagoya, it could be worth a stop. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/toys-r-us-still-exists</link></item><item><title>Lego Bonsai Tree</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Lego released the Bonsai Tree Lego set. This was one of two initial sets in the Botanical Collection, a series of Lego sets meant to show the vibrance and beauty of plant life. One of the goals of Lego has always been to replicate the real world within the constrictions of using Lego bricks. It originally did this as a child's toy, but has expanded year after to include sets specifically designed for adults. Modern adult Lego sets can feel a lot more like building a model, but with the ease and satisfaction of Lego bricks connecting together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been a few years since it was released, but I finally decided to buy it. It retails for $50 in the US, or 6000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; over here. I also bought a lighting kit for $30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bonsai Tree is meant to embody both the beauty and simplicity of an actual bonsai tree. Also, it's meant to give you the creative freedom to mold and modify the tree however you like. Much like how you cut and mold the branches of a real bonsai tree, you can do the same with the Lego tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get you started, the Bonsai Tree set comes with two options. Once you build the trunk of the tree and the branches, you can add on green leaves. This would make it look like a normal bonsai tree. Or, you could add white leaves and pink flowers to make the bonsai tree look like a cherry blossom tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that I wanted to buy this set was seeing the cherry blossom version of the tree online. So, I had to go that route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(5)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(6)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting together the tree was so satisfying. It's really fascinating how far Lego sets have come over the last 40 years. People who work at Lego have grown up with Lego their whole life. They creatively use regular and unique pieces in different ways to create something that you wouldn't have noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would've been so easy for them to make the tree go straight up from the ground, but the base of the tree uses hinges to angle it. Curved pieces are used to make the base of the trunk fatter and hide those hinges. Different colors of brown are used to make the tree look more dynamic and real. Tube pieces are used as main branches. Even both options of green leaves or pink flowers have different pieces and techniques to make the tree look different, and more like the actual tree they're trying to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that modern Lego LOVES to do is is hide all of their signature studs with smooth bricks. It turns the overall piece into something more like a model. Overall, it creates a very striking piece for your shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before building the set, I looked online for ways on how people were modding their trees. Lots of people had very dynamic changes with colors and leaves. The booklet had some interesting ideas, too. On &lt;a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-76280/SFH_Bricks/10281-bonsai-tree-branch-rebuild/" title="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-76280/SFH_Bricks/10281-bonsai-tree-branch-rebuild/"&gt;Rebrickable&lt;/a&gt;, I found instructions on how to slightly modify the branches to look more organic. (The original instructions have the branches fan out in a stiff Y-shape.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instructions for the Bonsai tree and this branch mod are included below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNamaiqKfswlTF1-NyAaKceGuhVI-Kjv/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNamaiqKfswlTF1-NyAaKceGuhVI-Kjv/view"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_instructions.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_instructions.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_instructions.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNqYTkt9yqSid5Dip463n1Wx5CelmSPL/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNqYTkt9yqSid5Dip463n1Wx5CelmSPL/view"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_branch_rebuild_instructions.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_branch_rebuild_instructions.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_branch_rebuild_instructions.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;LED Lighting Kit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mod that people were talking about online was an LED lighting kit. This was made by Lightailing, and they sell various LED kits for many popular Lego models. There are two variations sold for the bonsai tree: one for the green tree, and one for the pink tree. I purchased the appropriate one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(10)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(11)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few other LED kits for the Bonsai kits, but I specifically liked this one because the LED lights were put compatible Lego bricks. Many other kits had LED lights stickers that you put on to the pieces, which I think completely goes against the spirit of Lego. You should always be able to take apart and modify an existing Lego set, and always be able to reuse pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several people online mentioned about how difficult these instructions were to follow, and they were absolutely correct. There are 3 strings of pinks lights meant to be put into the tree, but it's not clear which one is supposed to be used in which branch. In the end, I just ignored the instructions and put them up where they seemed appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This caused a mess of wires at the end. I assume all of those wires should have been the same length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(12)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(13)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, besides the instructions, this kit is really nice. The wires are thin enough that you can place them between bricks to hide them. In the end, the only visible wires and the ones coming out of the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the light are on, this set completely changes. All of the pink light from the LEDs wash over the white branches and turn everything pink. Once all of the gravel is added into the base, the light from the pot is very subtle and looks amazing when all other lights in the room are turned off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(15)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(16)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this model looks amazing, and with the lights it looks even better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(32)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(35)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Building Video&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built this model on Twitch over the weekend with a few people watching. I saved the clip on Twitch, so you can watch the comments. You can view that here: &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1795209749" title="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1795209749"&gt;Twitch.tv/dyreschlock&lt;/a&gt;. But, if for some reason that link goes down, or it's no longer available, I uploaded the full video to Youtube, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1geABWsdN4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Further Modifications&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about how to modify the tree further with some more pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to add more branches, and make a second level to the tree. If I bought a second tree, I could use all of those pieces to make it higher. Also, if I bought a few different pieces, I could make the foliage on the branches a little different on the lower level. If I add a second level to the tree, maybe I could buy a second pair of lights for the high part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Lego is very expensive, so it's hard for me to justify buying all this stuff for something that will just sit on my shelf. Lego is definitely fun to build, but if I'm going to spend the money on a second tree and second lights, that's nearly $90 that could go to something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I dunno. Maybe it's fine to put some money into one set of Legos every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/lego-bonsai-tree</link></item><item><title>Gifu Retro Museum</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Japan is a country rich in history, and a country that is rich in history is also rich in museums. There are many national and prefectural museums that focus on the history of Japan both for culture and art. However, almost all of these museums focus on periods of Japan up through the Meiji era (through 1912) and World War II. Very few focus on the development of Japan after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pick up the slack, there are many independent &lt;b&gt;Retro&lt;/b&gt; museums that can be found in small towns and resort towns. Owners of these museums curate their personal collections of 50-60 year old technology and memorabilia. Most of these gathered from friends or business upgrading their old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(45)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Gifu Retro Museum&lt;/b&gt; is a little different than other retro museum I've been to before. It does curate stuff from the past, but it would be more accurate to call this a Retro Amusement Center. The entry fee is timed, rather than a flat fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adults to Junior High students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hour is 800&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Hours is 2000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Day is 3000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Elementary school students &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hour is 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Hours is 1300&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Day is 2000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Children ages 4 to 6 years old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hour is 300&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Hours is 800&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Day is 800&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "museum" is divided into three distinct separate rooms, each with their own distinctive feel and purpose. I'm sure that the entry pass is required for all three areas. The three rooms are the main room in the middle, which has snacks and arcade machines, the pachinko room on the right, and the food lounge to the left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Main Room&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you enter the middle room, there are old posters and knick knacks pinned to the wall and sitting on old arcade machines and soda machines. When you exit the immediate entrance area, you exit an old style candy shop with lots of sweets and candy for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(7)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few arcade games and several amusement games are fit against the walls where there is space. There is a wack-a-mole game and racing game that probably distributed tickets back in the day. There's a flag game, where the characters tell you to raise or lower flags. There's also a Janken game where you deposit some amount of coin medals. If you win, a roulette will spin and its possible to get 20 times your coins back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Arcade machines, they had an After Burner and Super Hang-on machine. They had a Neo Geo switcher with a few games installed. A cocktail Nintendo VS cabinet, with Super Mario Bros, Mario Bros, and a few others. They had a cabinet with Darkstalkers currently installed. (Curious if they had any other CPS2 games in the back.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the entry paid for time, all arcade games were set to Free Play. So, you could do whatever you like. I played the Flag game for a little bit, trying to quickly understand the Japanese, and I played the Janken game too. The Janken game would be a really fun programming project if I get the chance to learn FPGA programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Pachinko Room&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Main Room leads into the Pachinko room, which is also accessible from the outside. This seems to be the main draw for people to come here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(8)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pachinko room has two rows full of machines from the late 80s and early 90s. They probably rescued this from an old Pachinko parlor that was getting demolished. All machines work and already had a few people on them right as the museum opened in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't exactly sure how the room was supposed to work. In a real pachinko parlor, you buy your balls and go to town on a machine. But, I wasn't sure if you still bought balls even after paying the entry fee, or if you could just grab a tray and mess around? Bleh, I really should've asked, but I was already self-conscious enough with the clerks constantly watching me take photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems like a pretty good activity for the elderly people living in the town. Rather than have them blow tons of money at a real pachinko parlor, they could pay $30 to sit in here all day. They could play the pachinko games they may have played years ago, and try to beat each other's high scores. It would be an amazing place to have a pachinko tournament, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would imagine you could use the balls for free because if you actually had to pay for the balls, then they would have to pay out if you actually won a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Food Area&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third area to the right of the entrance is the food area where they have collected several vintage vending machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(41)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were some vending machine that gave out ice cream and burgers, but many of them sold noodles. I think they were all in working order, but I didn't try any of them out. It was still early in the morning, and I had lunch plans for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of this room was the Mac and Me banner advertising the home video release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(40)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Overall&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think if you plan on playing vintage Pachinko for a few hours, it would be worth the visit. But otherwise, there were too few arcade games to make it worthwhile and there really weren't that many knick knacks to consider it a true retro museum. It's a bit expensive, too, so I wouldn't really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Gifu Retro Museum&lt;/b&gt; is located in Yamagata City, north of Gifu. Here's the location in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7" title="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;. The parking lot is behind the building, which can be difficult to understand when you first arrive.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/gifu-retro-museum</link></item><item><title>Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I finished putting together the Pocket Camera Plus for the Gameboy. This takes all of the original hardware of the GameBoy Camera and puts it into a shell that you can attach actual Camera lens. You can read more about here: &lt;a href="/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus"&gt;/gameboy-camera-plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Sakurano Park &lt;span class='ja'&gt;桜野公園&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms.

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Camera lens gives an incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos. No matter how close or how far away from the subject, the zoom allows you to frame the photo and the focus allows you to get all of the detail. The sensor itself is still primitive by only allowing 4 colors, but you can still get a ton of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, photos are best taken when the subject is clearly light. If there is no strong light source, then it can be hard to squeeze out detail. 4 colors can only do so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Shiroyama Park &lt;span class='ja'&gt;城山公園&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I went to Shiroyama Park downtown and took a few more photos.

All of the eastern and northeastern mountains are visible, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a massive panoramic with the regular camera and many zoomed shots with the Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(73)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1597_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1597_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1597_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1597_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200038.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200038.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200038.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200106.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200106.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200106.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200123.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200123.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200123.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it's incredible how much detail can be squeezed into the GameBoy camera with this lens, and how far it can zoom in. But, there is still one small problem. With the lens zoomed in so far, it's a little difficult to steady the camera. I might invest it a heavier, steadier tripod than the flimsy one I already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a few specific shots of the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="gbcameraColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="columnOne"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(76)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1658.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1658_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1658_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnTwo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200537.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200537.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200537.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="gbcameraColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="columnOne"&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(77)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1659.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1659_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1659_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1659_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnTwo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200609.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200609.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200609.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the native features of the GameBoy Camera software is being able to adjust the Contrast. By pulling that way down, you can get a lot of detail from the mountains, even if they're mostly white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I concluded my photo journey by taking a panorama of Mt. Norikura, which towers over Takayama. The resolution of each Pocket Camera photo is 128x112, so taking a panoramic photo can boost the resolution considerably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200505_stitch.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200505_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/20230409_200505_stitch.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a  onclick="galleryClicked(75)" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1652_stitch.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1652_stitch_t.webp" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1652_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1652_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GameBoy Camera is over 25 years old now, so it's pretty fun being to squeeze as much functionality as possible out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens</link></item></channel></rss>
