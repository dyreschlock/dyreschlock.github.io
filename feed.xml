The single road in town follows the river up into the mountains, going around Mt. Kongodo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金剛堂山&lt;/span&gt;, and coming into Miyagawa, Gifu, on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current neighborhood on Kamimomose seems pretty vibrant enough these days, which several self-help facilities and performance arts camps. Many of the homes look pretty modern and maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until a few years ago, the building of the former branch school was still standing in town. This was the Toga Elementary Kamimomose Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校上百瀬分校&lt;/span&gt;. Like many of the other branch schools in the area, it was probably still in use until 1996, and then closed for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building still stood for 25 years, but no one maintained it, so it began falling apart and became a health hazard because of asbestos. Looking through Google Maps and Google Earth, it was demolished sometime between November 2021 and October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the gymansium still stands, but it has been completely gutted. Even before the main building was demolished, &lt;a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html"&gt;Haiko Rider&lt;/a&gt; reported that a local construction company had been using the gym for storage. Now with the building gone, it has become the perfect open garage to store their larger equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the main building was demolished, it seems like they repaired and reenforced the roof. The old Google Maps show it is red. But, today, it's a reflective black surface. Sometimes it looks blue because of the sky's reflection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 04:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/kamimomose-branch-school</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/kamimomose-branch-school</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Tanoshima Shinmei Shrine 田ノ島神明宮</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Tanoshima Shinmei Shrine is all that remains of Tanoshima Village. The site of the village is along the Toga River going south up the mountain from Sakaue village. It's between the villages of Abetto and Taikanba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A branch school was opened in the village for its children. In 1959, there were 16 students. But the school was closed 6 years later. Perhaps this was because many of the younger families moved away or because a bus service could be established between the village in Sakaue village nearby. The concrete branch schools in the area were built in the 1970s, so this building would've been made out of wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, &lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134"&gt;Hayaneko&lt;/a&gt; visited the village and only 2 houses remained, with one of the houses actually being lived in. Today, all traces of those homes have been removed for some kind of fancy French restaurant and rental cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking in, it reminded me a lot of the restaurant from The Menu. Apparently meals are more than 10000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; a plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side road continues past the restaurant into the forest, and eventually ends with the forest engulfing the road. I wasn't paying attention to the map, so I didn't realize that I went past the shrine quite a while ago. Going back to the restaurant, the shrine is located up on the hill behind the area. You can see it from the road peering through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shinmei Shrines &lt;span class='ja'&gt;神明宮&lt;/span&gt; are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Toga Valley and many rural areas, it's pretty easy to find Shinmei Shrines, as their yearly festivals pray to the gods for an abundant harvest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no one left in the village, I'm not really sure who maintains this shrine. Inside the shrine, a plaque showing the names of all the Shinto priests lies on its side, and hasn't been updated in years. Perhaps the folks running the restaurant keep up the old rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 02:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Senzoku Branch School 千束分校</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Senzoku Branch School is a remote school further up the mountains in the Toga Valley. It was built in 1970 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;昭和&lt;/span&gt;45 to service the 54 students living in Taikanba Village. Originally, it was named Toga Elementary Taikanba Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;利賀小学校大勘場分校&lt;/span&gt;. Later, after some school shuffling, it was renamed to Sakagami Elementary Senzoku Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上小学校千束分校&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1975, there were only 31 students. By 1984 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;昭和&lt;/span&gt;59, the school was no longer regularly used, and in 1996 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平成&lt;/span&gt;8, it was closed completely. According to &lt;a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html"&gt;Heyaneko&lt;/a&gt;, who visited the location in 2011, there was a personalized mailbox, indicating that someone was living there. &lt;a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html"&gt;Haiko Rider&lt;/a&gt; visited the location in 2014 and posts that a construction company was using the location for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the building is no longer there. Google Maps shows the building was still there in November 2021. But, by October 2023, it was demolished. All of these Toga branch schools were built in the same way using a lot of asbestos. With no one maintaining them, they became an incredible health risk, and had to be demolished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/senzoku-branch-school</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/senzoku-branch-school</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Taira Postal Corps Monument 郵送隊之碑</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When I explored Hosoo Pass &lt;span class='ja'&gt;細尾峠&lt;/span&gt; in early June this year, I learned about how the mountain pass was a pivotal connection point of the mountain villages of southwest Toyama to the urban areas of the north. One important part of this history was the postal service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 1970, especially in the winter, because of the large amounts of winter mountain snow, mail was still carried by hand. Carriers of Johana Town would bring the mail to the Hosoo Postal Exchange where they would meet carriers from Taira Village. Both teams left at 9am and met around 1pm. They would exchange their packages and letters. Then, they'd go back down the mountain to their post offices. These folks were known as the Postal Corps &lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵送隊&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins"&gt;Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;細尾峠郵便交換所&lt;/span&gt; was one of the places I visited when I explored Hosoo Pass. I went there on June 3rd. It turns out that just a days prior on May 31st, they held a dedication ceremony for the creation of a monument devoted to the Taira Postal Corps in Taira Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monument details the history of the Postal Corps and includes 3 photos taken in the 1960s. There are a few individual credits on the back of the monument. The &lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵送隊之碑&lt;/span&gt; calligraphy was done by Fumio Yamamoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山本文雄&lt;/span&gt;. And the 3 photos were taken by Toshio Takada &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高田&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;俊夫&lt;/span&gt;, Shinobu Soga &lt;span class='ja'&gt;曽我忍&lt;/span&gt;, and Tsutomu Takada &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高田勉&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The May 31st ceremoney was held by the mayor, the chairs of the commeration committee, and Shinobu Soga, one of the men who took a photo of the Postal Corps. The Yomiuri Newspaper wrote &lt;a href="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/" title="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/"&gt;an article about it&lt;/a&gt;. In the article, it mentions how Soga was a location scout for a film studio in Kyoto and came to Gokayama looking for locations. He learned of the Postal Corps and wanted to travel with them and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, he could get some amazing unique photos of the team. Of the three photos on the monument, I think this one was his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the other photos shows the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office in the 60s in winter. Having been there a few weeks prior, they apparently made an addition to the building sometime in the 60s. The plaque in the Postal Exchange Office mentioned that mail increased significantly in the 60s because of economic reform. The Postal Corps chain would somtimes include up to 30 members. So, I suppose they needed the extra space for the package exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information"&gt;transcription and translation&lt;/a&gt; of the plaque at the Postal Exchange office in the woods in the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaque on the monument gives a brief history of the Postal Corps. Here's a transcription and translation of the contents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;かって、冬期間積雪により交通機関が断され&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;陸の孤島と化していた越中五箇山の人々に&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;文化の火をもたらす役割を果たたのが&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵便遞送隊&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class='ja'&gt;通称&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵送隊&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class='ja'&gt;でした。&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;当時、平・城端両郵便局では請負人を雇用隊を編成して標高七四〇&lt;/span&gt;m&lt;span class='ja'&gt;の細尾峠近くに設けられた郵便交換所まで背負って運び渡していました。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Postal Transport Corps (commonly known as the Postal Corps) played a role in bringing a firey culture to the people of Etchu Gokayama, who were once isolated village islands in the winter when transportation was cut off due to snowfall. At that time, the Taira and Johana Post Offices organized contractors into teams to carry mail on their backs to the postal exchange office located near Hosoo Pass, 740 meters above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;明治十五年下梨郵便局&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class='ja'&gt;現平局&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class='ja'&gt;開設されて以来、城端局と片道約二〇&lt;/span&gt;km&lt;span class='ja'&gt;の峠山道を徒歩で往復していました。昭和十年長い間続いた直送を廃し、両局の中程に位置する細尾峠で郵袋を交換する方法なりました。その後、バスの開通に伴い通常期はバス託送に改め、昭和三十年から請負による交換便は冬期に限られることになりました。深雪・吹雪の中隊員苦労は想像を絶するものでした。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Shimonashi Post Office (now Taira Post Office) was opened in 1882, mail was sent back and forth between Johana Post Office on foot along the mountain pass, about 20km one-way**. In 1935, the long-running direct delivery system was discontinued, as the method of mail exchange was changed to bus delivery at Hosoo Pass, located between the two offices. After that, the normal period was changed to bus delivery, and from 1955, the contracted exchange service was limited to winter. The hardships faced by the members of the Postal Corps in the deep snow and blizzards were unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(**note: The monument says one-way, but it's only 10 km one-way. It's 20 km round trip.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;時代と共に、請負人の雇用難・雪崩危険等に鑑み、昭和四十五年八十八年間に渡る郵送隊のの歴史を閉じました。その後冬期は庄川の船便等を利用する輸送となり昭和五十九年&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class='ja'&gt;国道三〇四号線に五箇山トンネルが開通したことにより、専用自動車便が通年運行され、現在に至っています。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As times changed, the Postal Corps came to an end after 88 years of operation in 1970, due to the difficulty of finding contractors and the risk of avalanches. After that, transportation in the winter was changed to ship services on the Shogawa River. In 1984, the Gokayama Tunnel was opened on National Route 304, and dedicated automobile services began to operate year-round, which continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵送隊の大きな功績は&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Achievements of the Postal Corps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;・厳冬の雪深い峠道を人力で郵便物&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class='ja'&gt;生活必需品&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class='ja'&gt;を運び地域住民の暮らしを支えた。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- They carried mail (a daily necessity) by hand through snowy mountain passes in the harsh winter, supporting the lives of local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;・隊員の大半は主婦で女性の忍耐と献身性が特筆される。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Most of the members were housewives, and the perserverance and dedication of women is particulary noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;・郵便局では&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;地域への奉仕・貢献の原点として語り継がれている。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- At the post office, it is passed down as the origin of service and contribution to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;ここにその功績を称え&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;史実を後世に伝えるものです。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, we commemorate their achievements and pass on the historical facts to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;令和七年五月&lt;/span&gt; - May 2025&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵送隊を称える会&lt;/span&gt; - The Postal Corps Commemoration Committee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monument is a great way of commemorating such a unique service in the area. But, the monument is a little sad. They placed the monument at the location of the original Shimonashi Post Office from 50 years ago, but that building has moved since then. Now, there's only houses and an open field next to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current Taira Post Office is just down the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it's a pretty amazing coincidence that I started exploring and researching about this stuff at the same time this monument was created. Many of these remote rural areas of Japan have their own unique stories, and many of those stories have been immortalized on monuments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 03:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/postal-corps-monument</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/postal-corps-monument</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Abandoned Nashitani Village 梨谷村</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Located in a small valley between the two major mountain passes of travel connecting the urban areas of Tonami &lt;span class='ja'&gt;砺波町&lt;/span&gt; and Johana Town &lt;span class='ja'&gt;城端町&lt;/span&gt; to the large village of Shimonashi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下梨村&lt;/span&gt; (modern day Taira &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平村&lt;/span&gt;), was the village of Nashitani &lt;span class='ja'&gt;梨谷村&lt;/span&gt;. Today, what remains of the village is slightly hidden behind the Taira Ski Resort and Restaurant Maple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several houses in the village still standing, and some of the homes seem like they've had some recently maintenance work done of them. According to some online research done by &lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html"&gt;Mr. Murakage&lt;/a&gt;, there were people living in some homes until 1982. Although, even though it doesn't seem like anyone is living here today, the families still come back to check on the houses. He and &lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123"&gt;Hayaneko&lt;/a&gt; visited in 2011 and found no one there, and neither did I during my visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When parking at the Taira Ski Resort, you can see the village poking through the area behind Restaurant Maple. The restaurant seems like its open every day to cater to the construction workers up in the mountains doing whatever work they do. I arrived before the opening time, and the people working at the restaurant were preparing for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road to the village loops behind the restaurant and goes up the hill. You walk past a grave and some monuments. The monuments were too withered away to fully understand them. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.jpg"&gt;The grave&lt;/a&gt; was marked as Hotouge Family &lt;span class='ja'&gt;朴峠家&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html"&gt;Murakage-san&lt;/a&gt; was able to research the names of the 28 homes that used to be in the village, and he listed them on his page. The Hotouge Family apparently moved to Osaka in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still standing in the main area of the village were three homes, and a few sheds and garages. The first home was owned by the Yamazaki Family &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山崎家&lt;/span&gt;. The next home was owned by the Higashi Family &lt;span class='ja'&gt;東家&lt;/span&gt;. The Higashi Family had &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.jpg"&gt;a grave&lt;/a&gt; behind their house, but there was no Yamazaki grave. There was a foundation for a small building behind there, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the homes in the area their windows boarded up, and occassionally some extra supports along the outsides. This was mainly to prevent any structural or internal damage happening from excessive snow and snow melt in the winter. As such, the only access to the homes were the front doors, which were all locked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one more home in this small neighborhood cluster. Rather than wooden supports and protection, it was covered in aluminum siding, which was probably installed in the last 20 years. The whole home seemed like it was perfectly preserved inside its metal shell. Out back, there was a family grave, but I don't remember the name. If I were to guess, it was probably Tsujimoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;辻本&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of this neighborhood cluster was the village's temple. The door was open, so I went inside to take a look. It seemed like it was pretty well taken care of for a building that was probably over 100 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temple included a shrine behind the folding walls, but covering the inside walls of the temple were names and names and names of everyone who was a member of the shrine. Every little bit of upper wall space was covered in thin wooden planks, each denoting a single person's membership. The planks didn't have any dates, but according to Murakage's page, the history of the village went back further than the  Meiji period. Many of the names matched Murakage's listing of famliies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through my photos, this white plaque was the most recent dated Heisei 10 or 1997 &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平成十年吉日&lt;/span&gt;. The title says &lt;span class='ja'&gt;梨谷村道場修繕工事一式&lt;/span&gt;, which seems to translate as Nashitani Village Dojo Repair Work Company All Members. And then it lists 66 members, and an additional 3 executive members &lt;span class='ja'&gt;実行委員&lt;/span&gt;. The 3 executive members are Nakai &lt;span class='ja'&gt;中井&lt;/span&gt;, Yamazaki &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山崎&lt;/span&gt;, and Arai &lt;span class='ja'&gt;荒井&lt;/span&gt;. In fact, there are many planks throughout the temple (or dojo?) of the Yamazaki family. Maybe their family were the mayors of the village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, so far, we've seen the Yamazaki Home, Higashi Home, village Temple or Dojo, and Tsujimoto Home. Behind the Tsujimoto home were storage building that were half torn apart and perhaps a few more winters away from complete collapse. The road continued past this cluster, which revealed the Nakai Home &lt;span class='ja'&gt;中井家&lt;/span&gt;  on the bend of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a walkway going past the Nakai Home into some farm fields and a storage shed was some equipment that was probably still used 10 years ago. Next to the storage shed was the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.jpg"&gt;family grave&lt;/a&gt; for the Uji Family &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宇治家&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small area felt very classic country, like the Shire in Lord of the Rings. A wavy stone path with a stone wall connecting homes to homes with circular plots of fields for whatever they grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to the Nakai Home, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0846.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0846.jpg"&gt;their family grave&lt;/a&gt; was out front, too. It's important to note that all of these graves were very clean, recognizable, and had recent flowers placed on them. It would seem like these families, whether the original residents are still alive living elsewhere or their descendants, still return here after winter to maintain the houses and the graves. Actually, a whole field of grass near the Nakai home showed signs of it being mowed in the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nashitani Village is abandoned in that no one lives here, but it's not so abandoned that people haven't forgotten about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the final home in the area, the Kuribayashi Home &lt;span class='ja'&gt;栗林&lt;/span&gt;, had quite a lot of recent repair work done on the front, including a new door with its &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.jpg"&gt;wrapping&lt;/a&gt; still on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakage's page again lists all the families living in the village since the Meiji period, and only 5 families were still living in Nashitani by 1982 (Showa 57). Those 5 families were Yamazaki, Higashi, Tsujimoto, Arai, and Nakai. The Arai family married into the Yamazaki family. There was also the maintained grave for the Uji family. They apparently only moved to Johana, a mere 10km away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kuribayashi family, though... Murakage lists them as having moved to either Kyoto or Hokkaido in the 60s. I wonder whose been fixing up their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those 5 main homes and the temple, plus a garage and a few other storage buildings were all that I could find in the area. Apparently, there's another home further up the Nashitani river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakage-san visited Nashitani with another abandoned village researched named &lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123"&gt;Hayaneko&lt;/a&gt;. He does a lot of research of these village by looking up old schools, specifically branch schools. Branch schools are extensions of the main school in the area that cater specifically to the residents of remote villages. It's often too often and too dangerous to have the kids travel to school each day, so a local school was built and a teacher lives at the school during the week or sometimes for the whole winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out here, the school was named Taira Village Shimonashi Elementary School - Nashitani Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平村立下梨小学校梨谷分校&lt;/span&gt;. According to his research, the school was classified as a Grade 3 Remote School and had 24 students in 1959 (Showa 34). It was apparently built in 1902 (Meiji 35). According ot Wikipedia, the branch school was officially closed in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any elementary students left in the area went to Shimonashi Elementary School after the branch school closed, which became much easier in 1973 with the completion of the Nashitani Tunnel in 1973. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in 1999, the two elementary schools in the area, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary both closed when Taira Elementary School was established. Not much later, in 2004 during the phase of rural municipal mergers across Japan, the whole southwestern area of Toyama became Nanto City. In 2006, elementary school students now went to Kamitaira Elementary School,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like the graves and the temple are the most interesting part of this village. According to Google Maps, the name of the temple of the Nashitani Nembutsu Dojo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;梨谷念仏道場&lt;/span&gt;. Apparently, Nembutsu is a specific sect of Buddhist spread a priest named Rennyo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;蓮如上人&lt;/span&gt; who lived in the Gokayama mountains. He began preaching about Joho Shinshu during the Muromachi period and gained many followers in the mountain and in Nanto Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Edo Period, he was able to build temples in many of the small mountain villages for the locals to practice the religion. The temple were apparently unique in that they were as large as a normal homes, and priests could live in them. Looking back through some names, the priest of Nashitani may have been named Anchi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;安地&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each one of the graves is nearly identical with the exception of the famliy's name. The top reads &lt;span class='ja'&gt;南無阿弥陀佛&lt;/span&gt; or Namuamida Hotoke. Namuamida is Buddha. Hotoke, I think, means statue or monument. Maybe it doesn't mean grave after all...  But, I think these monuments were still erected to pay respects to the families of the past 200 years. Weird that I never saw the Yamazaki one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does feel like the many pockets of society dotted throughout the Gokayama mountains have been slowly reclaimed by nature, I'm actually surprised how much information I could find out about this one. If I did more research, I wonder if I could find out more about the people who lived here, and what their modern-age descendants might be doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/abandoned-nashitani-village</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/abandoned-nashitani-village</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Abandoned Ueda Village 上田村</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Old Ueda Village used to be a key destination on the old Gokayama Highway, leaving the urban area of Tonami City &lt;span class='ja'&gt;砺波町&lt;/span&gt; and Johana Town &lt;span class='ja'&gt;城端町&lt;/span&gt; and going up into the southwestern mountains of Toyama prefecture. After Ueda Village, there was nothing but the road, the trees, and the climb. Many of the residents made their living catering to these travelers, or by working as porters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the first mountain was &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins"&gt;Hosoo Pass &lt;span class='ja'&gt;細尾峠&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I wrote about before. The Hosoo Pass and the area is well known for its Postal Corps, a group of housewives and local people employed by the postal service who would cross the mountain every day during winter to deliver the mail. When descending from the pass from the other side, you'd reach &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="https://theschlock.com/abandoned-nashitani-village"&gt;Nashitani Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;梨谷村&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then after going over Ose Pass, you'd reach Taira Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平村&lt;/span&gt; and Shinonashi Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下梨村&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the war, Japan began to rebuild and became an economic icon. They invested a lot of money into infrastructure, making many of the remote areas more accessible. The Gokayama Highway became Route 304, and as transportation also became stronger, fewer and fewer people were stopping at Ueda before going up the mountain. In 1970, a new Route 304 was established, and now no one traveled through Ueda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1973, the remaining residents of the Ueda Village all moved away together to the Rikyu area of Johana Town, leaving what was left of their homes to be reclaimed by the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a monument was erected in remembrance of the old village. I put a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/ueda-village-translation" title="https://theschlock.com/ueda-village-translation"&gt;transcription and translation&lt;/a&gt; of that monument in another post, so you can view the information directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monument details the history of the village with its credits listed on the back of the monument. On the larger stone monument, a town map has been enshrined. It lists 35 households from 1945 (Showa 20). From research done &lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html"&gt;Kage-kan&lt;/a&gt;, Ueda village had 30 homes with 174 people in 1872. The number of homes may have peaked in 1930 with 42 homes. As mentioned above, it was 35 homes in 1945. Kage-kan says 22 homes in 1946. And only 8 homes in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently when Kage-kan and Hayaneko visited the area in 2011, there were still some wooden remains of a few houses. Today, I couldn't any trace of homes other than some stone foundations and a few bridges that crossed the steam and went no where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the town map again, there are a lot of side roads branching off of old Route 304. The map shows a shrine off in a direction, so I wondered if there were still any traces of that left. Usually people still attend to shrines long after the area is desserted. (Of course, I wasn't able to sight-read the monument, so I didn't know the shrine had folded and its diety moved into town.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the street from the monument, it did look like there was a path leading into the forest. It was heavily overgrown, but my legs were completely wrapped up and I had my work gloves. I could power through it if the path continued to be noticeable enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tearing through vines and overgrowth wasn't that bad, and the path continued to lead to a raised clearing which must've been a foundation for a home. So, I figured that I must have been going the right way. Although, looking at the map, it was clearly not. The path to the shrine went up a bit, so I continued up, but the ground was too muddy and unstable. I stepped on the ground, and my foot sunk into a mud hole. Meh, I'm going back. It's probably better to try and run through the woods in fall after the growth has died down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got back in my car and continued driving south going up the mountain. Along the road were several dumping pits for concrete rubble. Further up the road was a construction site for machinery milling out parts of the mountain to create concrete and concrete blocks used for road construction and such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road twisted back on itself and sharply shot up the mountain to reach the current Route 304.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the junction, you could look back down and see just how thick the forests were after so much rain and sun in May and June. Way up in the left corner of that photo, you can see &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins"&gt;Hosoo Pass &lt;span class='ja'&gt;細尾峠&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ultimate destination of all the porters who lived in Ueda Village when they transported things to Gokayama. By continuing up the new Route 304 (new as of 1970), you'll reach the destination of the porters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, finding the Ueda (Futatsuya) Village monument took a little bit of research. I had found those webpages of &lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122"&gt;Hayaneko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html"&gt;Kage-kan&lt;/a&gt; going to the village in 2011, but it's not marked on the map, and both reports don't actually say where it is. I had a general idea where it was, though, given the location of Hosoo Pass. And just north of Hosoo Pass was Futatsuya River following north into Johana. It had to be along there, but I didn't really have confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I was really looking for was the first image in &lt;a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122"&gt;Hayaneko's Post&lt;/a&gt;. There was an old road sign pointing to Ueda two kilometers ahead. This had to be somewhere in southern Johana. I poked around a lot Google Map Street View, and I finally found it. This is at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z" title="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z"&gt;36°29'03.5"N 136°53'32.4"E&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Street View had an entry for 2021 and 2012, both of which had the sign removed from its posts. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.jpg"/&gt;When I arrived at the location&lt;/a&gt;, the posts were no longer in the ground. There was some debris nearby, some piles of loose lumber, possibly from a demolished shed. I found &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0369.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0369.jpg"&gt;an old bus stop sign&lt;/a&gt; partially buried in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way back to my car, I looked over at the shed with metal siding and saw the sign, continuing to rust and decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gifu was still visible, but both towns of Ueda &lt;span class='ja'&gt;上田&lt;/span&gt; and Shimonashi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下梨&lt;/span&gt; had decayed. Interesting that those two of the three had been abandoned and decayed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going through Ueda village and back up the mountain, my next location was another abandoned village, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="https://theschlock.com/abandoned-nashitani-village"&gt;Nashitani Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;梨谷村&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Shimonashi was the main village along river, and Nashitani was futher up the mountain between Ose Pass and Hosoo Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/abandoned-ueda-village</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/abandoned-ueda-village</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Iiyama Temple 飯山寺</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Iiyama Temple is a small yet somewhat fabled temple on the outskirts of the downtown area of Takayama. It's now all that remains of the Iiyama family and castle, which was said to be a psuedonymn of Asahina Saburou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;朝比奈三郎&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to the area because I was looking around at locations of castle ruins in Takayama. I had never noticed this before, nor really knew anything about it. Also, Google Maps didn't even have a road going to it, so it seems like an interesting place to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach the temple, there's an unremarkable unpaved side road that goes up a hill through some farms. The farmland is still being used, so some rice planting equipment was on the side of the road. The narrow roads winds up the hill as most side roads do, and the forest opens up to reveal the temple and a rather large garden with some old folks doing their various gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being the height of June, all the plants and grass have grown to take over much of the area. There were several historical plaques posted near the temple with each more recent plaque having more detailed information of the history and significance of the temple. I made a separate post with full &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/iiyama-temple-translations" title="https://theschlock.com/iiyama-temple-translations"&gt;transcriptions and translations&lt;/a&gt; of those plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legend of the temple begins with Asahina Saburou, a legend of Japanese folklore. After his defeat in the Heiji Rebellion, he apparently fled to Hida and lived in hiding by changing his name to Iiyama. At this location, at the foot of the mountain, he built his castle and estate. Although, the plaque says that the rebellion was in 1159, but Wikipedia says Asahina was born in 1176, so who knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After building his estate, he ultimately came into possession of a statue of the eleven-headed Kannon. He built a hall within his estate to house and display the statue. This hall was named Reishoin &lt;span class='ja'&gt;霊松院&lt;/span&gt;. The hall was later refashioned into a temple in 1339 for the statue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Miki Yoritsuna (1540-1587) invaded Hida and burned down Iiyama's castle and estate, along with the temple. Miki built &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="https://theschlock.com/matsukura-castle-harayama"&gt;Matsukura Castle&lt;/a&gt; on the top of that mountain to defend the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Kanamori Clan swept through Hida and conquered it, Kanamori &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近&lt;/span&gt; ordered a Shingon monk to rebuild the temple at its current location, which was said to be where Iiyama Castle and estate once stood. The temple was renamed Toukouzan Iiyama Temple &lt;span class='ja'&gt;東向山飯山寺&lt;/span&gt;. This was in 1604.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Edo Period, with Tokugawa Shogunate in full control of Japan, a priest named Genkai &lt;span class='ja'&gt;玄海&lt;/span&gt; began the revival of state sanctioned Buddhism. He moved to Takayama and lived in Iiyama Temple as he helped rebuild and shape Kokubunji Temple downtown. He also rebuilt Ichinomiya Shrine to the south. The Buddhism revival attracted many lords and people, so the temple flourished again. The current worship hall at Iiyama Temple was part of Ichinomiya Temple reconstruction, and later moved here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the temple, the wooden statue of the eleven-headed Kannon is still there, according to the plaque. All of the doors were closed, and the entrances were covered in screens for protection against animals. For a time, the temple was home to two works by the Japanese Monk, Enku &lt;span class='ja'&gt;円空&lt;/span&gt;, both of which are designated as cultural properties of Gifu prefecture. Those works are now on display in the Takayama City Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the Temple having been largely abandoned, every seven years the temple opens again for the public to view the priceless statues inside. Although, apparently, this practice may have stopped in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the exit to the forest was a small collection of Ojizosama. It seemed like it had been several years since they've been tended to. One of the Jizos didn't even have a face anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ojizosama statues offer two kinds of protection. One of these protections are for children who have died too early in life. As a child's soul passes into the afterlife, it doesn't have its parents to guide them. So, the Jizo-sama protect them like a parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, I think the more common protection of these statues is for travelers, which is why you see these statues everywhere when driving around in the mountains. The Jizo-sama protect people traveling long distances and help them reach their destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the hill, there are a few more statues and monuments, but many of them had been knocked over by snow melt. Now, they've become buried again from the high grass. Up on the hill behind the temple and behind the monuments was a cellphone tower. The cellphone tower seems like it gets more attention these days than the temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon entering and leaving the area, you pass by a small shrine on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stone sign next to it says it's the Iiyama Temple Children's Area &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飯山寺子供地域&lt;/span&gt;. Back in the day, this might make sense as an area for the Temple's children to use while the adults perform the festival at the main temple. Nowadays, the road to the temple goes directly passed it, so it's only still here for preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the road leading to the temple is a fairly unremarkable side road off of Route 41. The side road used to be masked by a construction company and their large building, but I feel like they had been slowly going out of business over the last several years. Now, this main building has been completely demolished. Looking through Google, it must've happen in the last 6 months, which is really recent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's remarkable to go around Japan and find pockets of rich history. But, it's also almost just as remarkable how fast they can tear down their modern buildings when their business moves or changes. Living in Takayama for over 12 years, there have been so many changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/iiyama-temple</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/iiyama-temple</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Hosoo Pass 細尾峠 &amp; Postal Station Ruins 郵便交換所</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Hosoo Pass was a crucial route for the people living in the valley villages of southwestern Toyama and Johana Town, the closest major city. People living in these villages were largely cut off from the main Japanese society. One of the main transportation routes was along the Sho River &lt;span class='ja'&gt;庄川&lt;/span&gt;, but the river only went through mountains in the north. A whole range of mountains encircled the southern end of Johana shielding the town from the valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the old Hosoo Pass route was established in 1887 (Meiji 20). It was fairly direct ascent up the mountains, but the road twisted enough that it was smooth travel for people and easy for horses, too. This 10 kilometer route was far more convenient than the 40 kilometer detour north following the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the road, at the top of Hosoo Pass, you can clearly see Johana Town and the rest of the Takaoka and Tonami area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days that old route is no longer used. In 1927 (Showa 2), the Yahata Road &lt;span class='ja'&gt;八幡道路&lt;/span&gt; was completed. It was a paved road that went directly from Johana Town, through Hosoo Pass, and continued to the Taira and Kamitaira villages before ending in Shimonashi village on Sho River. Part of this new road was the Hosoo Pass tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the southern end of Hosoo Pass, continuing to Taira and Shimonashi villages, the old route went over Kakuma Pass &lt;span class='ja'&gt;鹿熊峠&lt;/span&gt;, but in 1973, the Nashitani Tunnel &lt;span class='ja'&gt;梨谷トンネル&lt;/span&gt; was completed which decommisioned that part of the route. In 1979, construction on the Gokayama Tunnel &lt;span class='ja'&gt;五箇山トンネル&lt;/span&gt; began and finished in 1981. The tunnel went directly through the mountains and connected with the Nashitani Tunnel. Yahata Road going through Hosoo Pass was no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road is still usable today despite the occassional fallen rocks and branches from the cliffs above. Old folks still drive along the road and clear the debris. Enough preventions have been set to prevent landslides, but eventually there could be a large enough landslide to knock out the road, rendering Hosoo Pass no longer travelable from the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adventure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I traveled to Hosoo Pass. At the time, I knew nothing about the area, so I followed Google Map's suggestions, which lead me to several closed roads, taking too much time, and forcing me to return a few days later. That's the day that I went to that &lt;a href="donohara-winter-branch-school" title="donohara-winter-branch-school"&gt;Donohara Winter Branch School&lt;/a&gt;. That branch school was along the Sho River to the north of Shimonashi village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my second trip, I left my house early at 6:30am and arrived at Hosoo Pass around 8am, an hour by highway and 30 minutes on mountain roads. Before exploring the rest of Hosoo Pass and Yahata Road, I took the side path next to Hosoo Tunnel to climb Hakamagoshiyama. I detailed that hike in a &lt;a href="hakamagoshiyama" title="hakamagoshiyama"&gt;different post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hosoo Pass Tea House Ruins &lt;span class='ja'&gt;細尾峠の茶屋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today it's no longer a spectacle, but next to Hosoo Tunnel was a two story Tea House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all that remains are 7 metal posts sticking out of the ground and a bunch of metal garbage behind them. Much of that metal garbage is the old aluminum roof of the building. There was also a refrigerator back there, and a few other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea when the tea house was built, but it apparently had no running water, nor any electricity of its own. For those people who traveled along the old route in the Meiji and early Showa periods, this had to have been used as a rest stop in the middle of the journey from Johana to Taira or Shimonashi. Later, after it closed, construction companies used it as an office and warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking around the Internet, I found a webpage that had a photo of the tea house in the year 2001. I copied the page and &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/pages/hosoo.html" title="https://theschlock.com/pages/hosoo.html"&gt;hosted it here&lt;/a&gt; as a backup. You could clearly see the 7 white metal posts holding up the front of the building, but many of the windows have been broken out, and the building doesn't look very safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found some other photos other sites, too. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.jpg"&gt;Here's a photo&lt;/a&gt; of less than half of the building remaining from around 2005, I think. And then another &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/hosoo/20190906133106.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/image/hosoo/20190906133106.jpg"&gt;photo from 2019&lt;/a&gt; of a more distinct pile of rubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there is so little left. I think, year after year, snow melt continued to push and move the garbage away from the site and down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hosoo Postal Exchange Ruins &lt;span class='ja'&gt;細尾峠郵便交換所&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hundred meters away from the tunnel and tea house is the ruins of the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange office. Finding this building is not very easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yahata Road curves along the rim of the mountain and has a steep drop off. There's a 3-meter drop to the ground from the road, and the ground is angled at 45 degrees. But apparently there's a trail down there which was the old Hosoo Pass route. Google Maps doesn't mark any kind of entry, but the OSM maps had a trail. And at those coordinates, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.jpg"&gt;I found a rope&lt;/a&gt;. The rope trails trials off into the brush going nearly straight down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first trip, I did not believe that was the entry point, but I confirmed it later at home. When I came back on the weekend, I put on my worker gloves and scaled down to ground. The trail apparently hugs the road and then shoots off along the ridge of the mountain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there's no clear indication of a trail and you're cutting through brush, it's hard to tell if you're going the right way. I naturally followed the downward slope of the mountain, but then remembered this was not the way. I climbed up a bit, using the plants as handles and found a flattened spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I headed in the direction that seemed correct, I noticed a red flag on a tree. Okay, I am actually going the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the trail was completely covered in brush, but there were the occassional stone and cement bricks along the path. The trail did hug the road for a little bit before heading off in the direction of the mountain ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after 10 or 15 minutes, the ruins poked through the brush in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the ruins was a large painted board that detailed the history of Hosoo Pass and the Post Office. I transcribed the board and put a translation &lt;a href="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information"&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Taira Post Office was established in Shimonashi in 1872 (Meiji 5), the Postal Corps &lt;span class='ja'&gt;郵送隊&lt;/span&gt; was also established. The Postal Corps was a group of people who lived in the villages of Taira and Shimonashi. This group of people would gather all the mail for the day and physically hike up to Hosoo Pass and down to Johana. They would collect the mail at Johana, and then return to Taira Post Office. Each person carried a maximum of 18 kilograms of mail and packages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did this 20 kilometer round trip every day, even in winter. When the traveled the formed a line of people. Sometimes in winter, blizzards would be so strong that it was difficult for the mail carriers to see the next person in front of them. They constantly had to sound off to make sure no one was left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later in 1887, the old Hosoo Pass route opened which made this travel must easier and faster. Again, in 1927 the paved road, Yahata Road, was opened which made travel more convenient in summer, and now mail could be transported by trucks. But the Postal Corps still transported the mail by foot in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1945, ths Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office was built. Now, the Postal Corps had two teams. Both teams who would leave Taira and Johana post offices at 9am and meet here. Parcels and Mail would be exchanged between both teams. And then, they'd return to their towns. This cut travel time in half, but required more workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1955, as Japan experienced significant economic growth, many temporary workers were hired to match the workload. However, by 1971, the villages of Taira, Ueda, and all the areas around Shimonashi experienced significant depopulation. The current members of the corps were aging, and young people moved away to live in larger cities. The postal corps was abolished that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And again, the Nashitani and Gokayama tunnels were completed in 1973 and 1981, which made the road obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brickwork and cement structure is still holding after 80 years, but all of the metalwork has rusted, and the roof of the office building has collapsed. Part of the roof still protects the signboard from the weather, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a few more pictures and then returned to the road. Out of the entrance to the Postal Exchange, the old route branches up and down the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention, but I managed to go the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving along the ridge of the mountain, I came to the area underneath the paved road. The old route snaked along with the road until it came to that 3-meter drop off with the rope. But, I figured that I could just ascend anywhere that seemed easy enough to reach the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this looked like a good spot. I grabbed the trees and climbed up. With each step, I grabbed the next bit of plants coming out of the ground. Often I would lose my footing and slip down, but I was able to keep advancing and pulling myself up. Inch by inch, I finally saw the outline of the road and had my exit in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved along the 3-meter drop off until some plants were high enough to vault me up to a guardrail pipe and then I yanked myself up onto the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have shimmied along the road back to the rope, but I was back to civilization, and back on easy street. I returned to my car and continued down towards Johana to meet the Gokayama Tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road continued to snake along the edge of the mountain. Occassionally I would have to squeak my car to the side to let another car pass. Lots of people were using the road today. I'm not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gokayama Tunnel Emergency Exit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually around a corner of the mountain road, this structure came into view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I had no idea what this was. A small stream was flowing over part of it, so I thought it was a hydroelectric plant, using the natural spring of the mountain for power. There was an occassional whirring sound, too, which I thought it was a turbine or some kind of internal machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The northern side of the structure had plastic windows, several of which were broken. I took a look inside, and a car whizzed by! Ah... I checked the map. This was part of the Gokayama tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the large square garage-looking door, one of the emergency exits was not locked, and I could go inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was about a kilometer into the 3km tunnel. The road wasn't super busy, but cars whizzed by every minute or so. Next to the emergency exit was an SOS phone. Wikipedia mentions that the Gokayama tunnel was built in two parts, so maybe this was the half point of its construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took some photos, and then returned to my car. I continued to the end of Yahata Road, next to the mouth of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some weird art structure nearby, but this was the end of Yahata Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sakaide &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂出&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 6 hours of hiking and driving around the old road, I went to Shimonashi for lunch. Sakaide was a small family owned restaurant in the center of Shimonashi village. They had the standard dishes of Udon, Soba, and Rice Bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the menu, I noticed that they served bear meat in their dishes, so I ordered the Bear Meat Soba, or &lt;span class='ja'&gt;くま肉そば&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soba was great, although soba is always great. I don't know how it stood apart from other soba I've had before. In the soba were chunks of cooked bear meat. It also wasn't really remarkable. They tasted like cuts of beef. It was good, but I think buying the mountain vegetable soba &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山菜そば&lt;/span&gt; would've probably been better. Either way, it was exactly the meal I wanted for lunch. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When driving down the highways and motorways of Japan, there are so many side roads that go off along mountains or continue into forests. I have driven past hundreds of these roads and barely given a thought to where they lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like this case, they are often the original old roads that snaked around the mountain before tunnels were built. Also, these roads traveled to villages that once were and are no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timeline of the Adventure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6:30ish&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Left Home&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:00am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Arrived at Hosoo Pass Tunnel&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591"&gt;36°26'51.0"N 136°53'48.4"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:25am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hakamagoshiyama" title="https://theschlock.com/hakamagoshiyama"&gt;Hiking Hakamagoshiyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013"&gt;36°25'54.3"N 136°52'47.7"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:00am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Car&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427"&gt;36°25'56.6"N 136°52'49.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:15am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tea House Ruins&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035"&gt;36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:30am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(Jumping down the cliff)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997"&gt;36°26'56.2"N 136°54'01.4"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:45am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Finding the Post Office&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417"&gt;36°27'03.9"N 136°54'00.2"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:05am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leaving the Post Office&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:15am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Climbing to the Road&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224"&gt;36°26'59.7"N 136°54'03.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:25am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Car&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035"&gt;36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:50am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Highway Emergency Exit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906"&gt;36°27'37.7"N 136°54'39.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12:15pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to the Main Highway&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231"&gt;36°27'54.0"N 136°54'11.7"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12:30pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sakaide &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂出&lt;/span&gt; (for lunch)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503"&gt;36°25'59.3"N 136°56'54.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Hakamagoshiyama 袴腰山</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hakamagoshiyama is a mountain in southwestern Toyama. It's a pretty short climb, and more seasoned hikers use it as the first stop of a much longer hike going to the peaks bordering Toyama and Ishikawa prefectures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I planned to explore &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins"&gt;Hosoo Pass&lt;/a&gt; and the various ruins along that road. The trailhead for Hakamagoshiyama was in the opposite direction after reaching the Hosoo Pass Tunnel. The entirity of the road for Hosoo Pass was paved, but after turning off for the mountain, it was all rock and dirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped a few times to clear some rocks from the road. I also had to move to the side to let a car go through. I guess some other folks just drive over the rocks in the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trailhead for the hike was clearly marked, but I parked about 100 meters away from the entrance because of a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7792.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7792.jpg"&gt;crack in the road&lt;/a&gt;. It was probably safe to drive over, but a few other cars were parked away from the fissure, so I parked back there, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiking to the peak of Hakamagoshiyama was pretty rough. Immediately from the start, the path went nearly straight up. This first part of the hike wasn't too bad, as steps were carved and placed into the ground. The trees gave way to a clear sky above and when reaching the top of the stairs, a rest hut was at the top of the first peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was pretty early in the hike for a rest, but the hut was meant more for hikers in the winter starting from the villages at the base of the mountains. There is too much snow in the winter to be plowed, so anyone hiking these mountains would spend more than a day doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving further to the edge of this peak, you could see most of the distance someone would have to travel from below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was about 300 or 400 meters into the hike so far. There was still another 800 meters to go. This first bit was tough, but the stairs made it pretty easy. The rest of the hike had no stairs and most of the hike was far steeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the hike was pull up to a wall of dirt and roots with some ropes attached to trees above. I can usually pull up steep ascents on hikes by myself, but these were far steeper than usual. I actually had to use the ropes. (And the ropes were absolutely necessary going back down.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail went straight up in parts, and then snaked around some small ridges of the mountain. Occassionally, the trees would open up giving &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7854_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7854_stitch.jpg"&gt;a beautiful view&lt;/a&gt; of all the mountains to the east along with a reminder of how far you've gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt like the hike took a while. But, in reality, it only took about 30 minutes from the rest hut to reach the peak. The peak forked into two separate observation points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning left at the fork and going south, you could see everything to the southwest of Hakamagoshiyama. There was the highway exit for Suganuma Gokayama Village, the exit I initially took to get here. Above the village, the highest peak was Hakusan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;白山&lt;/span&gt;, which bordered Gifu and Fukui prefectures. Closer to me were the mountains Ogasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大笠&lt;/span&gt; and Oizuru &lt;span class='ja'&gt;笈ヶ岳&lt;/span&gt;. Mt. Oizuru was the border of three prefectures: Gifu, Fukui, and Toyama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observation point had a lot of bees and large flies buzzing around. Apparently two weeks ago, all of the magenta flowers on the mountain were in full bloom. The insects could have been flying around trying to find any remaining ones still open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took my photos and moved to the northern observation point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After climbing the ladder to the top of the tower, you had a full 360-degree view of the surrounding mountains. You couldn't see Gokayama anymore, but all the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7957.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7957.jpg"&gt;mountains to the south&lt;/a&gt; were visible. You could also see all &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7930_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7930_stitch.jpg"&gt;mountains further to the east,&lt;/a&gt; too. Mt. Norikura wasn't in view, but I could see Shirakimine, which I hiked &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/shirakimine" title="https://theschlock.com/shirakimine"&gt;2 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I approached the observation tower, someone else was already at the top. A woman who was more than happy to talk to me. I was surprised that I hadn't met anyone yet considering the two other cars at the trailhead. Apparently, for seasoned hikers, Hakamagoshiyama is just the first stop on the hike of these mountains. Past the observation tower, you continue down the opposite side of the mountain and go up the western mountains to eventually arrive at the peak of Mt. Ogasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大笠&lt;/span&gt;. That was too much for what I had planned for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mountain views were great, but the view to the south was pretty special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole Nanto, Tonami, and Takaoka areas were visible. It wasn't too hot, but the humidity did limit some of the visibility. Apparently, you could also see over the western mountains and view Kanazawa, but I didn't notice it. Maybe I'll come back some day and continue along the western mountain ridges to see that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I snapped my photos and moved on. There was more adventure scheduled for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descending mountains is usually the easiest part of the hike, but that wasn't the case when the paths are so steep. I had to constantly hold on to ropes and branches to catch myself from slipping, and I often still slipped anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halfway down, I had some kind of cracking sound and then some guys shouting something. I stopped to listen, but the noise stopped. A few minutes later, I heard it again, but had no idea what it was. I reached an observation point and noticed &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7996.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7996.jpg"&gt;a few more cars next to mine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the mountain, I heard some more shouting. Eventually, I got close enough to it to understand the situation. In the brush, away from the trail and invisible to me, were two guys cutting through a separate trail. They were yelling out to each other as a safety measure. If one of them yelled out and there wasn't a reply, they would know the other person was in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A worker van was parked at the beginning of the trail, so they must've been construction workers making their way to an electrical tower, or something. The descent took almost the same amount of time as the ascent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8009.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8009.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8009_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my car, I took a look back at the mountain, but I couldn't see any trace of the observation tower or points along the trail. Everything was pretty well covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hakamagoshiyama was a really nice and semi-challenging hike that did seem like only the first step of a much longer adventure. It was only a side adventure for me, as I was really up there exploring &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="https://theschlock.com/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins"&gt;Hosoo Pass&lt;/a&gt;. It would be nice to return and continue along the ridges to view Ishigawa and Kanazawa on the west side. Being able to see the Sea of Japan from the mountains would be great, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timeline of the Hike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:25am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trailhead for Hakamagoshiyama&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013"&gt;36°25'54.3"N 136°52'47.7"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:35am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Rest Hut&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4294422,136.8788346" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4294422,136.8788346"&gt;36°25'46.0"N 136°52'43.9"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:05am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plateau Trail Fork&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4279707,136.8728114" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4279707,136.8728114"&gt;36°25'40.7"N 136°52'22.2"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:10am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;South Observation point&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4261869,136.8724235" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4261869,136.8724235"&gt;36°25'34.3"N 136°52'20.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:20am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;North Observation point&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4284536,136.8720321" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4284536,136.8720321"&gt;36°25'42.4"N 136°52'19.4"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:30am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Trail Fork&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4279707,136.8728114" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4279707,136.8728114"&gt;36°25'40.7"N 136°52'22.2"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:55am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Rest Hut&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4294422,136.8788346" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4294422,136.8788346"&gt;36°25'46.0"N 136°52'43.9"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:00am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Car&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427"&gt;36°25'56.6"N 136°52'49.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/hakamagoshiyama</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/hakamagoshiyama</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The full title of this building is the Former Higashinakae Elementary - Sugio Branch - Donohara Winter Branch School or &lt;span class='ja'&gt;旧東中江小学校杉尾分校渡原冬季分校&lt;/span&gt;. It apparently closed in 1972, but it was never torn down. The building has stayed abandoned since then, and the local farmers even repurposed it for storage of their farming equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, nature has completely reclaimed the wooden building with trees and vines choking the remains of the structure. The front of the building is surrounded with tall grass, difficult to move through. The entrance to the school is completely shut from vines. The back of the building has tall trees towering over it. Bamboo trees also surround the old school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From certain angles, it's hard to tell there's even a building back there. Apparently later on in summer, the plants grow so high that you can't even reach it. Right now it's only the beginning of June, and already it's a bit difficult getting to the actual building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a lot easier to move around the back of the building. The tree canopy prevents any of the grass growing. But, the back reveals that the building is in much worse shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The south end of the roof has collapsed, probably from the weight of winter snow. As the roof collapsed, it took the second floor, staircase, and back wall with it. Much of the electrical wiring of the building is now exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the wood work around the building, it seemed like the local farmers adding a bunch of bracing and other wooden beams to keep the building together. But, a lot of the wood looks like it's been chewed through by termites. Even though the nearby fields look like someone has still been using them, no one has seemed to touch this building recently at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school building looks like it had 4 rooms. The main room in the above photo was probably the office. The room leading off to the right was mostly likely the classroom. Then, there was a store room to right in the photo above, about the size of a closet. And lastly, a staircase that went up to another room. I don't know what they would've used that for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to folks on the Internet, the building finished construction in 1957, and in 1959, it serviced only 8 students, the children of the people living in this small farming plateau. 10 years later in 1969, there were only 4 students. It apparently closed in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back to the full title of this building, it's the Former Higashinakae Elementary - Sugio Branch - Donohara Winter Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;旧東中江小学校杉尾分校渡原冬季分校&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Higashinakae Elementary School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平村立東中江小学校&lt;/span&gt; merged with nearby school Shimonashi Elementary School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;下梨小学校&lt;/span&gt;. Both schools were part of Taira Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平村&lt;/span&gt; at the time, and the new school was named Taira Elementary School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平小学校&lt;/span&gt;. This school used the Shimonashi ES building, so the Higashinakae building was no longer used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side tangent, but in 2004, due to depopulation, Toyama (and many other prefectures at the time) restructured many of its outlying villages and municipalities into larger cities. Taira village joined the other south western villages together into Nanto City. In 2006, Taira Elementary was closed, but the building is still used every day as the administrative building for the residents. It also has the post office, a clinic, and a few stores, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back in the day, many of the schools (especially elementary schools) in remote areas had branch schools. Branch schools were mainly used in winter when traveling was difficult. It was much easier for a teacher or two to travel and stay there for a week, rather than the students of the area traveling to the main school building every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugio Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;杉尾分校&lt;/span&gt; was in the Sugio neighborhood area further north down the river. The Donohara neighborhood was between Sugio and Higashinakae, and apparently it was too far for those 8 students to go to either school, so the Donohara Winter Branch School &lt;span class='ja'&gt;渡原冬季分校&lt;/span&gt; was built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny area of Donohara is a plataeu above the main road going along the river down to the main Nanto City. Getting to this small area isn't too bad with my Kei car, but I'm not quite sure how a 1950s bus could safely get up here. Maybe they used a smaller bus to navigate the narrow winding road? Or maybe the students just met the bus at the bottom of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrow road leading to Donohara overlooks the Owatari Bridge &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大渡橋&lt;/span&gt;, which was opened in 1958, only a year after the Winter Branch School was built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously in summer it's pretty easy to move around, but in winter, I imagine they probably don't even plow this narrow road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through photos from just a few years ago, I think the damage to the school building is very recent. Maybe it happened this winter? I wonder how much longer until they completely remove the building. Although, it's remote enough that it'll probably stay until it becomes an actual hazard, or someone buys the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/donohara-winter-branch-school</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/donohara-winter-branch-school</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Norikura Kougen Photo Rogaining</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Mt. Norikura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;乗鞍岳&lt;/span&gt; is one of the most recognizable mountains in the Northern Alps of central Japan. Living in Takayama, every day I see the distinct saddle shape of its peaks, which is where its name comes from. I'm always viewing the mountain from the west, though. This past weekend, there was a Photo Rogaining event held on its east side, at Norikura Kougen &lt;span class='ja'&gt;乗鞍高原&lt;/span&gt;, in Nagano prefecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a single narrow road that connects Takayama to Matsumoto in the east, and Norikura Kougen is a ski resort area accessible by one of the many innocuous side roads along this path. And this area is truly a resort. There are so many beautiful massive homes, hotels, and businesses built around the 70s to 90s. But now many of them look empty and left to rot. The whole area feels like a time capsule of Japan's booming economic days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7409.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7409.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7409_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my second Photo Rogaining event. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining"&gt;The Takayama Rogaining event&lt;/a&gt; last year was my first one, and I am totally hooked on these now. Photo Orienteering is perhaps a better term for this kind of event (or a Photo Scavenger Hunt). The race has a determined time limit. You are given a map and set of checkpoints 20 minutes prior to the start. Given the map, you are to design your own course and try to "collect" as many checkpoints as possible. Each checkpoint has its own point total, and each checkpoint has a photo which you are meant to recreate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The furthest away checkpoints tend to have the highest point totals. However, there are often many low point checkpoint clusters in specific spots, too. Understanding distances and travel times is important for initial strategic planning, but you must also be able to improvise changes depending on where you are and how much time is left. Also, being able to navigate and understand paper maps is obviously key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running my first event last year, I had the idea that taking big swings tends to be a better approach than cleaning up a bunch of the clustered points. So this was my main initial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7306.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7306.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7306_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7306_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7306_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reception for the Rogaining event took place at the Norikura Kougen Tourism Center &lt;span class='ja'&gt;乗鞍観光センター&lt;/span&gt; 2nd Floor. I arrived early enough even though I was stuck behind someone driving 30kph almost the whole way. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the start of the race, as part of the Norikura Kougen preservation efforts, we spent about 20 minutes deplanting as many dandelions as possible. Dandelions are an invasion species in this area, and it's the duty of those walking the trails to help preserve the park. Throughout running the event, dandelions were everywhere, too, so I feel pretty sorry for the park rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the time finally came, and we got our map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RbP1lGW31R4jdP2-dcbbiduslJ8HnJD/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RbP1lGW31R4jdP2-dcbbiduslJ8HnJD/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/norikura_trail_day_2025_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/norikura_trail_day_2025_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/norikura_trail_day_2025_map.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RbP1lGW31R4jdP2-dcbbiduslJ8HnJD/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RbP1lGW31R4jdP2-dcbbiduslJ8HnJD/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/norikura_trail_day_2025_checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/norikura_trail_day_2025_checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/norikura_trail_day_2025_checkpoints.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From looking at the map, it seemed clear that the bulk of the checkpoints were to the east, and that I should probably aim for 141. So, my plan was to go immediately south, grab some of the mid points, then head east and grab all the points on the way to 141. Then, take the southern route back to clean up the remaining eastern points, and then figure out what to do with the remaining time. All of these totalled over 1000, so with those and then more western points, I thought it was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the plan. The race began at 12pm, and as the chime rang, it seemed like the bulk of the group was heading to the same location, &lt;b&gt;Point 31&lt;/b&gt; at the base of a hill on the bike path, marked as kanban &lt;span class='ja'&gt;看板&lt;/span&gt;, or signboard.

I went up the bike hill to grab &lt;b&gt;Point 65&lt;/b&gt;, another signpost &lt;span class='ja'&gt;看板&lt;/span&gt;, then double-backed to continue east.

"It's over this way," I said, but I was wrong. We continued down the street further and found the correct turn off, which lead down to the river and the waterfall, Sengenbuchi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;千間淵&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final eastern destination was Bandokoro Big Falls &lt;span class='ja'&gt;番所大滝&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;b&gt;Point 141&lt;/b&gt;.

Continuing past Sengenbuchi led to 4 or 5 floors worth stairs to climb back to the road level, and then another 7 or 8 floors worth of stars going back down to reach the photo point of the Big Falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7354.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7354.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7354_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7354_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7354_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7361.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7361.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7361_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;43 → 141 // (+184 points / 650 total)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had hit my biggest swing of the course, but now had to climb 7 or 8 floors of stairs to get back up to the street and continue on.

It was not. It was 3:05pm. Crap, less than an hour left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan had been to get Point 123, double back to get Point 95, and then get to the road up there and continue down. But there was a lot of elavation near Point 95, and looking at the hills to my west, it looked like a 20-story climb. There was no way I could do that at this point. So, let's get 123 and get back to base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a little fumbling in the woods, but I found &lt;b&gt;Point 123&lt;/b&gt;, another signpost &lt;span class='ja'&gt;道標&lt;/span&gt;. Now, it was time to move move move to the finish line. &lt;b&gt;Point 63&lt;/b&gt; was on the way, but I didn't think I had the time to grab it.

I no longer needed that map, and I could use Google Maps to determine my remaining distance. Oh shit. I had to cover 3km in 30 minutes. Not impossible as I could routinely do 5km in around 35 minutes, but that was at the beginning of a race not the end. Usually by the end of marathons I'm getting around 11 minutes per kilometer, and Google Maps said it would take 35 minutes by walking. I could not walk the whole way. I had to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, move I did. I went right past Point 35 and Point 61, so I did not have to go out of my way earlier to get them. And I reached the finish line at &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7394.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_7394.jpg"&gt;3 hours 53 minutes 51 seconds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have optimized my path a bit more, but that is ultimately the challenge of Photo Rogaining / Orienteering. Understanding time and distance is fundamental. Actually, looking at the map now, there's a distance indicator at the bottom that I should have paid attention to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe with some optimizations, I could have squeezed out one more location, but I was happy that I made it to the finish line with only minutes to spare. Much better than the 18 minutes to spare from the last race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, even if I had squeezed out another checkpoint, I would have not even come close to the try-hards at the top of the charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_2077_stitch_t.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_2077_stitch_t.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_2077_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_2077_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250531_rogaining/IMG_2077_stitch.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barring one guy who was DNF or didn't show, I was last in my division. Many of the dudes in the Men's Solo division were 20-year-olds who seemed like professionals. All the casual runners were in groups, and my score placed in the middle of all those groups. 11 out of 12 for Men's Solo, and 23 out of 35 for all teams and solos combined. The one woman who I often saw was just 25 points ahead of me, she got 3rd place in Women's Solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the max score for the event was 2500 points and Men's #1 and #2 both cleared 2200 points, which seems impossible. I did not consider achieving anything close to the max score possible for this event. Again, maybe I could've done better, but I pushed all the way towards the end and scored over half of the max total, so I'm pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, from the first event last year, I learned that I should take big swings and not focus on grabbing all the little spots along the way. But, while I did focus on going towards the big swings of 141 and 123, I still grabbed all the spots on the way, costing time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, more ideas for next time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/norikura-kougen-photo-rogaining</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/norikura-kougen-photo-rogaining</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category><category>Running</category></item><item><title>Horizon Forbidden West</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Horizon Forbidden West is the direct sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn. Horizon is set in the distant future after our society had somehow been wiped out. Humanity has emerged again and currently live in hunter/gatherer tribes sprinkled across the world. The world is now shared with massive robotic beings emulating the animals of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Horizon was first shown in 2015, it looked amazing, unique, and fresh. However, the series has been plagued by bad release dates. Zero Dawn released on Feb 28th, 2017, ONE WEEK before the Switch's release and Zelda Breath of the Wild. People only came to Zero Dawn later. And now with Horizon Forbidden West, it released on Feb 18th, 2022, ONE WEEK before Elden Ring, another massive release that completely overshadowed Horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite bad releases, Horizon is a tent-pole series for Sony and Playstation, and even recently they've released a Lego game about Horizon. People may not have played the games at launch, but they've definitely gone back to them, and ultimately loved what they played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm one of those people as well. After the DLC released for Zero Dawn in late 2017, I &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/horizon-zero-dawn" title="https://theschlock.com/horizon-zero-dawn"&gt;played through it&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately really liked the experience. And now, having played through Forbidden West, this series really deserves its place among the greats. It's a shame how much it is overlooked for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the most intriguing thing about Zero Dawn was the overall story and mystery of what happened to humanity. This was my biggest draw. What event caused our society to fail, how did these humans survive it, yet not know anything about it? And how did this robotic presence come to be? Zero Dawn answers all these questions through the eyes of our protagonist, Aloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story of Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy was born an outcast, motherless. She was found in a mountain by another outcast named Rost, and raised as his own daughter. Without a true family, she was never accepted in her tribe as a full member. As a child, while exploring mountains she fell into a cave and found a device called a focus. A focus is a metallic ear piece of the old humans. It's basically Google Glass, that allows you to scan things and show information about them. No one else really seemed to understand how to use it, but Aloy could figure it out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While playing Aloy as a child, you are introduced to the idea of the machine animals. Apparently, they were all peaceful and they lived together in harmony with the tribal humans. But recently, some of the animals have become aggressive and occassionally attack humans for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, Aloy joins the rite of passage of her tribe to become a full member. If she passes the test, it wouldn't matter whether or not she was motherless. She was able to pass the rite and become accepted in the tribe, but the tribe was attacked by a fanatical group who also had focuses. Now that she was a member of the Nora tribe, she was tasked to venture west and learn more about this group, and for her, why they had focuses,  how they figured out to use them, and why the machines have become more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the introductory part of Zero Dawn. From here, the map and the game opened up allowing you to explore the remains of the central United States. Much of the game's story was navigating the politics between the various tribes and solving their problems. This was the absolute most boring part of the game. Who cares about these primitive tribes... I want to know about what happened to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually Aloy stumbles into one of the factories underneath the surface of the Earth, still operational and producing the machine animals. These factories are known as cauldrons. Text and audio messages of the old humans point her towards the ancient ruins of the Faro Company. Here, she learns that we're now in the 31st century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1000 years had passed since the "extinction" of humanity. That seemed like a short time for life to evolve to the point of humantiy having tribal societies. Humans of the 21st were wiped out by the Faro Plague. The Faro Company had developed "peace-keeping" military robots that self-replicated and lived off of biomass. Smart. Let's make robots use living things as fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy also meets Sylens, the eventual antagonist. He is presented as a tinkerer and scholar trying to understand the old humans and how they built and developed all the massive buildings and technology of the past. He also wonders why the peaceful machines have become more aggressive. In recent years, not only have they become more aggressive, but many new machines have advanced weaponry and are built like war machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Aloy share information and work together to find out more. Aloy is eventually led to the main lab of Zero Dawn, and she finds herself, Elizabet Sobeck. Elizabet Sobeck was an old world scientist who led the project of Zero Dawn, a scientific project designed to terraform and repopulate the Earth after the Faro Plague. The core of Zero Dawn was an AI system known as GAIA, which operated with nine subbordinate functions, each having their own role in terraformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the subfunctions is APOLLO. After the other subfunctions birthed plantlife, reenergized and fueled oceans and rivers, and reintroduced animal and human life, APOLLO was meant to educate the new humans with all the knowledge of its databases, the sum of all knowledge and intelligence of humanity. This was meant to bring humanity back to its current state. It was deleted, sabotaged by Ted Faro, the same man who created the machines which killed all life. His idea was that humanity led itself to the point of destruction, so new life should follow its own path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another subfunction of GAIA was HADES. HADES' responsbility of terraformation is a reset. If the terraformation process had continued to a point where it's determined that humanity could not exist and thrive, HADES would be activated and begin destroying all life on Earth again, so GAIA could begin a new cycle and try again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy learns that 18 years ago, HADES was activated. This was the same day that Aloy was born, or found. Using the stored DNA of prominent humans, GAIA's subfunction responsible for creating life, birthed Aloy, a genetic clone of Elizabet Sobeck. Aloy learns that this was a defense of GAIA. HADES' first plan of attack would be to take over GAIA and immediately destroy all life. But GAIA deleted herself in defense, and birthed Aloy as her last action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy's sole purpose in life was to destroy HADES, restore GAIA, and allow GAIA to bring balance back to the world's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without GAIA, its subfunctions scattered themselves through the cauldron network on Earth. The subfunction responsible for creating the terraforming machine animals began to create aggressive and warlike machines to protect itself from any human threat. Without GAIA, HADES had to come up with other methods for the world to destroy itself, including showing itself to a particular tribe which began worshipping it as a god. This tribe then attacked Aloy's tribe at the beginning in order to kill her and prevent her from saving the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy also learns that Sylens was the founder of this tribe as HADES promised him all the secrets of the old world for his successes. The tribe's ultimate purpose was to connect HADES to GAIA's communication subfunction, MINERVA, allowing it to reactivate the Faro robots and destroy all life again. Sylens helps Aloy infiltrate the tribe and defeat them, but not before HADES had connected to a signalling tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall mystery is the most interesting part of the game for me, much of the game is spent helping the tribes of central US with their political problems and such. Throughout the game, you make a lot of friends and help a lot of people. So much so that by the end of the game, you are able to bring everyone together to fight and defeat HADES at the MINERVA Spire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With HADES defeated, it was able to run a final escape routine and its essence escapes, only to be captured in a mechanical lantern held by Sylens, determined to tortune it for its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game abruptly ends, but the DLC continues with a few more details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the DLC, Aloy travels north to a frozen area controlled by a single tribe. You later find out this is Yellowstone Park. You eventually find a separate subbordinate function of GAIA known as CYAN. CYAN's only purpose was to prevent the Yellowstone Caldera from erupting. Through helping the tribe and CYAN, you learn about HEPHAESTUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEPHAESTUS is one of GAIA's main subfunctions and it is responsible for creating the animal-like machines that help terraform Earth. When GAIA purged itself, its subbordinate functions were no longer controlled by her. They were able to assert their independence. So, in an effort to keep its independence, HEPHAESTUS started creating machines to kill humans since they were the only ones who could restore GAIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, when you save CYAN from HEPHAESTUS' grip, HEPHAESTUS disappears in the cauldron network. Unlike the other core subfunctions of GAIA, HEPHAESTUS is able to move its presence around the globe, making it nearly impossible to find and subdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, this is where the story of Zero Dawn concludes. It leads to a climactic battle with HADES in the end, but after the battle, the game ends. Sylens steals HADES and walks off, and you're left with credits. The doomsday signal was prevented, but there really isn't much closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I guess you learned everything there was to know about the mystery of life and extinction of Earth. You followed Aloy throughout her entire life from birth and childhood to adult, overcoming her isolation and discovering her true origin. There is closure to that story, as a cutscene plays when Aloy finds Elizabet Sobeck's home from a thousand years ago, and discovers the ancient remnants of her decaying bones. It is a touching moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while the ending felt unsatisfying because of Sylen's cliffhanger, the overall journey was really good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a great experience undercut by The Legend of Zelda taking all the spotlight. Both games are very similar, too, which lends to a lot of unfortunate comparisons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breath of the Wild is an amazing innovative open world experience. You can climb everything and naturally discover everything in the environment throughout your journey. Horizon is also open world, but you cannot climb everything, you don't have a glider to smoothly go down mountains, and interesting places on the map are automatically revealed to you through completing "towers" in the form of the Tailnecks. Horizon is very much an iteration of open world design compared to Breath of the Wild's innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again, I think the overall story of the world elevates it above other open world games. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, this post has focused on Horizon Zero Dawn, not Forbidden West. It may seem unnecessary but all this background story information is incredibly important as it's the entire purpose of the world and of Aloy's character. It's all stuff that I had totally forgotten in the 7 years since playing it, and when beginning Forbidden West, there's a 5-10 minute recap video that doesn't really explain all these details well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horizon Forbidden West picks up a few months after the ending events of Zero Dawn with the story assuming you keenly remember all the details of Zero Dawn fresh in your mind. Hostile machines are still appearing because of HEPHAESTUS and Aloy searches old ruin after old ruin looking for a backup of GAIA to restore her and make the planet whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every backup of GAIA she finds ends up being a trap set up by Elizabet Sobeck back in the day to prevent it falling into the wrong hands. Frustrated, Aloy reunites with her friends from the first game as they talk about the blight. In addition to the machines becoming more aggressive, plant life has now begun to decay. A red scurge has begun to grow from the ground that chokes out life around it. The tribes of the midwest hope to contact tribes in the west to find a solution, and Aloy agrees to go west as she found a hint that more GAIA backups are there, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never noticed this in the first game, so maybe it was never really there, but Aloy doesn't really seem to pay attention when she's talking with people. Obviously she has an isolated personality from spending the first 18 years of her life as an outcast having no true family. She made plenty of friends and allies throughout the course of Zero Dawn, but when talking with these allies now in Forbidden West, she's asking them questions directly and never really joining in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, being over 7 years after playing the first game, I don't remember any of them, and I didn't really care about their story at the time either. When they talk, I'm skipping through the dialogue just to continue the story. I don't really care about the details of their life, and what they've been doing since the final battle against HADES. And seemingly, Aloy doesn't seem to care, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialogue options also seem to push this narrative, since her questions ask about the details of the person, the family, or the tribe. She never asks about them personally, their feelings, or their ideas. She doesn't say anything specific to react. She presents a "face" that only seems to care about the "mission" she has in front of her. Throughout the events of Zero Dawn, she changed so many lives for the better by saving families and helping nearly everyone with their problems both big and small. Sure, Aloy cares about the good she did, but does she really care about the people themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never noticed any of this until one character at the beginning pointed it out to Aloy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erand was a key character in the first game who helped Aloy track down the fanatical tribe and fought with her in the end. Aloy changed his life by finding his sister's murderer, and giving him peace from his frustrated and closed off life. Also, perhaps giving him someone to care about in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lambasts Aloy for leaving at the end of the final battle without saying a word. After HADES was defeated, Aloy immediately left to continue her quest to find GAIA at the expense of all the friendships she had formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mission is obviously of the highest importance. Life on Earth still seems to decay and restoring GAIA is the only way to bring balance back. But, she is also a savior to the midwest tribal society and she has meaning and warmth to everyone she has helped. This is also part of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound somewhat selfish of him to ask, "What about me?" But when the savior, and also you as the player, skip through all the dialogue, only ask questions about specific details of the person's problems, and only agree to help because it's a question mark on the map, despite all the good you do, is there still value in doing something to change another person's life if you don't care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Erand mentions this, I notice that Aloy rarely ever keeps eye contact with the people she's talking with. She often looks away, and returns her gaze saying something generic to conclude the conversation. You might think this is some kind of bug, making the characters look more like puppets, but all the other characters (minor or major) keep their eye contact with Aloy when talking. They look at her when talking, and even show emotion when talking about something important to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting and dialogue is sometimes a little weird. They use a lot of modern common phrases and ideas, even though they're meant to be a primitive tribal society. Each dialogue sequence feels like it was filmed in The Mandalorian's green screen sphere. But the actors show emotion and keep eye contact. They are truly grateful for the deeds of Aloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy doesn't care, or doesn't know how to show she cares. She's mostly just checking boxes off of the quest log. Same as me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could really blow this out further and extend it to all role playing adjacent games. Do we really care about all the people we're helping in these games?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, just like the first game, I did not care about the politics of the tribal societies. I was just pushing forward because the game is super fun to play. BUT! This all changed when Forbidden West had its Planet of the Apes 2 (Beneath the Planet of the Apes) moment. Future Humans exist!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?!  A new mystery!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All life had been wiped out on Earth, and if anyone had survived, they wouldn't have waited 1000 years to finally emerge. In Zero Dawn, you learned of an ark which was meant to shelter human and animal genomes was being sent to the Sirius star system. This project was known as Far Zenith and the ark was called the Odyssey. The project was a failure, though, as it had malfunctioned and exploded in orbit. Well, apparently, this was false. A ruse to mask their success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the future humans (whom we call Zeniths after the Far Zenith mission) have their own clone of Elizabet Sobeck, the same age as Aloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens at the HADES testing facility after catching up with Sylens and destroying HADES for good. Deep within the facility, Aloy finally finds a working backup copy of GAIA still intact. She gains the GAIA backup, but her exit is interrupted by the Zenith's entrance. As Aloy hides, the Sobeck clone acquires the other remaining backup. With both backups removed, Aloy's hiding spot is exposed and you lock eyes with the clone for a moment, both somewhat reveling in the discovery of another you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment is broken as the Zeniths grab the other Sobeck. They identify Aloy as a redundant clone, and one Zenith stays behind to eliminate you. The Zeniths have a perfect shield, preventing any damage, and you barely escape the facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escaping danger and with one of the GAIA backups, Aloy moves west following a subfunction signal. After infiltrating the facility, you're able to reintegrate MINERVA into GAIA, and restore GAIA's consciousness. With a restored GAIA, you ask about the Zeniths, your clone, and how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Far Zenith mission was originally intended to seed life on a world in the Sirius system, 8.6 light years away. This would be done using the Odyssey spacecraft, an ark with all the instructions for life on Earth. It could be operated by a crew of 60 people. The rich and powerful elite of the 21st century then falsified its destruction and piloted the ship themselves to Sirius. Through technological advancements, they developed some kind of technology or therapy that allowed them to extend their lives indefinitely. We are not given any more information about that throughout the rest of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zeniths made it to the Sirius system and set up a colony on one of its planets. However, a geological event occurred which destroyed the planet and forced them to return to Earth. As such, they were the ones who sent the signal to GAIA and HADES to re-terraform the planet in preparation of their arrival, and they created a clone of Elizabet Sobeck to restore GAIA to its full function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are responsible for HADES in the first game, and ultimately, they are the catalyst for GAIA giving birth to Aloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also learn the despite defeating HADES and now restoring GAIA, life on Earth is still on the course of extinction because of the growing damage to the biosphere. You only have 4 months to completely restore all of GAIA's subfunctions or else the damage cannot be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAIA has nine total subfunctions. HADES has been destroyed. APOLLO was sabotaged and destroyed by Ted Faro one thousand years ago. And, you have restored MINERVA. This leaves six more subfunctions. HEPHAESTUS is one of the most important subfunctions as it controls the creation of the machine animals. With its control, robots can be made to repair Earth rather than attack humans. We encountered HEPHAESTUS before at Yellowstone park, and its now constantly moving through Earth's cauldron network impossible to contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAIA is able to locate three of the other five subfunctions, but the other two are completely silent. AETHER, DEMETER, and POSEIDON are not that far away, and by restoring these three, GAIA would have enough "computing power" to be able to contain HEPHAESTUS if plugged into the network, and this would be enough to stabilize and rejuvenate Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after 20 hours into Forbidden West, the map is completely open and our path to the end is defined. It's no longer just chasing lead after lead in a linear fashion, much like the first game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, GAIA's current location becomes our base of operations. Some of the main characters we've met so far move into the base, and are given focuses to understand the futuristic technology and the current threat to life on Earth. There are some friends from the first game, but many of the new characters are also misfits and outcasts who don't fit into their tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure of the game from here to the end really feels like Mass Effect. You aren't running around with a party like Mass Effect, but occasionally some of your friends will come with you on a mission. Back at the base, you can also talk with everyone about their thoughts on the current story, current missions, other characters, and about Earth. You get a much more complete sense of all the characters' personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as you meet more characters and bring them to your base, it feels like you're actually building something together. You're building a fellowship and a home. You occassionally have character missions which result in meaningful changes, like solving the blight and healing those lands, which in turn, results in changes to the characters. And while Aloy still asks simple direct questions, that feeling of isolation begins to go away as she becomes part of a family. Aloy shows more emotion when talking to her friends, and engages in actual conversation with them, even though sometimes it feels awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, the true catalyst for this change is the other clone of Elizabet Sobeck, whom Aloy eventually identifies as her sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After restoring one of the three subfunctions, Aloy receives a distress signal from the location of a subfunction you couldn't find before. You have no idea what this could be. Is it actually that subfunction? Or is it a trap from the Zeniths? Either way, Aloy investigates. One Zenith is at the location, but is killed by a weapon developed by Sylens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After killing everyone left, you descend into the facility and find the source of the signal in a stack of containment pods. It's the clone, alive, but unconscious. You bring her back to base, and you're able to talk to her after she wakes up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original purpose of the Far Zenith mission was to seed life on a distant world, so their ark, the Odyssey, housed DNA of all species on Earth. For humanity, it had samples from 200,000 individuals, including Elizabet Sobeck. The Zeniths used this DNA to create a clone, who they diminutively named Beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta was raised in near complete isolation. The other Zeniths never spoke with her, except giving her direct, cold instructions. On the Odyssey was a full copy of APOLLO, so Beta spent all day learning from it and studying it. There was one Zenith who sometimes reached out to Beta in private, but eventually that contact was completely cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta grow up never having anyone and never understanding warmth. A life very similar to Aloy's. Except Aloy did have a warming voice, her adoptive father from the first game, Rost. As another outcast, he never really gave Aloy love, but he still pointed her in the right direction, and died giving his life for her. This allowed her to keep moving forward, fighting the odds and overcoming difficulties. Beta was never given any opportunity for love or growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting, yet perverse idea to think about how the path of your life would change given a different environment, different people, and different situations. Without given any opportunity for growth or challenges to overcome, what kind of person would &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; be? Or with given incredible challenges and difficulties, would you be able to overcome them? And then, what kind of person would you be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So scared of the thought of failure, Beta is shocked and terrified at your progress of restoring GAIA. The Zeniths have a total of three subfunctions for their copy of GAIA, and you only have two now. She escaped thinking you'd easily be able to defeat the Zenith and she'd be safe. But, she panics at the uncertainly accepting it as failure. You try to help and reassure her, but it only causes more unease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your friends at the base eventually calm her down later, but you find her pessimism frustrating and defeating. Honestly, I think Aloy is doing pretty good with just a bow and arrow so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Aloy runs off to get the other two subfunctions and with each one retrieved, GAIA can stabilize more parts of the biosphere, and extinction is pushed off by a couple more months at a time. With the extra three subfunctions retrieved, Aloy and friends come up with a plan to capture HEPHAESTUS and integrate it into GAIA. While still pretty sure of their failure, Beta agrees to help with the condition that Aloy kills her if things go bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, things good bad. They successfully capture and integrate HEPHAESTUS into GAIA, but the Zeniths arrive. They steal GAIA and recapture Beta. Aloy cannot follow through with Beta's wish for death. A Zenith stays behind, kills one of your party members, and you are knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, you awake in a bunker, unharmed and free to roam. You meet one of the Zeniths as you emerge from the bunker in her home from 1000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Tilda. And she tells you about the past of the future humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zeniths successfully arrived on a planet in the Sirius system 300 years after their launch from Earth. They established a colony, but then indulged themselves in virtual reality. With their bodies becoming immortal, they could stay in virtual reality indefinitely, not noticing the planet's slow deterieration. With the planet's demise imminent, only 13 of them could escape on the Odyssey. Their plan was to return to Earth as it was the only other habitatible planet they knew about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still questions, though.. Why signal HADES to kill all life on Earth and reset the biosphere? Why not try to live with or understand current life on Earth before destroying it indiscriminately? Tilda says its because they're all evil and narcisistic. This is true, but this is more cartoony evil rather than intelligent evil. Beings of a 1000 years wouldn't be so stupid to simply rush into this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, why is Aloy alive? Why did Tilda save her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilda knew Elizabet Sobeck. They were briefly in a relationship with each other, but the relationship was one-sided. One day, Elizabet slowed and eventually stopped contact with Tilda, and Tilda was left never really knowing why. She thought of Elizabet as an amazing impressive person, and they had great times together, but it ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Beta, Tilda's feelings was complicated. She had the opportunity to raise a new copy of the woman of her desires. But she could only ever talk to her in secret and it could never equal. Beta grew weak and meek. To Tilda, Beta was a failure. This wasn't Elizabet. This wasn't even a fraction of Elizabet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on seeing Aloy for the first time, and studying her actions, she became infatuated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a different environment, different situations, and a different life, what kind of person would you become and what things could you achieve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy is pretty close to a super hero in the world of Horizon. She has overcome every challenge against her, saved entire tribes, and changed countless lives. She's strong, attractive, and younger than Elizabet was when Tilda met her. If you were hung up on your ex for 1000 years, and you saw how a different version of them became the savior of humanity again, how could you not become obsessed and enamored with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilda says that she'll betray the other Zeniths for you and help you rescue both Beta and GAIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the final assault is set. Tilda sneaks your party into the Zenith base. Sylens uses his weapon to disable the Zenith's shields. Beta releases HEPHAESTUS from capture allowing her to create machines to fight the Zenith's hordes of robots. Most Zeniths are killed in battle, and you have a final showdown with the Zenith who killed your friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aloy makes it to the command center of the Zenith base, following the leader. She rescues Beta from her virtual reality prison. The leader of the Zenith emerges, but he's killed by Tilda. And you learn of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zeniths were never planning on staying on Earth. They only arrived on Earth to retrieve GAIA, resupply, and escape in some random direction to find a new home. They needed GAIA so they could terraform whatever planet they found. And with all the data of APOLLO and the collection of DNA, they could create their new world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were running away because an entity was chasing them. Sirius wasn't destroyed because of a geological event or a super-nova or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was destroyed by Nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the future humans, perhaps the ones who developed whatever methods that resulted in their immortality, weren't content with their organic bodies. They thought that the true next evolution of humanity would downloading their consciousness into a digital form. A digital transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some humans completed this procedure and began life in their test environment. But, the project and experiment was ultimately abandoned, as many others were content with their virtual relaity lives. The human consciousnesses were left in isolation within the containment. Left to fester over centuries. Their hatred grew against their former colleagues and all of their sentience was replaced with this hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 years ago, this sentience figured out how to break containment and it escaped into the Zenith's virtual reality network. It began killing every Zenith. Only 13 of them were able to escape using the Odyssey. Knowing the Earth was the only place they could go, Nemesis sent the extinction signal to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the other Zeniths dead, Tilda asks you to come with her on the rocket and escape the Nemesis threat, but her manipulation is over. Well, if you won't go willingly, she'll just kidnap you, and she becomes the final boss. She doesn't need Beta to activate GAIA if she has you. After over 100 hours of side quests, grinding machine parts to upgrade weapons, and becoming incredibly adept at taking down high-level machines, Aloy easily defeats her, and kills her in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the Zeniths are dead. You've reacquired GAIA with many of her subfunctions. And, you've met the ultimate final boss of the next game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was pretty clever of the writers to have HEPHAESTUS be released because now we can still have aggressive machine animals in the next game to fight as Aloy brings together the tribal societies of Earth, educates them of the past and its technology, and somehow prepares everyone for the incoming threat of Nemesis, an entity that even the future humans couldn't defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, to be fair, the future humans, Zeniths, weren't prepared to fight Nemesis. It killed everyone while they were having fun in VR. Also, it used their future technology against them. The tribal societies on Earth aren't so reliant on that technology and also have time to prepare for its arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also learn the extinction signal sent to HADES stopped when you defeated it in the last game. Horizon Forbidden West ends two years after the events of the first game, so presumbly Nemesis has been in transit to Earth for 2 years already. It took the Zeniths about 18 years to get to Earth from Sirius (even though the intial trip from Earth to Sirius was 300 years), so maybe we have 15-16 years to prepare? Maybe less since they aren't going to age up Aloy to 35 years old for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Burning Shores&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story continues with the DLC entitled Burning Shores. After counting all the Zenith corpses, only 12 out of 13 have been found. One Zenith cannot be found and now there's a signal and energy surge coming from the south. In the first game, you are traveling around the midwest areas of the United States with a lot of Colorado. In this game, you continue west and go to Nevada, Utah, and Northern California, with distinct buildings and locations in Las Vegas and San Francisco. Burning Shores brings you to Los Angeles and Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note about Burning Shores is that the environments are far more detailed than the full game. While the main game runs on both Playstation 4 and 5, Burning Shores is PS5 exclusive, allowing the environments to look more detailed than before. Textures are richer. Lighting is more dynamic. On the other hand, you only have one complete environment to work with in Burning Shores, so everything looks pretty similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall story of the DLC isn't really all that special. Walter Londra, the remaining Zenith, went to Los Angeles. He apparently never liked his companions and was planning of separating from them and building a spacecraft of his own with rocket engines developed by his company in the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, he meets the splintered group of Quen, a Hawaiian tribe who you met in San Francisco. They also have focuses and their society was based on the knowledge they've learned from the resources they had. Londra appeared to the Quen as a god and indoctrinated some members into following him like a god. Whatever world he escapes to, he'd didn't want to be there by himself. He plans on taking some women with him to rebuild his society with him as their emperor at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you arrive in Burning Shores, you meet Seyka, a member of the Quen tribe, but doesn't quite fit in. Her life somewhat mirrors your life of being an outcast, but she has a family and her sister has come with her to California. Currently, her sister, Kina, has been kidnapped by Londra, and you work together with Seyka to rescue her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like before, I'm not really interested in this tribal stuff. I only care about Londra and how his story gives us more information about the Zeniths and the incoming threat of Nemesis. Ultimately, we're never really given any substantial information about that. We learn a little about Londra and how he sucks, just like all the other rich people. Londra falls back into the cartoony evil pattern. After a pretty amazing-looking final battle with a Horus, Londra is killed. Later, we learn Londra was part of the Nemesis project and his consciousness is part of Nemesis. Londra also theorized that 21st century weaponry could probably be used against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The few scraps of Future Past lore is disappointing. But, it turns out that the true focus of Burning Shores is Seyka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What?! Aloy kisses a lady?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the final battle with Londra and tying up lose ends in town, Aloy meets Seyka on a cliff, and Seyka says she wants to be with you. The game gives you 3 options: Yes, No, and This is too much. Seemed like a odd choice for just having a character joining you. If you say yes, then Aloy says she has feelings for Seyka, too, and they embrace and kiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this felt like it came out of no where. You are running through the DLC with her, killing a bunch of robots and people, and ultimately saving her sister and crew. But, the relationship never felt anything more than any other friend from the main game. You helped her out with some of her personal problems, but you've been doing that the whole game with all your friends. Even the 3-way choice didn't feel like it was going in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not too say the relationship doesn't make sense. It is totally within Aloy's character to have romantic feelings for a woman and even want a relationship. Elizabet had been in a same-sex relationship with Tilda, and Aloy never considered that to be anything but natural. Also, in the first game, Aloy had rejected the feelings of other men. I think both Erand and the Sun-King wanted relationships or marriages. Although, those relationships always seemed too one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, for such an important event in Aloy's life and something I would expect the developers to celebrate, it's shoved at the end of a paid DLC only accessible after finishing the main game, which it seemed like many people didn't finish because of the length. Then, it's also behind a "choose your ending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels more like fantasy rather than a moment that the developer's intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever choice you make, Aloy says goodbye to Seyka, and Seyka returns to her people, probably never seeing you again. So, this whole plot point seems like its thrown away, anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ending to Burning Shores was a bit odd, but the conclusion to Forbidden West was pretty satisfying. While I don't think Forbidden West hit the story highs of the first game, it was a far more well-rounded experience, and by the end, I cared much more about all aspects of the story compared to Zero Dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm excited for the end of the trilogy, but I think Guerrilla Games has an uphill battle making the game a success. To get the full story of Horizon, you need to play the games in order, and asking people to go through a 60-hour game and a 100-hour game to prepare is too much of an ask, even if its worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have made efforts to keep Horizon in public consciousness. They made that Lego Horizons game, along with a Lego model toy line. And apparently, they plan on making some kind of multiplayer game with the Horizon license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe next year, we'll get our first glimpse at the game. But either way, I'm certainly excited to see how they decide to end it. Hopefully, they can pull off a satisfying end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/horizon-forbidden-west</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/horizon-forbidden-west</link><category>Games</category><category>Game Specific</category></item><item><title>Nikoi Kougen Resort Ruins ニコイ高原の廃墟</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In the mountains of Miyagawa, one of the Hida City's valley villages, there are the ruins of a failed development project known as the Nikoi Kougen Resort or Nikoi Plateau Resort. The existing building, and only actual constructed building, was to be one part of a resort area including a gold course, ski resort, archery courses, rental villas, a hotel, boating pond, an amusement park, limestone cave viewing, and more. So many hopes and dreams that had ultimately failed before the first phase had even been completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's begin with the end of World War II. During the war, many ordinary Japanese citizens moved away from large cities as Americans targetted them for bombing. The Hida region was a convenient area away from Nagoya and Gifu cities in the south and Toyama in the north. As the war ended, Japan surrended, and with the newly established government from the US, people began moving back to the cities to rebuild and find work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the beginning of the rural depopulation for Hida, and the depopulation became exponential in the 60s when Japanese industry started to become a worldwide innovator, especially with TVs and cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area known as Nikoi Kougen used to be a small village called Nikoi-Daira with a couple of homes and a school. The school was a branch school of Tanekura Elementary School. Tanekura is the village/neighborhood west of the area along the river in the valley. Many of these really remote areas used to be mining or logging settlements. A village would build up around the logging location, the workers would have children, and then it would be too difficult for their kids to travel during winter to get to the main school. A branch school was then set up so teachers of the nearby school could travel up the mountain, stay there for a few days, and teach the kids. I talk about this a lot in the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools" title="https://theschlock.com/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools"&gt;Kiyomi School History&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The branch school was opened in 1952 to accomodate students. It then closed in 1962 probably because the settlement had folded. It could have folded from the logging company ceasing operations there, or because people wanted to live closer to their families, or because of increased technology, more powerful cars and trucks could go up there on their own in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1972, a construction company from Nagoya had purchased the land as part of an initiative in Japan to stop the depopulation of rural areas. The plan was to build those amusement areas mentioned above. Construction began in 1974. The first phase was to be concluded by the end of 1975, but the company went bankrupt in summer, partly due to the cost of building this resort area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only building that was completed was this triangular building, the resort's restaurant. It's grand opening was planned in Nov 1972, but that didn't happen. Apparently, there's records of a pre-opening event being held there, which meant that the building had been fully completed. Next to the triangular restaurant is a concrete foundation of another building that did not advance further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit to most of this information goes to &lt;a href="https://haikyo.info/s/8102.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/8102.html"&gt;haikyo.info&lt;/a&gt;. I came across this site a few weeks ago trying to find information about another haikyo site that I visited several years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a busy couple of weeks, I finally found some time to go up there. Monday of Golden Week had the best weather, so I left my house around 7:30am. I tried visiting the prior weekend, but the roads had been blocked. I went to the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/miyagawa-archaeological-museum" title="https://theschlock.com/miyagawa-archaeological-museum"&gt;Miyagawa Archaeological Museum&lt;/a&gt; instead, and the museum guide said that it would be fine to walk there. So, whether the roads were open or not, I had planned to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the road was still closed. But, it was a only 3.5ish-kilometer hike on a paved surface. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 500 meters into the hike showed that it would actually be impossible to use this road to drive there. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6190.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6190.jpg"&gt;A landslide&lt;/a&gt; had completely covered the road, taking a tree with it. Throughout the trek, several other trees had fallen on the road, blocking the path. Not difficult to walk through, but not possible with a car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of forest friends also showed up on the hike. I saw a few lizards, and I also met two mountain goats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Japanese Serow, a treasure of the forest. They are completely harmless and are considered a symbol of life in the forest. By the mid-50s, there were apparently hunted to near extinction, and a law was passed making them illegal to hunt. Since then, their numbers have skyrocketed to the point where they are no longer threatened. Sometimes they cause some problems for farmers, though, so the law was appealed in 1979 allowed farmers to cull their numbers in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only took about 50 minutes to cover the 3km stretch of mountain road to reach the front gate of the resort. Going past the gate and derelict pond and fountain, the road was now more open. And appearing through the woods, was the resturant of the Nikoi-Kougen Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building still stands after all this time thanks to its steel beams, concrete foundation, and aluminum (I assume) roofing. Many buildings from around this time has a similar metal roofing, and depending on the amount of snow in winter, the weight could bend and warp the roof, like what has happened with this restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is in an odd orientation. The entrance faces towards north in the direction of the road, but the road never meets it. The road and restaurant are separated by a stream cutting through the area. The road goes past the restaurant and a small bridge connects the road to the back of the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how patrons were supposed to access the entrance of the restaurant. Maybe there were supposed to be more bridges and walking paths along the opposite side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The triangle side of the building was meant to be fully glassed, giving everyone an open view of the nature outside. Now, all that glass is gone, and this half of the building is completely exposed. This area was one of many dining areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above photo is the dining area pushed back from the entrance. Maybe it could be sectioned off as a closed room for a party of guests? The door in the wall leads to the kitchen. This section also opens up in the main open area where small tables were probably set. You could look up at the second floor dining area from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt; &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt; &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After this, I went through the collapsing archway into a tiled room in the center of the building. This must've been the kitchen. Various pipes came up from the concrete floor. Maybe these were draining pipes for sinks?  There were more pipes on the walls. Looking at the wooden hoods above those areas, those were probably gas pipes for cooking ranges and stoves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several tiles has broken away from the wall, but many of them were still stronger affixed to the wall. Pretty good for a 50-year-old building no one maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt; &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The door in the back leads to a hallway with a series of rooms. The hallway has a door at the end that goes outside, so this is probably how they would bring in deliveries to stock their refrigerators. There's a square room which also has a door in the back of the building. This was probably the staff room, or maybe an office. There's a staff bathroom back here, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also the boiler room for water pressure, electricty, and heat. An electric panel was present that showed all the amps powering the freezer storage room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two other doorways of the kitchen led to another dining area. In the back of the room was a wooden frame on the floor. I was thinking that it could've been a bar, but it was probably a tatami floor. On the ground, there was several decades-old beer bottles and cans from other people exploring the ruins in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plastic tiling on the ground had split at its seams and began curling up. Other old work equipment and gear laid on the floor, decaying with the rest of the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a very big building and the only place left to explore was the second floor dining area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exploring ruins, you have to be careful of a lot of different things. Depending on how decayed the building is, parts of the building could collapse when you walk on it. Exposed nails, wires, and glass could cut, puncture, and result in infection. There's also the danger of inhaling asbestos, mold, or any other toxic material used in the construction of older buildings that could now be exposed from the buildings decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going up to the second floor increases the likelihood of something bad happening. I could fall through the floor. Or accidentally grab something harmful to keep my balance from falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upper floor was pretty small, though. And with the triangle roof gone and being completely exposed to nature, plants had begun to grow from the floor. I didn't see any roots of these plants from below, so the floor must've been pretty thick. Even so, I still stayed towards the edge of the room, next to the walls where support was the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inner wall of the room had completely decayed, so you could you see the suspended roof of the kitchen, the back rooms, and other dining rooms. There was an electrical outlet on the wall, but it's wires had been cut. There was also a dumbwaiter that connected to the one below next to the kitchen. That makes sense as the staircase was too narrow for anyone to carry food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first floor main dining area was very simliar to the second floor. With the roof gone, dirt had been blown in or carried by snow. And from that, plants had begun to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roof covering the rest of the building had been severely warped. Almost all of the wooden supports that had suspended the metal roof had become brittle, rotted away, and broken. Having to carry the weight of 50 years worth of blizzards resulting in meters and meters of snow and ice, the roof had been molded into its current melted-looking shape. Actually, many abandoned homes in the nearby village had similar looking roofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in May, there was still large piles of heavy snow turned to ice. They probably should've given the building more clearance from the hill. The windows on that side of the building were probably the first to shatter from the pressure of snow and ice. I suppose a building company from Nagoya wouldn't know that, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked through the building again, and then ventured out back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the office from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the back was a water reservoir, so the building could have clean water. There are no pipes or sewers up here in the mountains, so the whole building would've had to be self-sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a raised platform next to the restaurant, there was the foundation of a larger building that never made it past this initial stage. I don't think its been publically stated what this was supposed to be. It's pretty small for a hotel, so maybe it was living quarters for the staff? Or maybe it was a souvenir store?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After looking around at the foundation, I had seen everything I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left the area from the front of the building on the opposite side of the river as the road. This is where guests would have been coming and going. But there was nothing over here. The open area of the land just led to the river. Maybe they planned on making a bridge? The stream/river was a little wider than I had planned on, but a tree had fallen across, so I balanced my way across back to the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left the area the same way I had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nikoi Waterfall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one other feature of the Nikoi Resort that had some infrastructure. About 1km down the road, there was a waterfall with a walkway to view it from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the road, you could easily hear the waterfall and see its top. But finding the trailhead leading to the walkway was not so easy. It was much further down the road than you'd think. Also, there were no signs or labels. The entrance just seemed like every other curve in the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I eventually found it, though. Several beams of the railing had rusted through and collapsed. The walkway also seemed to move a little bit when I stepped on it. But, overall, it felt safe. It did not feel like it was going to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going across a few of these walkways, the final one went across a gap that gave the perfect image of the Nikoi Waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a tunnel at the end of the walkway. Apparently this led to a limestone cave? Or led to something interesting along a cliff? The sign it was only 134 meters long, but I couldn't see any light in the tunnel at all. Even after going about 10 meters into the tunnel, the ceiling was getting shorter and it looked like the tunnel had collapsed. F that, I'm outta here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a few more waterfall photos, but I went back to the road and then back to my car. The whole hike took about 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along part of the road, I was able to see the hydroelectric facilities at the base of the mountain, near where I parked. But, I was not able to see any of the road when I was back at my car. I took a few photos of what looked like a corner mirror sign, but on later inspection, couldn't find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm not really sure how the development company planned on making money from the Nikoi project. It's a nice area, but way too remote for anyone remotely rich to want to come up here regularly. The company probably saw the success of other areas in Nagano and thought they could do it here. But, nope. And they went bankrupt before even getting anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it's just another rotting relic of Japan's rich past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timeline of the Hike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7:30ish&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Left Home&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:20am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Parked&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116"&gt;36°21'14.5"N 137°12'41.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:10am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Front Gate of Resort&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3558944,137.2239177" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3558944,137.2239177"&gt;36°21'21.3"N 137°13'26.2"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9:15am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Building&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3534236,137.2283197" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3534236,137.2283197"&gt;36°21'12.3"N 137°13'42.0"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:00am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Left Building&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:30am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Waterfall Trail Head&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3538455,137.2179628" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3538455,137.2179628"&gt;36°21'13.9"N 137°13'04.7"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:35am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nikoi Waterfall&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3532169,137.2200632" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3532169,137.2200632"&gt;36°21'11.6"N 137°13'12.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10:45am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Left Waterfall Area&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11:30am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Back to Car&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116"&gt;36°21'14.5"N 137°12'41.8"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/nikoi-kougen-resort-ruins</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/nikoi-kougen-resort-ruins</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Miyagawa Archaeological Museum</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In the northern area of Miyagawa village, there's an impressive museum called the Miyagawa Archaelogical Museum. It is a collection of artifacts from the history of the village, including pottery and tools from ancient times, clothes and farm equipment from the Edo period, and items from the Meiji and Showa periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, less than 1000 people live in the village. Although, that number is difficult to determine because the village is just one part of Hida City. The totality of Hida City has a population of around 26,000, but the majority of its residents live in Furukawa and Kamioka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hida City was officially incorporated in 2004 as a merger of Furukawa, Kamioka, Kawai Village, and Miyagawa Village. Prior to the merger, the population of Miyagawa Village was 1140. Being a single municipality, the junior high and elementary schools were able to consolidate and merge as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call the museum impressive because Miyagawa is not very big, yet this museum has thousands of artifacts collected throughout the history of the village. In the main hall, over 16,000 materials are on display from the Edo, Meiji, and Showa periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first floor of the main hall is dedicated to items of the &lt;b&gt;Edo period&lt;/b&gt;. The bulk of the collection is farming and carpentry equipment, but there is also a huge assortment of items used for surviving the harsh mountain winters. Snow removal and travel is of the most importance in the winter, as is winter clothing for inside and outside of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the daily clothing of the people in warmer weather, too. They also had a few horse saddles, which did not look comfortable for either the horse nor the rider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these items had been tagged with the general year they were used and the location and family they were from, if that information was available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the back, a hallway led to an annexing building that focused on archaelogical digs of the Miyagawa region. Many decorative pots had been reconstructed from their excavations, and believed to be from some time between the Paleolithic and Jomon periods of Japanese history. (14,000 years ago to 2500).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, there are 1842 items on display, and perhaps more in the research rooms that are closed to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the museum to me was the second floor collection of items in the main hall from the &lt;b&gt;Showa and Meiji Periods&lt;/b&gt;. The Edo Period is obviously interesting, but I really like the Showa period as it bridges the gap between those old times and today. It's the building blocks of today's society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were some items from war, but the most interesting stuff was their massive collection of school items, especially their collection of elementary school diplomas from the last 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Miyagawa Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宮川村&lt;/span&gt; is now just a neighborhood of Hida City having merged together in 2004. But, Miyagawa Village itself was a merger of two other smaller villages, established in 1956. It was the merger of Sakagami &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上&lt;/span&gt; and Sakashita &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂下&lt;/span&gt; Villages. At the time, Sakagami Village had a population of 2400, and Sakashita had a population of about 1400. Again, today, Miyagawa has less than 1000 people, so they've lost 75% of their population over 75 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back even further in history, both Sakagami and Sakashita villages were also mergers in 1875, which was Meiji &lt;span class='ja'&gt;明治&lt;/span&gt;8&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年&lt;/span&gt;, in Japanese years. The merger was part of the overall Meiji restoration of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this merger, 4 elementary schools and 4 junior high schools were established for Sakagami &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上&lt;/span&gt;, Sakashita &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂下&lt;/span&gt;, Omukari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大無雁&lt;/span&gt;, and Tanekura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;種蔵&lt;/span&gt;. Later, the Omukari and Tanekura junior high schools were merged into Sakagami Junior High.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the oldest diploma (that I was able to read) in the case was from Meiji &lt;span class='ja'&gt;明治&lt;/span&gt;12&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年&lt;/span&gt;, which was 1879. The diploma was presented to Matsunosuke Maruyama &lt;span class='ja'&gt;丸山松之助&lt;/span&gt; for completing 10 years and 1 month of school. (There was another diploma next to it for 10 yeras 7 months for the same person.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diploma was issued by Sakagami Elementary School, but, again, being so early in the Meiji restoration, the location had a different name and even the kanji are now outdated by today's standards. It reads &lt;span class='ja'&gt;岐阜縣管下吉城郡坂上村坂上小學校&lt;/span&gt;, or Gifu Prefecture Jurisdiction Yoshiki Distirct Sakagami Village Sakagami Elementary School. It wouldn't be until the incorporation of Hida City that Yoshiki District would be abolished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the kanji really interesting. Gifu Prefecture &lt;span class='ja'&gt;岐阜縣&lt;/span&gt; is now written as &lt;span class='ja'&gt;岐阜県&lt;/span&gt; these days. And school &lt;span class='ja'&gt;學校&lt;/span&gt; is now written as &lt;span class='ja'&gt;学校&lt;/span&gt;. As part of the Post World War II government, many kanji were simplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a diploma from Sakagami Elementary again from &lt;span class='ja'&gt;明治&lt;/span&gt;16&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年&lt;/span&gt; or 1883. This is to another student of the Maruyama family, probably Matsunosuke's younger brother or sister. The official title of the school changed to &lt;span class='ja'&gt;岐阜縣飛騨國吉城郡坂上村公立坂上小學校&lt;/span&gt; or Gifu Precture Hida Province Yoshiki Distinct Sakagami Village Public Sakagami Elementary School. Hida Province and Public were added to the title. This person completed 9 years 6 months of elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 or 10 years of elementary school certainly seems like a long time. It wasn't until 1886 that Junior High schools existed in Japan, so prior to that time, the term "elementary" school was generally used to describe all public primary schooling. Anyone who wanted to be a teacher or some kind of scholar would move away and attend a high school. Also in 1886, "normal" schools were established, which focused education on a specific field of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I stared at the diplomas for a while looking at the dates and marveling at how documents from over 100 years ago were still preserved so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposite of the diploma display case were items used for these schools. One of the catalogued items on display was the sign board for Sakashita Junior High School. Several photos of classes were pinned to the wall besides it. One photo was of their school trip to Kyoto in 1952. Below was their school manual, and a few textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case next to the diplomas was filled was textbooks of the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this museum was pretty incredible. I didn't know this at the time, but because the museum is so big and Miyagawa village is so small, they can't staff the museum all year round. The museum is only open 30 days a year because of that. It's open 3 weeks around Golden Week, during Obon, and a few more weekends in September, October, and November. So, I was pretty lucky to stumble into the museum on a day it was fully open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I talked with the old man staffing the museum about some of the items and where the old schools were located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main area of Sakagami Village is now the downtown area of Miyagawa Village, which is where Miyagawa Elementary school is today. Miyagawa Elementary School was established in 2000, and these days only has 7 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, this is not the same location of Sakagami Elementary School. The old man mentioned that even though that old school had been torn down, the gym of Sakagami Elementary was still in town and in use today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was pretty easy to find. It's just down the street from Sakagami Station in the heart of Miyagawa. The building still looks really nice considering it was built 150 years ago. In place of the old elementary school, was some kind of temple. It's called the &lt;span class='ja'&gt;世界聖誠会&lt;/span&gt;, which Google translates as the World Society of the Holy Spirit. The temple is connected to the gym now, so they use it for something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a look inside, but everything was closed and all the shades were drawn. And going around knocking on doors didn't seem like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downtown Miyagawa had another relic, the Sakagami Village Post Office. Even the title &lt;span class='ja'&gt;坂上郵便局&lt;/span&gt; has its shadow still left on the side of the building. The doors were locked, but I could see inside through the windows. It seemed full of garbage, like old bicycles, wood panels, and other things. Maybe it was once used as storage for festival equipment, but nothing inside seemed useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sakagami Train Station looked pretty nice and modern. Maybe this was an effort of Hida City to try and get people to visit, but the whole place was deserted. Eventually an old man, possibly drunk, stumbled out of a nearby home to stare at me and figure out why I was snooping around. Eh, I was done here anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Miyagawa Archaelogical Museum is pretty special. And it's interesting how the museum itself seems to be a relic of the past when Japan had more time, money, and people to put it together. I wonder what other unique museums can be found up here in the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/miyagawa-archaeological-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/miyagawa-archaeological-museum</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Japan Travel Map Page</title><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite hobbies is traveling around Japan. I love discovering and learning about new and interesting places and their history. I have lived here for over 12 years now, but it's been almost 19 years since I first came here and became inspired to explore, take photos, and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been going through a lot of old unsorted, unprocessed photos and unfinished posts of travels. With nearly 200 posts talking about Japanese travel and locations, I wanted to see all these locations on a map. Through doing research about some locations, I found an open source JavaScript mapping library called &lt;a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="https://leafletjs.com/"&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt;, and I've added a page with all these links pinned on a map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the following link to view the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/map" title="https://theschlock.com/map"&gt;Japan Travel Map&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/map" title="https://theschlock.com/map"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Travel Page is a little bit of a work-in-progress at the moment, so the styles and features may be updated or changed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned about Leaflet from visiting &lt;a href="https://haikyo.info/" title="https://haikyo.info/"&gt;Haikyo.info&lt;/a&gt;. This site is a collection of abandoned places around Japan and whether or not its possible to trespass and explore. I came across the site when trying to find information about the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/red-factory" title="https://theschlock.com/red-factory"&gt;Red Factory&lt;/a&gt;, an old abandoned factory which was highly rated among ruins explorers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaflet has been super easy to use. Going through their &lt;a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html" title="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html"&gt;Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, their quick start guide puts a map on a webpage almost immediately. Plotting points is incredibly simple, too, once you get the geo coordinates. It gets a little more complicated when you want to use layers to filter certain points on the map, but it was really just an extra step. You can take a look at the code, but there's not a whole lot of special things going on underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, the Red Factory is one post in a series of posts from 2016 when my friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit. These posts have their own &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/keyword/fishy-chaos" title="https://theschlock.com/keyword/fishy-chaos"&gt;keyword&lt;/a&gt;, so you can view all 8 of the posts from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/japan-travel-map-page</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/japan-travel-map-page</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category><category>Webpage</category><category>Programming</category></item><item><title>Freeways</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After watching too much YouTube, I came across a streamer playing this game called Freeways. It's a pretty simple PC puzzle game where you draw freeways! As you click into a single map, the sides of the screen haves roads either entering or exiting the screen. Each road wants to connect to another road on the side of the screen, or to a building in the middle of the screen. To create the road, you draw it with the mouse. Right click for bridges!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you complete the roadways on the map, you click simulate and traffic pours into your roads. You are graded based on the complexity (difficulty) of the map, the amount of concrete you used, and the efficiency of the traffic, which is measured in its average speed through your roads. Occassionally, a map will have a score goal you should try to achieve. Getting the goal will unlock a photo of a real highway interchange to inspire more road building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YouTube channel I was following is called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RealCivilEngineerGaming" title="https://www.youtube.com/@RealCivilEngineerGaming"&gt;Real Civil Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently the guy worked in civil engineering for a while, and then quit to do YouTube stuff. His Freeways videos were fun because he often talked about the most efficient ways of building highway interchanges using the least amount of concrete and other strategies. After hearing about it enough, I wanted to try it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeways was released in 2017 for iOS, PC, and Mac. I started playing it in January. There was a sale so it was only $5. BUT! It just so happened that after 8 years of no updates, Freeways got a full new expansion on Jan 28th for free!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original game had 80 maps, and the new expansion gave us 81 new maps! So many maps! Many of these new maps were much harder than the original. Also, every map now had a target score to try and surpass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as another new feature, the game now had achievements! Only 4 achievements, though. Two of the achievemements were achieving all the goals on individual maps. The other two achievements were about surpassing a specific World Efficiency. World Efficiency is your grand total score of all your map scores on original and expansion maps. The original map efficiency score was 25000. The expansion map efficiency score was 40000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 3 months, I finally finished all of the new maps, and got all the achievements. Here are the maps of my roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeways is a fun game. The original maps are pretty easy and fun to run through. The expansion maps get pretty challenging and sometimes very hard and frustrating. You can buy it on Steam, or directly from the &lt;a href="https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways" title="https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways"&gt;developer on itch.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we'll get another 80 maps in 8 years again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/freeways</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/freeways</link><category>Games</category><category>Game Specific</category></item><item><title>Battle of Sekigahara 関ヶ原の戦い</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Sekigahara is considered the most decisive battle in Japanese history. It was fought between the Western Army led by Ishida Mitsunari on behalf of the newly established somewhat traditional government of Japan, and Tokugawa Ieyasu who considered Japan weak to outsiders and wanted to establish a new government. Tokugawa won the battle, and after establishing a new government brought forth 250 years of peace and prosperity. This stability led to a sharp increase in population, education, and overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle happened on October 21st, 1600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leading to the Battle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1500s, Japan was in chaos. The time is referred to the Warring States period, or Sengoku-jidai &lt;span class='ja'&gt;戦国時代&lt;/span&gt;. It's called this because Japan was in a constant state of civil war. In 1573, Oda Nobunaga led his army to the capital and overthrew reigning Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki. From there, his army spread out conquering the nearby kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of his conquest, he was betrayed and committed seppuku rather than be captured. This was in 1582. He was succeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi who continued the conquest, and brought all of Japan together as a single kingdom by 1592. He restored power to the emperor, but he was really the one in charge. In 1593, his second son was born, and planned on succeded him as grand regeant to the emperor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toyotomi died in 1598 leaving behind his 5-year-old son, and a council of regeants to teach and advise him until he was old enough to assume his position. This is where the TV show and novel &lt;b&gt;Shogun&lt;/b&gt; begins. Immediately after his death, the Council of Five Regeants begin scheming and allying to seize control of Japan for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shogun and The Council of Five&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shogun TV show is slightly different than history, and of course all the names have been changed. The Council of Five had the following members: &lt;b&gt;Tokugawa&lt;/b&gt; Ieyasu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;徳川家康&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ukita&lt;/b&gt; Hideie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宇喜多秀家&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Maeda&lt;/b&gt; Toshiie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;前田利家&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Uesugi&lt;/b&gt; Kagekatsu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;上杉景勝&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; Terumoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利輝元&lt;/span&gt;. Mori only became a member of the council because of his uncle's death a year prior. His uncle was &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Takakage &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小早川隆景&lt;/span&gt;, who is sometimes considered an honorary member of The Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately after Toyotomi's death, Tokugawa began a series of marriage pacts and campaigns to secure his family, despite it being forbidden by the council laws. Maeda was said to have been part of this conspiracy. &lt;b&gt;Ishida&lt;/b&gt; Mitsunari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;石田三成&lt;/span&gt; was one of the highest level bureacrats in Toyotomi's government. He considered Tokugawa's action a complete insult to Toyotomi's legacy and quickly aligned himself with Ukita, Mori, and Uesugi. He also had powerful friendships with &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Shima&lt;/b&gt; Sakon &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島清興&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ishida gained the support of many lords of western kingdoms, Tokugawa gained support from the east. One of his strongest allies was &lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; Nagamasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田長政&lt;/span&gt;, who was perhaps the best military strategist in Japan at that time. He was the chief strategist for Toyotomi. Ishida apparently loathed and often insulted the military commanders, so Kuroda and six other commanders planned to assassinate him. Tokugawa actually quelled their attempt, and later recruited all of them in his Eastern Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several skermishes in the east and west pulled the armies together as they met in Sekigahara on October 21, 1600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Battle Stage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning of the battle, a thick fog covered Sekigahara. No one could see more than a few meters in front of them. But with the sunrise, the fog had disspated by around 8am and all the armies could see their opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Army led by &lt;b&gt;Tokugawa&lt;/b&gt; is red. They created a "fish scale" battle pattern with the main forces creating a line directly opposing the Western Army. &lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Takenaka&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;竹中&lt;/span&gt; positioned themselves on Okayama hill &lt;span class='ja'&gt;岡山&lt;/span&gt; in the north overlooking the battlefield. &lt;b&gt;Fukushima&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;福島&lt;/span&gt; led the main force on the frontline poised to strike first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Western Army is mainly blue, but also consists of the yellow and green armies at the start of the battle. They are multi-colored because of some key moments in the battle which led to their defeat. The main force was led by &lt;b&gt;Ukita&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宇喜多&lt;/span&gt;, one of the Five Regeants. &lt;b&gt;Ishida&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;石田&lt;/span&gt; positioned himself with &lt;b&gt;Shima&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島&lt;/span&gt; at the most northern on the army line on Sasaoyama &lt;span class='ja'&gt;笹尾山&lt;/span&gt;. Colored in blue, the furthest south is &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷&lt;/span&gt;, Ishida's other close friend. But, the largest army on the southern end of the west army was &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小早川&lt;/span&gt;, colored in yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the Western Army had around 82,000 soldiers compared to the Eastern Army's 88,888. Fearing Ishida's defeat, several lords who pledged support for Ishida did not attend the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Battle Begins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fog cleared, it is said that &lt;b&gt;Ii&lt;/b&gt; Naomasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;井伊直政&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Matsudaira&lt;/b&gt; Tadayoshi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松平忠吉&lt;/span&gt; of the Eastern Army ordered their gunmen to take aim and fire on &lt;b&gt;Ukita's&lt;/b&gt; army. &lt;b&gt;Fukushima&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;福島&lt;/span&gt;, frontline battle commander of the Eastern Army and who was promised first-attack by Tokugawa, became enraged and ordered his whole army to quickly join the fight against &lt;b&gt;Ukita&lt;/b&gt;. From Okayama Hill, &lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田&lt;/span&gt; noticed that the battle had begun, and fired his flare to signal all frontline Eastern armies to attack the West. The full engagement of the battle began sometime between 8am and 10am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Army moved in to engage the Western Army, and with the frontlines of both armies holding off each other, Tokugawa began advancing his groups from the far east of the battlefield to encourage his troops and also scare his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the while, &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小早川&lt;/span&gt; stood on the top of Mt. Matsuo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松尾山&lt;/span&gt;, his forces never joining the battle. Prior to the battle, he had made an agreement with Tokugawa through Kuroda. He would betray Ishida and join the fight as a member of the Eastern Army. But, he had yet to make any move. Ishida fired a flare signalling him to attack, but still he stood there with indecision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it wasn't until Tokugawa's troops fired some warning shots at him that &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; ordered his troops down the hill and attack &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷&lt;/span&gt;, the nearest of the Western Army. Otani was prepared for Kobayakawa's betrayal, but didn't expect several others to join him. His forces could not withstand their rush attack. Otani committed seppuku in the woods and ordered his retainer to hide his head to prevent it from getting into enemy hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the yellow armies were now members of the Eastern Army. Behind the Eastern Army, in the back, marked in green, were forces led by the &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利&lt;/span&gt; clan. They pledged to fight for the Western Army, but were prevented from joining when one of their armies refused to fight. And after seeing Kobayakawa turn, they knew that winning was hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;b&gt;Otani's&lt;/b&gt; forces eradicted, &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa's&lt;/b&gt; betrayal, and &lt;b&gt;Mori's&lt;/b&gt; neutrality, the Western Army had collapsed. The was no way for &lt;b&gt;Ishida&lt;/b&gt; to win. His friend Otani was dead. His other friend, Shima, was missing and presumed killed in battle. Four other battle commanders were also killed. He ordered a retreat. He, Ukita, and a few others escaped from the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihiro &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津義弘&lt;/span&gt; and nephew &lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Toyohisa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津豊久&lt;/span&gt;, leaders of their forces in the Western Army refused to turn their backs to the enemy to retreat. While the battle had mostly concluded by 2pm, they launched a surprise offensive to the middle of the frontline, piercing through the Eastern Army. And making their retreat to the south. The nephew was killed in this surprise attack/retreat, but Yoshihiro could escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Battle was over. The full length of the battle only took around 6 hours, although the main clash of armies only took place from Kuroda's signal flare to not long after Otani committed seppuku. Of the Western Army's 82,000 soldiers, 23,000 had defected and 35,270 were killed. The Eastern Army only lost 8,000 soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;After the Battle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fighting ceased, the remaining Western soldiers were either captured or executed. Tokugawa put down a folding stool in the field near his final encampment and performed the post-battle ritual called the Head Viewing Ceremony, or kubi-jikken &lt;span class='ja'&gt;首実検&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spot and so many other key locations of the battle have been preserved in modern day Sekigahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the location where Tokugawa sat as he inspected the heads. Next to this is a plaque which describes the scene:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tokugawa Ieyasu, fresh from his decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, sat here on a folding stool called a shogi to inspect the heads of the enemy commanders his allies presented. The heads, once inspected, were buried in two great mounds along with the corpses from the battlefield. During the Warring States Period, it was customary to mourn the dead of both sides, enemy and ally alike, so this inspection was also a gesture of respect for the dead.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia continues by explaining that the Head Viewing Ceremony was a way of mourning and respecting the dead of both sides, but it was also a way for victorious commanders and soldiers to get recognized for their valor in the battle, and get properly rewarded for it. This scene is illustrated at &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/sekigahara-warland#head-viewing" title="https://theschlock.com/sekigahara-warland#head-viewing"&gt;Sekigahara Warland.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the heads were inspected, they were wrapped in cloth and placed in one of two massive burial mounds along with the corpses of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the site of the Head Viewing Ceremony and Tokugawa's final encampment is the location of the new Battle of Sekigahara museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Battle of Sekigahara Museum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Sekigahara Museum opened recently in 2020, and while I consider the museum a must visit if you're going to Sekigahara, it is a very uneven experience. I arrived just as the museum opened at 9:30am. Tickets are only 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; which includes a theater experience, if reservations are not full. I was first on the standby list for the film starting at 9:45am. There were only a few reservations ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Museum Theater&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering the theater, you walk down a hallway with projected names of the wall of all those involved in the battle. The first theater is a trapezoidal room with a projected map on the floor. The map begins showing dates and events leading up to the battle. It shows a full map of Japan where Ishida and Tokugawa allies were located, and zooms in on the center of Japan as their forces begin to converge in Sekigahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As everyone entered the room and surrounded the map, the film was introduced by the guide and then it began. It quickly went through the leading dates and events again, and then showed Sekigahara. Each army, their commander, and their position on the map was introduced, and then the battle began as I had described it above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As each key moments of the battle played out, the armies moved on the map and clashed with their opponents. It was kind of like a strategy game, which became an incredibly effective way of showing how the battle progressed. The soldiers themselves were tiny little colored men, but the commanders of those armies were blown up giants when their key moments took place. They spoke their intentions with emotion and feeling which illustrated some intensity of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the battle concluded, everyone moved into the next, octogonal theater. This one had theater seating. I sat in the back and the film began showing the same battle, but this time, from the point of view of the ground rather than a birdseye view. The film was projected onto half of the room, giving us a 180 view of the battle. Fans mounted on the ceiling blew air at us and we sweeped around the battle. Lights flashed as gun fire erupted. And the ground shook and rumbled our seats as horses ran past. Once again, each of the key moments of battle were highlighted showing us the emotion of the commanders and their decisions which led to either victory or defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty hyped experience and incredibly effective at teaching us about the battle and those involved. Prior to the museum, I really only knew about Ishida and Tokugawa, and also knew about Otani committing seppuku. Now I knew about the majority of key commanders in the battle and what they did. I don't think I have ever visited a museum and came out learning as much as I had from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Museum Exhibit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theater experience is in STARK contrast to the rest of the museum. After exiting the theater, we rode the escalator to the second floor. The second floor exhibit shows the number of soldiers in each of the army, and then displays replica armor of each of the commanders. Shiny new looking armor, obviously not realistic to what they actually wore at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, several letters were displayed of correspondence between commanders leading up to the battle. I had no idea what any of these were at the time. They might be more interesting now that I've researched the battle in more detail for these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main exhibit of the museum was just a bunch of stuff that wasn't presented with a strong connection to the subject. It was completely different compared with the film on the first floor. At the end of the exhibit, there were some swords and guns that you could pick up to feel their weight, but it felt kinda tacked on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Museum Observatory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth floor gave a 360-degree view of Sekigahara. The museum was in the very center of town and the center of the battle, so you could see everything from this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking east is Mt. Nangu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;南宮山&lt;/span&gt;, the tallest mountain on the right, and in front of that is Mt. Momobukari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;桃配山&lt;/span&gt;. Mt. Nangu was where &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; Hidemoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利秀元&lt;/span&gt; stationed his encampment and Mt. Momobukari was where &lt;b&gt;Kikkawa&lt;/b&gt; Hiroie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;吉川広家&lt;/span&gt; stationed his. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not fully detailed above, but Kikkawa fought for the Western Army and was a member of the Mori clan. He secretly made a deal with Kuroda and Tokugawa that if he prevented the Mori clan from attacking, the Mori clan would retain all their lands after battle. Kikkawa kept his word and prevented the Mori clan from attacking, but the Mori had no knowledge of this neutrality. After the battle, Kikkawa was labeled a traitor to the clan, and the Mori was still punished for supporting Ishida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the base of Mt. Momobukari was where Tokugawa stationed his 30,000 men at the beginning of battle. Again, as the battle progressed, his army moved forward to the current position of this photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking just a little bit more north to the northeast, you can see Okayama signalling hill. This is where &lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; Nagamasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田長政&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Takenaka&lt;/b&gt; Shigekado &lt;span class='ja'&gt;竹中重門&lt;/span&gt; stationed their troops, and were they lit their flare signifying the begin of the battle for the Eastern Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to the north and the west gives a nice view of Sekigahara. In the distance on the right, underneath the taller mountains is the short Mt. Sasao &lt;span class='ja'&gt;笹尾山&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;b&gt;Ishida&lt;/b&gt; Mitsunari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;石田三成&lt;/span&gt; set his encampment. At the foot of this mountain is where the Sekigahara Tourism Center and &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama" title="https://theschlock.com/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama"&gt;Exchange Center&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Also, in the fields out front is the monument to the Battle and where some of the battle reenactments take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the forests to the west is where &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt; stationed his troops, and between Otani and Ishida's camps is where &lt;b&gt;Ukita&lt;/b&gt; Hideie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宇喜多秀家&lt;/span&gt; stationed his troops. The whole of what would become the Western army is lined up in the above photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of us, next to the cemetary and monuments is where &lt;b&gt;Tokugawa&lt;/b&gt; Ieyasu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;徳川家康&lt;/span&gt; set his final encampment and where he held the Head Viewing Ceremony to conclude the battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's not a whole lot to see to the south. The Sekigahara Manufacturing Warehouse obscures almost all of the view. But, in the background is Mt. Matsuo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松尾山&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Hideaki &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小早川秀秋&lt;/span&gt; stationed his troops, and eventually turned on the Western Army assuring victory for the East. Near the right edge of the photo are the forests where &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt; was stationed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation point is an amazing touch to the museum as it shows the real locations of the battle from the film earlier and also shows the scale of the entire field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, nothing really shows the full scale of the field than visiting each of the specific locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tokugawa Ieyasu's First Encampment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I traveled to Sekigahara, I left my apartment around 6:30 in the morning. I flew down the highway and arrived in Sekigahara around 8:30am. The first place I visited was Tokugawa's first encampment, on the east end of town, at the base of Mt. Mombukari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;桃配山&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2924_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2924_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2924_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2924_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2924_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the distance from the center of battle, I'm surprised he could see anything that was going on. You can barely see the Museum from here. Okayama, where Kuroda and Takenaka were stationed, obscures the view of Mt. Sasao, where Ishida was. You really can't see anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearby plaque detailed information about the location:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eastern Army commander-in-chief Tokugawa Ieyasu's forte was field battles, and in an attempt to lure Ishida Mitsunari and other Western forces out of Ogaki Castle, he spread rumors suggesting he would pass Ogaki, and continue westerly to take Osaka.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unnerved by this rumore, the Western Army departed Ogaki Castle under cover of darkness on October 20th and headed towards Sekigahara. They were followed closely by Ieyasu and around 30,000 troops before arriving at dawn on the 21st. Ieyasu stationed his troops here at Mt. Momokubari at around 6am. Irritated by early Western forces success, he is said to have drawn his sword on a retainer who had failed to dismount in his presence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In order to psychologically upset the enemy, and encourge his own troops, Ieyasu moved his command post to a more central position at around 11am.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Okayama Signaling Hill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After visiting the Battle of Sekigahara Museum and the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/sengoku-armor-museum" title="https://theschlock.com/sengoku-armor-museum"&gt;Sengoku Armor Museum&lt;/a&gt;, I was ahead of my planned schedule. Okayama was a clear vantage point for the town, so I went there next. Okayama is surrounded by a beautiful bamboo forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3248.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3248.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3248_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3248_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3248_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the forest is &lt;b&gt;Kotohira Shrine&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金刀比羅神社&lt;/span&gt; with an interesting local past. The plaque reads as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;During the Battle of Sekigahara, Lord Ikoma Kazumasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;生駒一政&lt;/span&gt; who had joined the Tokugawa army, set up camp on Okayama as the right wing of the Eastern Army together with Lord Kuroda Nagamasa and Lord Takenaka Shigekado. At this time, Kazumasa hung the statue of the Omononushi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大物主神&lt;/span&gt;, the diety of Kotohira Shrine (from his hometown of Kotohira Town in Kagawa Prefecture, called Sanuki province at the time), which he had been carrying on a pine branch and prayed for victory in the battle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After the Battle, the villages are said to have received this statue and worshipped it. It is also said that during the Keio period, the village headman of Sekigahara, Furuyama Ichiya &lt;span class='ja'&gt;古山一八&lt;/span&gt;, renovated the shrine's buldings. After that, the entire village of Sekigahara revered the god of business and the Kotohira-Ko &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金刀比羅講&lt;/span&gt; was organized. Every year on October 10th, a representative was sent to the main shrine in Sanuki (Kagawa pref.) to present a sacred talisman. (This is no longer done.) The shrine buildings were also moved to this current location in 1919.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own unique story to tell from the Battle of Sekigahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a little bit past the shrine, the bamboo forest opens up to reveal the view of Sekigahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3269_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3269_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3269_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3269_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3269_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could clearly see Mt. Matsuo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松尾山&lt;/span&gt; in the back, and the western forests. At present, you could not see Mt. Sasao &lt;span class='ja'&gt;笹尾山&lt;/span&gt; or anywhere that Ishida would have positioned his troops. Maybe the forest hadn't grown that much at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearby plaque had the following things to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the morning of the battle, Kuroda Nagamasa and Takenaka Shigekado stationed around 5,000 troops here on Okayama, with its panoramic view of the entire battlefield.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They lit a beacon at around 8am signaling the start of the battle, and commenced attacking Ishida Mitsunari on Mt. Sasao, but were repelled several times. Nagamasa later took a corps of men to the north of Mt. Sasao and attacked the Western headquarters rear flank.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Around noon Kobayakawa Hideaki and other former Western allies switched allegiances, attacking and bringing the Western forces down. Kuroda's army then destroyed Mitsunari's remaining forces.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kuroda started at the top of the Okayama, when the battle turned to the East's favor, I'm sure they all left this position to put further pressure on the West and eventually eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mt. Sasao &lt;span class='ja'&gt;笹尾山&lt;/span&gt; and the Battlefield&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned enough times by now, &lt;b&gt;Ishida&lt;/b&gt; Mitsunari &lt;span class='ja'&gt;石田三成&lt;/span&gt; was the main battle commander of the Western Army, and he stationed himself on Mt. Sasao. This was the northern most point on the battlefield, and also the north tip of the Western Army's lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3462_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3462_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3462_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3462_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3462_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like Okayama, Mt. Sasao gave Ishida a full view of Sekigahara. Ishida could see all of his armies on the west and also see all the armies of the east coming at him. Okayama's plateau was probably visible at the time, but if not, you could still clearly see any army coming from that location, with the exception of Kuroda's flank attack which went further north, using the forest as cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearby plaque had the following to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt. Sasao was the perfect defensive position, providing high ground and a panoramic view. Ishida Mitsunari's approximately 6,000 troops departed Ogaki Castle in the dead of the night on October 20th and set up camp here, around 1am on October 21, the day of the battle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The battle commenced around 8am. Mitsunari's troops, fronted by Shima Sakon, repeated repulsed attacks from the powerful Eastern armies, but were gradually forced to retreat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Western Army fought bravely, despite Shimadzu Yoshihiro, Kobayakawa Hideaki, and Mori Hidemoto failing to enter the battle, greatly reducing the Western Army's total fighting force.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hideaki finally switched allegiances joining the Eastern cause around noon, attacking and annihilating Otani Yoshitsugu's troops, starting a chain reaction that brought the Western Army down. Mitsunari's troops persevered against the advancing Eastern forces, but were finally defeated around 2pm. In the hopes of raising another army, Mitsunari fled west towards Mt. Ibuki.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says the Shimadzu was unable to join the battle? I don't know what that means, as everything I had seen so far has him in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Sasao was surrounded by battlements preventing horses from the climbing the hill and breaking Ishida's command post. Lines of these battlements were still set up on the path leading to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3446.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3446.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3446_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the base of the mountain, off to the east, is the Sekigahara Tourism Center and the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama" title="https://theschlock.com/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama"&gt;Exchange Center&lt;/a&gt;. Further out in the middle of the field is the monument to commemorate the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3436.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3436.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3436_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's certainly not the middle of the overall battle, but it could be the point where the Eastern Army reached before Ishida consider the battle a complete loss, and retreated in the forest behind Mt. Sasao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Battlefield Monument plaque had the following to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Although the Western Army was initially numerically superior to the Eastern forces, Kobayakawa Hideaki, who had previously pledged to betray his Western allies, remained a spectator to the battle, leaving Ishida Mitsunari to fight valiantly with less troops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Despite this, the Western Army fought intently with repeated advances and retreats until around noon, when Hideaki finally turned his allegiances to the East and intentionally attacked the Western Army, resulting in its total defeat. It is thought that Mitsunari and Shimadzu Yoshihiro's troops were then overwhelmed by the advancing Eastern Army. With Mitsunari's units soon overrun, the Shimadzu clan retreated from the front lines. Japan's largest ever and most decisive battle was over in a mere half-a-day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This field is where some of the battle reenactments take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mt. Matsuo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松尾山&lt;/span&gt; and Kobayakawa's Camp&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in the day, I had visited everywhere on my to-do list except for one place. I left Mt. Matsuo for last because I thought it would take the most amount of time. Compared with all the other locations, &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Hideaki's camp on the top of Mt. Matsuo was about a mile hike. The other locations were as simple as parking the car and walking up the stairs. This one actually took time in additional to the time stopped to take photos. Ultimately, it was only a 30 minute hike from my car to the summit, not really all that far afterall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3732.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3732.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3732_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3732_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3732_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plaque at the entrance had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt. Matsuo provided a panoramic view of Sekigahara and was therefore a strategically important position. Kobayakawa Hideaki stationed his troops here the day before the battle on October 20th.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hideaki had formed a pact with Eastern leader Tokugawa Ieyasu prior to this, but failed to take action once the battle commenced. According to some, Ieyasu is said to have fired matchlock guns at Mt. Matsuo to bring about Hideaki's promised defection.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hideaki finally commenced the attack on the Western forces around midday, first defeating Otani Yoshitsugu's troops destroying the Western Army. Hideaki played a major role in the Eastern Army's victory. He was awarded vast territories in Bizen, Okayama after the battle, but died two years later aged just 21.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hike up the mountain wasn't difficult at all compared to other mountains I have hiked before. This particular path probably didn't exist at the time, and the overall mountain may have had several paths more suited for horses and infantry movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit did give a great view of the totality of Sekigahara, so Kobayakawa was able to see all the armies engage each other in the middle and see all their movements. You can clearly see Ishida and Kuroda's positions at Mt. Sasao and Okayama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above plaque and other research says that Kobayakawa finally made his decision to betray Ishida when Tokugawa fired shots at Mt. Matsuo to force him into a decision. But, other scholars have pointed out that with the chaos of battle and general distance, there would really be no way for him to tell the difference between shots fired at him or anyone else in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaque at the top of the mountain had some other insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mt. Matsuo, located here on the border between Mino (Gifu prefecture) and Omi (Shiga prefecture) overlooking vital roadways from its 293m summit, has long been recognized as a strategic viewpoint. Prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, Western commander Ishida Mitsunari ordered maintenance work be done to the mountaintop castle as part of the preparations against the Eastern forces. The existing remains of the castle are from the time of these repairs. One day before the battle, Kobayakawa Hideaki led his 15,000 troops here to Mt. Matsuo and entered the castle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For much of the battle, Kobayakawa remained a spectator to the action taking place below, failing to fight for one side or the other until around midday, when he betrayed the Western side. Attacking Otani Yoshitsugu's forces, Kobayakawa brought about the downfall of the Western ranks, and provided victory to the Eastern Army.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A large area near the top of the mountain has been flattened, and is surrounded by a low earthen wall. The remains of a masugata gate system to prevent enemy intrusion can also be found. The ruins cover an area of around 400m east to west and 250m north to south, indicating that Matsuo Castle was one of the largest mountain castles in the Mino (Gifu) area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There used to be so many smaller castles in Japan, especially battle castles perched on mountains at strategic points. Nearly all of those castles are gone now, having been destroyed by whomever took them over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at the summit were 6 frogs hanging out in a muddy bit of water makin' babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, no matter whether Kobayakawa saw the warning shots or ultimately made the decision on his own after viewing the battle, his troops rode straight down the mountain and into the forest directly north to face the troops of &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Otani's Gravesite and Encampment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kobayakawa's encampment was the final place I visited in Sekigahara on that day, I went to Otani's encampment in the morning before going to the museum. I made it a point to visit his camp because of his story, but also because they placed his grave in the same forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2945.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2945.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2945_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaque near the entrance to the forest read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Otani Yoshitsugu's friendship with Ishida Mitsunari was well known. Mitsunari had confided his intentions to raise an army with Yoshitsugu, who had repeatedly requested he desist. Finally Yoshitsugu joined the Western Amry knowing it would be defeated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Receiving his orders from Mitsunari, he positioned his troops near here on October 9th. Kobayakawa Hideaki had stationed his toops on nearby Mt. Matsuo, however Yoshitsugu remained wary about the young lord, and prepared himself for Hideaki's possible turning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As expected, Hideaki defected around midday and attacked. Yoshitsugu at first fended off Hideaki's repeated assaults, but on being overrun, he committed ritual suicide.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path through the forest starts at Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine, then branches. The branch to the east leads to a view point through the trees which clearly shows Mt. Matsuo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2987.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2987.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2987_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2987_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2987_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the trees 400 years ago were obviously different, this still gave Otani's troops a view of Kobayakawa's troops and the Mt. Matuso castle. They could carefully study his movements (or non-movements) through the course of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not far away, the other branching trail led to Otani's campsite. This was on the cliffside overlooking the Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2998.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2998.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2998_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2998_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_2998_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaque says the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This site was Otani Yoshitsugu's headquarters. From here, it was possible to see Mt. Matsuo, where Kobayakawa Hideaki had stationed his army. Yoshitsugu remained suspicious of Hideaki's intentions and prepared himself accordingly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Too sick to ride a horse, he is said to have led his men into battle from a palanquin. Yoshitsugu's troops were prepared for Hideaki's attack when he defected around noon. Initially the Otani repelled the powerful turncoat forces, but were overcome owing to Wakisaka Yasuharu and others also turning sides.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must've been around here or slightly further into the forest where after being told that the battle was hopeless, Otani admitted defeat and committed seppuku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further into the forest was Otani's grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearby plaque tells the story of his demise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Otani Yoshitsugu was overrun following the betrayal of Kobayakawa Hideaki and his followers. Demanding that his head never fall into the hands of the enemy, Yoshitsugu commited ritual suicide and his retainer, Yuasa Gosuke, hid Yoshitsugu's severed head, before encountering Todo Takanori of the Eastern Army. Gosuke offered his own head in return for the location of his master's head never being revealed. Takanori kept this promise and never told Tokugawa Ieyasu the whereabouts of the head.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yoshitsugu's gravestone was erected by the Todo clan. The Yuasa family erected a gravestone to Gosuke besides Yoshitsugu's in 1916.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the gravesite is still regularly attended today. The graves had fresh flowers and were clear of leaves and any other debris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otani's loyalty and death at the cost of his loyalty is ultimately revered. He went into battle probably knowing that it would not turn out well for him, but he still stood by his beliefs in Ishida and his ideals of the Toyotomi government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near his grave, a monument was built to remind everyone of his sacrafice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaque reads:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The tactics and strategies of the Battle of Sekigahara were studied by Japan's armed forces during the late 1800's Meiji period, the early 1900's Showa militarization period, and military exercises were conducted on the actual battlefield.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This monument was erected in 1940 by the Fuwa Historical Preservation Society in memory of Otani Yoshitsugu, who's end was seen as the epitome of Bushido.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The summary is as follows: Despite his ignored advice warning Ishida Mitsunari against raising arms, Otani Yoshitsugu allied himself with, and fought hard for the Western forces out of loyalty to his former master, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whom he served alongside Mitsunari. Being outnumbered and having lost his battle, he sacrificed himself by his own hand in the true Bushido spirit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Battle of Sekigahara, people ultimately respect Otani and his sacrafice the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people seem to hate Kobayakawa, despite his actions causing Tokugawa to win and create peace and prosperity for 250 years. At the museum, each ticket is printed with a warlord. The person behind me in line got Kobayakawa on her ticket, and her date was teasing her the whole time. &lt;span class='ja'&gt;いやだ〜&lt;/span&gt;, she kept saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remembrance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason people love this battle and its legacy continues to this day with TV shows, movies, manga, and other media is that the decisive victory completely changing the history of Japan. After the battle and after Tokugawa successfully rooted out the rest of the Toyotomi loyalists, he had complete control over the country, and his dictatorship led to great prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the other big reason for everyone's interest in the battle is also its divisiveness. Tokugawa was an asshole who completely undermined Toyotomi's rule immediately after his death. It was an insult to Toyotomi and Ishida was very outspoken about this. Others who also hated Tokugawa's attitude continued to stoke Ishida into action, and the schemes and political bullshit continued from there. While Ishida was also a bit of an asshole, he represented loyalty and honor. Many of his friends and commanders in the Western Army were the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle was ultimately a fight between those loyal to the current ideals of Japan and the strength of someone wanting all the power for himself. It's far different than people remembering something like the American Civil War, which was fought over slavery, something clearly right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TV show, Shogun, portrays Tokugawa as an underdog with Ishida trying to keep all the power for himself, but in reality it seems completely different. Of course, Shogun isn't trying to be completely historically accurate, but it still becomes pro-Tokugawa propaganda. The show really contextualized Japan's xenophobia at the time as the Europeans seemed intent on conquering Japan for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a 2017 Japanese film based on a 1966 Japanese novel about the Battle of Sekigahara. It won a couple of awards, too, so I would like to see how they portray all the characters. Will they portray them in a neutral manor so the audience must decide which side was right? Or will they portray Tokugawa as a traitor to the current ideals of Japan or Ishida as a foolish conservative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After visiting the sites and museums, I am more on the side of Ishida in this fight, even though it is clear that his loss was a necessity for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revisit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am way more informed about the Battle than I was before having visited these locations, gone through all the photos, and looked up all the information online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are several more locations I want to visit, like Mori's encampment on Mt. Nangu, Shimadzu's and Ukita's encampment in the middle of the Western Army, Fukushima's encampment at the head of the Eastern army, some of the other local folklore museums in Sekigahara, and the Sekigahara visitor center at the station. I would also like to visit the Battle museum and Samurai Armor museum again with my now better base of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many minor lords who participated in the battle, too, who each have their story. Kanamori Nagachika &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近&lt;/span&gt;, founder of modern day Takayama, also participated in the battle with around 1,000 troops. I wonder if they placed a marker at his position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to check out the Battle Reenactment festival, too, so maybe I'll visit all these locations in October, if there's time. We'll see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Sekigahara Warland 関ヶ原ウォーランド</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Sekigahara Warland is an aging "theme park" which celebrates the Battle of Sekigahara. It first opened in 1964 and displays over 200 lifesize concrete soldiers recreating the atmosphere and intensity of the battle. Many of the major lords are present from the battle as well as several minor lords. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park feels like a forgotten relic due to its age and general lack of upkeep or any form of modernization. The concrete figures are a huge mixed bag of quality, from the general inhuman facial details, varying degrees of skin tones (from dark brown to yellow to white to pink), and warped joints (possibly from a lack of precise molding equipment). In addition, many of the key figures of the battle whose appearance is pretty consistent across the other museums in town are very generic here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, there are 60 year old coin machines at the entrance which no longer operate. There's a lecture hall whose doors barely opened. Inside the lecture hall, there's a diorama of the battle which doesn't seem like it works anymore. And the admissions desk was staffed by an apathetic old woman who seemed bothered and took her time selling me a ticket, and said nothing the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really feels like a burnt out 80s theme park from the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the concrete figures have nameplates underneath them identifying who the statue is meant to represent. Unfortunately, the education ends there. Warland doesn't offer any documentation on any of the figures in their park beyond a few posted signs. It's nice there is some identification but if you don't know who these people are, there's no immediate way of finding out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local people probably have a good idea. Also, maybe they offered some kind of tour guide for the park? There was certainly no guide when I visited on this Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mori Clan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利氏&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After entering Warland, there were several named statues on the hillside to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ankokuji&lt;/b&gt; Ekei &lt;span class='ja'&gt;安国寺恵瓊&lt;/span&gt; was a military monk who was close with &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Takakage, leader of the Kobayakawa clan and who would've been a member of the Five Regeants had he not died before Toyotomi in 1598. The Kobayakawa clan was a sub-faction of the Mori clan, and with Takakage's death, Ankokuji feared the Mori clan would be wiped out with the loss of a great leader. He was happy that &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; Terumoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利輝元&lt;/span&gt;succeeded in becoming a regeant giving them the strength to protect their survival, but this forced the Kobayakawa clan against Tokugawa as Mori supported Ishida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ankokuji&lt;/b&gt; Ekei became one of the top commanders of the Mori army and commanded his own army of 1800 troops stationed further east from the battle, planning on attacking Tokugawa's rear. In front of him was &lt;b&gt;Kikkawa&lt;/b&gt; Hiroie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;吉川広家&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's this guy. &lt;b&gt;Kikkawa&lt;/b&gt; Hiroie was head of the Kikkawa clan, also a sub-faction of the Mori clan. It is said that through his diplomacy and politics he was able to keep the peace between the sub-factions of the Mori clan after &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Takakage's death. On the day of the Battle, as mentioned above, his army of 4200 was stationed in front of Ankokuji and the whole of the Mori army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mori's retainers supported Ishida and the other Toyotomi loyalists, but it was clear to Kikkawa that they would lose the battle. Kikkawa made a secret pact with &lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; Nagamasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田長政&lt;/span&gt; of the Tokugawa army that if he prevented the Mori armies from joining the battle, the Mori clan would be spared and be able to keep their domains. So, when the Mori clan gave Kikkawa the order to attack, he refused. And his refusal prevented the rest of the Mori clan from engaging in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Mori, by the way, but not &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; Terumoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利輝元&lt;/span&gt;, who was one of the Five Regeants. This is his cousin &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; Hidemoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利秀元&lt;/span&gt;. Terumoto never joined the battle and stayed in Osaka Castle. Hidemoto was determined to support Ishida of the Western Army and brought 15,000 soldiers of his army to the battle. But, because of Kikkawa's inaction, he was prevented from attacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the battle, the whole secret pact fell apart because Mori never agreed to it. It was only Kikkawa who put forth the idea to Kuroda and Tokugawa. As such, the Mori clan lost 75% of its territories after Tokugawa became Shogun, and they labeled Kikkawa as a traitor. Ankokuji, still fiercely loyal to the Western Army, was executed in Kyoto with Ishida weeks after the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Head Viewing Ceremony &lt;span class='ja'&gt;首実検&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="head-viewing"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Battle finished and Tokugawa was the victor, he led the Head Viewing Ceremony. It was necessary for each soldier to bring the head of all his opponents he killed to the commander to pay respects to the fallen enemy and to get properly rewarded for his success in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3569.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3569.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3569_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokugawa set up his folding chair in the field and his commanders and advisors surrounded him. Here, Tokugawa sits and looks at a head brought to him for inspection. The deceased is identified, and the head is respectfully wrapped in cloth and laid to rest in a mound with his fellow soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the commanders around him were as follows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3571.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3571.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3571_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; Nagamasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田長政&lt;/span&gt; was the eastern's army chief military strategist. He signaled the start of the Battle which ordered the front lines of the Eastern Army to engage the west. Spotting weaknesses in the Eastern Army, he ordered his gunman to attack Ishida's troops directly, keeping them concentrated in the field ahead. But, more notably, he schemed with both Kobayakawa and Kikkawa to undermine the Western Army's strength and eventually destroy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3573.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3573.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3573_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3573_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3573_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monnashi&lt;/b&gt; Saburo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;門奈三郎&lt;/span&gt; is a member of the Monnashi clan, a military clan derived from the Fujiwara clan that I don't think existed at the time of the battle. I could not find any information about Saburo himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many others, but I didn't recognize the names at the time, and I could not find any information about the other names that I did make note of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ishida's Flank&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above two scenes, the park opened up into the full battle with its various localized skirmishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3595.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3595.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3595_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3595_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3595_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above, &lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; Nagamasa commanded his troops along with &lt;b&gt;Takenaka&lt;/b&gt; Shigekado &lt;span class='ja'&gt;竹中重門&lt;/span&gt; to cover Ishida's flank. Takenaka was 21 years old at the time of the battle, but worked closely with Kuroda to keep the battle concentrated in the field in front of them. After the battle, he captured &lt;b&gt;Konishi&lt;/b&gt; Yukinaga &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小西行長&lt;/span&gt;, one of the top commanders in the Western Army. Konishi was then executed with Ishida and Ankokuji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3603.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3603.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3603_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shima&lt;/b&gt; Sakon &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島左近&lt;/span&gt;, along known by a few other names, was stationed at Sasaoyama alongside Ishida's army. He was one of Ishida's best friends and Ishida used him as a leading strategist for the Western Army. He was known as one of the bravest generals in Ishida's army, so I'm not sure why they protrayed him as a goofball above. It is said that he was shot by Kuroda's gunman when they attacked, so maybe they modeled him after that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shima's body was never recovered after the battle, so we don't know if he immediately died of his gunshot wounds, or if he survived and lived a few more years in hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the main station of Ishida's forces. Ishida was in back, and this guy in the front has a nameplate, but I have no idea who it is. The closest person I could find was &lt;b&gt;Ujiie&lt;/b&gt; Yukihiro &lt;span class='ja'&gt;氏家行広&lt;/span&gt;, who used the nickname Kyuuasemon &lt;span class='ja'&gt;久左衛門&lt;/span&gt;. It's not perfect, but the kanji &lt;span class='ja'&gt;氏家久左衛門&lt;/span&gt; is pretty close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ujiie planned on joining the Eastern Army with Tokugawa, but with his kingdom in the path of the Western Army, he returned to his home and his family joined with Ishida. According to Wikipedia, he never joined the battle, so this is further confirmation it's not the right person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the battle, the Ujiie clan was dissolved, and Yukihiro became a ronin. In the shadows, he still supported the efforts of those still fighting against Tokugawa. He fought against Tokugawa in the seige of Osaka Castle in 1614, but committed seppuku when the battle was lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the open field, the Shimadzu clan attacks. They are pretty easy to spot with their circled crosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3618.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3618.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3618_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3618_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3618_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shimadzu clan army was split into two factions led by &lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihiro &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津義弘&lt;/span&gt; and nephew &lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Toyohisa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津豊久&lt;/span&gt;. Both were fiercely loyal to Ishida and fought with the same intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the distance is &lt;b&gt;Katou&lt;/b&gt; Yoshiaki &lt;span class='ja'&gt;加藤嘉明&lt;/span&gt;. Katou was one of the seven generals who plotted to assassinate Ishida after the death of Toyotomi. Kuroda was in this group, too. With the loss of the Korean war, Ishida wrote terrible performance reviews about them, calling them imcompetant for the loss. Tokugawa used this opportunity to shield Ishida from their wraith, but then gained their loyalty when it was clear he would war against Ishida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of fighting going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the front is &lt;b&gt;Fukushima&lt;/b&gt; Masanori &lt;span class='ja'&gt;福島正則&lt;/span&gt;, another one of the seven general alongside Katou and Kuroda. In the Battle, he was given the right to led the Eastern Army against Ishida's Western Army. However, Ii Naomasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;井伊直政&lt;/span&gt; and Matsudaira Tadayoshi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松平忠吉&lt;/span&gt; had their gunman fire on the Eastern Army prior to the start of the battle, which enraged Fukushima to start the battle immediatley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futher in the back is &lt;b&gt;Miyamoto&lt;/b&gt; Musashi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宮本武蔵&lt;/span&gt;, a legendary Japanese swordsman who eventually wrote The Book of Five Rings &lt;span class='ja'&gt;五輪の書&lt;/span&gt; detailing the essence of true swordsmanship in both technique, attitude, and personal philosophy. His ideals led to the creation of modern Budo culture. Scholars believed the he had participated in the Battle of Sekigahara and the creators of Warland thought so, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warland depicts Musashi and his father as fighting for the Western Army, which was the prevailing idea at the time as he was a longtime vassal of the Ukita clan. However, according to Wikipedia, after studying Kuroda's personal records of the battle, scholars have Musashi's father as serving Tokugawa's army instead. Scholars claim that having Musashi fighting for the West was always a romanticized ideal of him being an amazing ronin warrior fighting for the heart of Japan, but facts do not point to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kani&lt;/b&gt; Saizo &lt;span class='ja'&gt;可児才蔵&lt;/span&gt; was a commander in Fukushima's army. According to Wikipedia, he often killed so many men, that he couldn't carry all of their heads with him. As such, after their deaths, he would place bamboo leaves over their cut necks or mouths as his calling card. After the battle, other soldiers counted 17 felled opponents with bamboo leaves on them. His nickname became Bamboo Saizo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa's Betrayal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key moment of the Battle of Sekigahara when Tokugawa's Eastern Army's victory was assured was around Noon when the Kobayakawa clan made their intentions to defect from the Western Army, join the Eastern Army, and attack the southern flank of the Western Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3665.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3665.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3665_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Hideaki &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小早川秀秋&lt;/span&gt; was only 19 years old at the time of the battle and led the Kobayakawa clan. He brought 15,000 troops to the battle and was stationed on Matsuo-yama overlooking the whole battlefield from the south. As mentioned above, his father, Kobayakawa Takakage, was a high ranking member with the Toyotomi government and the Mori clan. He would've been a member of the Five Regeants, had he not passed away a year before Toyotomi's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Takakage's death, Hideaki became in charge of the Kobayakawa clan. As Ishida began raising his army against Tokugawa, Tokugawa grew seeds of betrayal with Hideaki. He claimed that Ishida was responsible for the embarassment he suffered for a defeat a few years prior. On the day of the Battle, Hideaki was still indecisive whether or not to go through with his betrayal. It is said that fake gunfire from Tokugawa finally pushed him into riding down the hill and attacking the Western Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiratsuka&lt;/b&gt; Tamehiro &lt;span class='ja'&gt;平塚為広&lt;/span&gt; fought for the Western Army against Tokugawa. Hiratsuka was loyal to the Toyotomi family, but was hestitate to enter a war with Tokugawa. Both he and Otani tried to convince Ishida not raise an army against him, but Ishida did not listen. His loyalty brought him and his 600 soldiers to the Battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiratsuka was the first army in the path of Kobayakawa. He was killed in the attack. His death is often over shadowed by Otani's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3657.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3657.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3657_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3657_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3657_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt; was great friends with Ishida, so it was only natural that he would serve his friend to the bitter end. Even though he tried his best to convince his friend not to war against Tokugawa, he did not abandon him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otani also had leprosy which made him severely ill. In public, he would wear a white hood to cover his diseased face. At the time of the battle, his disease had advanced to the point where he could barely stand and could barely see. After being told that the battle was lost, he committed seppuku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warland&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of major people, schemes, intrigue, and shere chaos and death of the battle is pretty incredible. Every major and minor person involved in the battle had some reason for their involvement in the fight and a consequence after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how much of this stuff was documented when the park opened in the 1960s, or how much this stuff was taught to the people who visited. In many ways, the main Battle of Sekigahara Museum is an evolution of this site, as it shows the build-up and progression of the battle using film and projectors. In comparison, Warland is a primitive way of showing almost the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's still an incredible place. The Battle Museum does show the intensity of the battle, but when you're in the field of around 200 lifesize concrete soldiers, you can feel the scale and chaos of the battle. Being able to walk around and view the individual people involved, and (later) being able to look up who they were, humanizes the battle, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that there isn't more education about all the named people in the park, but I think it's still definitely worth a visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 03:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/sekigahara-warland</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/sekigahara-warland</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Sengoku Armor Museum 戦国甲冑館</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Sengoku Armor Museum in Sekigahara is a private collection of real samurai armor. Often museums and other exhibits will use replicas or recreations of the original armor. The owner of this collection only collects and restores original pieces from the Battle of Sekigahara and the Sengoku period in general. Several of the pieces were owned by major lords in the battle, but not necessrily worn in the battle itself. Many of the other pieces were worn by soldiers in the battle, some of which were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The museum is just north of the main Battle of Sekigahara museum, and currently only takes reservations to view the collection. I emailed the owner the day before visiting, and he replied later in the evening saying I was all set to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewing the collection is 800&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;, but you could pay more for detailed lectures about each of his pieces and also try on some armor, if you're small enough. There's also an attached shop with some exclusive Sekigahara merch, and a small restaurant where the family will cook an "authentic" samurai meal for you. They also have a pet duck. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was only interested in the armor for this visit, but next time I think I'll go for the lectural experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately to the right after reception were 9 sets of armor, mostly consisting of foot soldiers. I'm not sure if any of these were used in the Battle of Sekigahara. In fact, the emblem above the middle set of armor is of the Fujiwara clan, which never participated in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fujiwara clan rose to power in the 800s, but another 800 years later at the time of the Battle, I think the clan had mostly been divided and renamed into other factions and eventually bred out of existance. One of their military branches was renamed the Monnashi clan, which did participate in the battle within Tokugawa's Eastern Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flags in the back have the Ishida emblem on them, and the front foot soldier helmets have &lt;span class='ja'&gt;石&lt;/span&gt; ishi written on them, so maybe those are some of Ishida's men? Although, they fought for the Western Army. Somewhat confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Displayed on tables on the sides of the entrance were assorted pieces of armor used in the battle. The owner noted that some of the pieces had dried blood on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3176.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3176.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3176_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3176_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3176_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his main room, there were around 25 sets of armor, many of which were related to the lords of the Battle of Sekigahara. He said it was alright if I took some photos, but his workshop with armor currently being restored was off limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first sections was devoted to &lt;b&gt;Ukita&lt;/b&gt; Hideie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宇喜多秀家&lt;/span&gt; and his army. The main armor in the back was samurai armor owned by the Ukita clan at the time of the Battle. It's most likely not the armor he wore in the Battle, but it was armor he owned at that time. In the front are two sets of army from soldiers in his army. They are distinctly recognizable because of the Ukita clan emblems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukita was one of the members of the Council of Five Regeants after Toyotomi passed away. He was very close to Toyotomi, so it was natural that he sided with Ishida against Tokugawa. One year after Toyotomi's death, there was an internal rebellion in the Ukita clan which resulted in several key members leaving to join Tokugawa. His army was slightly diminished but was still the largest army within the overall Western Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He survived the Battle of Sekigahara, although most of his army did not. He went into hiding, but was eventually captured and exiled to Hachijo-jima, a tiny volcanic island in the middle of the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is armor previously owned by the Otani clan. &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt; was a close friend of Ishida. He was also fiercely loyal and honorable. Despite being inflicted with harsh illness which blinded him, he still brought his army to Sekigahara to fight with Ishida against Tokugawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, his army was completely overrun when Kobayakawa defected to the Eastern Army in the middle of  battle and attacked his army. They were completely overwhelmed, and thus, Otani committed seppuku to avoid capture and also to show his loyalty to the Western Army. His retainers took and hid his head and armor, so the Eastern Army could not have the satisfcation of his defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above armor belonged to the Maeda family. &lt;b&gt;Maeda&lt;/b&gt; Toshiie &lt;span class='ja'&gt;前田利家&lt;/span&gt; was appointed as one of the Five Regeants after Toyotomi's death. Unfortunately, Maeda was also not in the best of health and died a year later. His son, Maeda Toshinaga &lt;span class='ja'&gt;前田利長&lt;/span&gt; succeded him, but fell into a political trap set by Tokugawa. As such, Maeda could not stand against Tokugawa and he fought for the Eastern Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is armor from the Mori clan. &lt;b&gt;Mori&lt;/b&gt; Terumoto &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毛利輝元&lt;/span&gt; was also one of the Five Regeants and pledged his support with Ishida in the Western Army. Mori's army was stationed in the east of the battlefield, and meant to swoop in behind Tokugawa's army and pincer them. However, when he was signaled to attack, he did nothing. After seeing the tide of battle shift heavily against the Western Army, he refused to attack and stayed neutral, sparing his men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He political standing was diminished after the battle by 75%, but faithfully assisted the Tokugawa Shogunate years after the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we have armor of the Shimidzu clan. &lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihiro &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津義弘&lt;/span&gt; and nephew &lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Toyohisa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津豊久&lt;/span&gt; were leaders who supported the Western Army. Their numbers were few, but had a fierce honorable spirit. After the battle had been lost, they refused to turn their backs to the enemy. In order to retreat, they ran a final assault on the front lines of the Eastern Army, breaking through, and continuing to escape to the south. Nephew Toyohisa did not survive the escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were more pieces of armor at the end of the room, but I have trouble identifying which armies they belong to. Some of the armor is pretty distinct, but there really isn't an easy guide to follow for identifying them. I should've taken notes or asked the owner about them, but I hadn't researched anything before visiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These last sets of armor were back near the entrance of the room. I think he mentioned that all of these armor belonged to members of the Tokugawa clan, which makes sense given the above emblem. &lt;b&gt;Tokugawa&lt;/b&gt; Ieyasu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;徳川家康&lt;/span&gt; was one of the members of the Five Regeants and the key agitator which led to the Battle of Sekigahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While TV shows and history sometimes paint him as a glorious unifier of Japan, he is incredibly cold, manipulative, and constantly schemes against his rivals. Immediately after Toyotomi's death, he began scheming a series of marriage pacts to increase his standing, something which was strictly forbidden by Toyotomi. He used other political schemes to blackmail other lords into fighting for him. Any opportunity to increase his standing or decrease the standing of another was immediately taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it seemed like many people hated the outspoken, garish attitude of Ishida, they hated Tokugawa more. Ishida went to war with Tokugawa to preserve the ideals set forth by Toyotomi. Everyone loyal to the deceased unifier of Japan held their ground, but were ultimately overpowered by Tokugawa's influence and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the battle, everyone loyal to Toyotomi was either executed, exiled, or significantly diminished. With full control of the government, Tokugawa banned weapons, shut down the country, and put to death anyone who would continue to oppose him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, he was a harsh dictator that people secretly hated and feared. On the other hand, his rule set Japan on a course of extreme prosperity the country had never seen before. The population exploded, literacy exploded, and culture exploded. Japan became a modern beacon of the world, which became quite popular in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having better knowledge of the battle and those involved, next time I go back to the museum, I'll have a better idea of what to ask about the armor and be in a better place to take notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The museum itself is really small. Again, calling it a collection is a better term, but it's still a worthwhile visit. The owner speaks English pretty well, so it's easy to have a conversation and talk about the armor and the battle in detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 02:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/sengoku-armor-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/sengoku-armor-museum</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Samurai Armor at Sasaoyama Center</title><description>&lt;p&gt;At the base of Sasaoyama in Sekigahara is the Sasaoyama Exchange Center &lt;span class='ja'&gt;笹尾山交流館&lt;/span&gt; as part of the overall Sekigahara Sight Seeing Information Center &lt;span class='ja'&gt;関ケ原観光協会&lt;/span&gt;. The Information Center is basically a government building where tourism for the town is run, but the Exchange Center is open for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3346.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3346.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3346_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3346_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3346_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exchange Center has lots of flyers for places around town, and costume rental. You can pay to wear some goofy samurai armor for 20 or 30 minutes, walk around the area, and pose for photos. Much of this armor is pretty generic, with various clan emblems on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the back of the Exchange Center, they had some premium costumes and authetic armor on display. Some of the armor was used in ceremonies and festivals in Sekigahara. The more authetic-looking armor were used in reenactments of the Battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above armor is a costume of what was worn by &lt;b&gt;Otani&lt;/b&gt; Yoshitsugu &lt;span class='ja'&gt;大谷吉継&lt;/span&gt;, one of the close friends of Ishida Mitsunari, leader of the Western Army. The armor is very distinct as it has no helmet. The cloth was used to cover his disfigured face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otani's forces were positioned in the western forest. At the time of the battle, he was inflicted with severe illness and could barely see in front of him. He committed seppuku after Kobayakawa betrayed the Western Army and attacked them as a member of the Eastern Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3369.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3369.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3369_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3369_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3369_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above costume armor was worn by &lt;b&gt;Fukushima&lt;/b&gt; Masanori &lt;span class='ja'&gt;福島正則&lt;/span&gt;. The bull horns are the most distinct feature of his armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the most seasoned battle commanders in the Eastern Army and led the front line against the Western Army. He was given personal permission to have the first strike against the Western Army, but Ii Naomasa and Matsudaira Tadayoshi took that away from him when their gunman fired. With their shots, Fukushima aggressively charged Ukita's army signifying the full start of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kuroda&lt;/b&gt; Nagamasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黒田長政&lt;/span&gt; wore armor similar to this costume. Big 'ol square head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuroda was Tokugawa's chief military strategist and perhaps the most cunning strategist in all of Japan. His army was stationed on Okayama, north east of the main battlefield and covered Ishida's flank, forcing him into the center of the fight. He also conspired with Kobayakawa to turn him against Ishida, ultimately allowing Tokugawa to win the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next costume armor is of &lt;b&gt;Kobayakawa&lt;/b&gt; Hideaki &lt;span class='ja'&gt;小早川秀秋&lt;/span&gt;. The red robe and trident ornament on the helmet are the most distinguishing features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kobayakawa was only 19 year old at the time of the battle. His army was the second most numerous in the Western Army, consisting of 15,000 troops. His troops stayed at Matsuoyama and did not engage in the battle until he finally made the decision to betray Ishida and attack Otani of the Western Army. As mentioned above, Otani committed seppuku as a result, and the rest of the Western Army quickly fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of his role in the battle, Tokugawa increased Kobayakawa's standing by giving him all castles and lands previously owned by Ukita, which included Okayama castle and vast territories in Bizen. Although, at 21 years old, he drank himself to death. He had no heir, so Kobayakawa was officially dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have a costume simliar to the armor of &lt;b&gt;Shimadzu&lt;/b&gt; Yoshihiro &lt;span class='ja'&gt;島津義弘&lt;/span&gt;. The leaping fox ornament of the helmet is its most distinguishing feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his nephew were members of the Western Army. After the battle had been lost, they refused to retreat by showing their backs to the enemy. So with the little manpower they had left, they charged through the center of the battlefield completely surprising Tokugawa and the eastern armies. They broke through the line and continued charging south to make their retreat. His nephew was killed in the assault, but Yoshihiro made it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the fancy replica armor, they had a few sets of armor that had been weathered to look more realistic. The above armor was made after armor belonging to &lt;b&gt;Katou&lt;/b&gt; Kiyomasa &lt;span class='ja'&gt;加藤&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;清正&lt;/span&gt;, distinctive because its one meter high helmet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katou was a member of the Eastern Army, but was not in the Battle of Sekigahara. He was battling and defeating Ishida's allies in Kyushu at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Katou's armor were a few more pieces. I could not identify the middle armor, but armor on the left is of the Monnashi clan. The Monnashi clan was a military branch of what was left of the Fujiwara clan. The Fujiwara clan came to power around the 800s, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of information about it at the time of the Battle. There was no Monnashi army, and I think this was just a commander in the Tokugawa army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few other pieces there too, used by actors in the reenactment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a fun surprise to see some of these after visiting the Sekigahara Battle Museum and Sengoku Armor museum. Even though these were costumes, all of the armor in the battle was pretty distinct, so you can usually identify it easily from its main characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama</link><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item></channel></rss>
