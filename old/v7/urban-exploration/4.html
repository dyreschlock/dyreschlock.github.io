| June 2, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I made my second attempt to reach Kiyomi Morimo <span class='ja'>清見森茂</span> by myself.  It's not too difficult to locate using Google Maps.  If you search for the neighborhood, Maps will give you a delightful outline: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d" title="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d">here</a>.  Looking on the map, there's only two ways to get to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>: come from the east, or come from the south.  My first attempt was coming from the east in which I ran into possible trouble.  Today's attempt was coming from the South, and going through the village of Shokawa <span class='ja'>荘川</span>.</p><p>If you follow the highway's frontage road south from the Hida Kiyomi entrance, about 15 minutes later, you'll come across a small farming neighborhood that has a road leading into the wilderness.  This road continues to follow a stream as it approaches Miboro Lake <span class='ja'>御母衣湖</span>,  Actually, right as that streams connects with the lake, you've arrived in the very southern tip of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.</p><p>Today, I drove to this neighborhood, and took the road into the forest.  After 10 minutes of driving, the pavement ends and turns into a rocky "dirt" road.  Still traversable, but at a much slower rate.  </p><p>As I continued through the forest, I actually came across some kind of neighborhood.  A house on stilts stood near this turn-off.  Looking at the map (36.081985, 137.002227), the road trails off but rejoined the main road not that much further, so it seemed like a "great" idea.  So, I decided to drive through this neighborhood.</p><p>The roads were actually paved, but were also totally covered by dried leafs, pine needles, some fallen branches, some fallen rocks, and some fallen trees.  Several times, I exited my car to clear the road for my car.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" /></p><p>I found 4 houses packed within this neighborhood.  Each house was on stilts, built in the middle of the forest.  There were no cars around, so I couldn't tell if anyone actually lived in them.  I would guess not.  At least not anyone of our society.  Bums or squatters could have been inside, but there's no way they could live without assistance from the outside world.  There were no gardens, or any livelihood at all.  Just an old house.</p><p>I did not pry.</p><p>However, Google Maps lied, and the roads that were certain to bring me back to the main road did not exist.  I turned my car around, and went back the way I came.</p><p>With that done, I continued on my way to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, and met my first obstruction: a big red gate.  The gates were at this point: 36.101633, 137.001209.  From the main road, these gates were about 23 minutes in.  Some other cars were already parked there, and an ashed fire pit was next to the white van.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" /></p><p>Past the gate was something I was very curious about.  On Google Maps, at point: 36.114263, 136.997079, the road is cut off as it hits a connecting stream.  On the other side of the stream, Maps marks a "walking only" road, which continues onward to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.  There's gotta be a bridge there, I thought.  Or some easy way to get across.</p><p>However, if the bridge was out, and I could walk across, Google Maps says it's about a 12 kilometer walk to where I considered a downtown area of Morimo.  Maps says that's a 2 hr 42 min hike, one way.  From my current position, I'm walking anyway.  But now there's an addition 2 kilometers to this possible bridge, which will add another 20-25 minutes.</p><p>Even though I needed to walk, I was still curious about the bridge, and walking that distance doesn't bother me.  So, I parked my car, grabbed my camera, ID, and water bottle, moved around the gate, and continued to walk down the road.  After 27 minutes, I reached that point on the map (36.114263, 136.997079), and HOLY SHIT!  The bridge actually exists!  Ha ha ha, I knew it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" /></p><p>But now I had a decision to make.  It's about 3:40pm.  I figured I could cover the 12k in about 2 hours at most, since it's a little more than half a half marathon length (23.1km).  That would get me back to my car around 8pm, I think, which is past sunset, and an absolutely bad idea.</p><p>I dunno… I couldn't simply stop, though.  So, I stupidly decided to continue.  I'll give myself until 5pm, then turn around.  Well, I didn't even last until 4pm when I came across an immovable barrier at point (36.119619, 136.988925), and immediately turned around.</p><p>As I turned the corner at that point, there was <b>a brown bear</b> in the middle of the road.</p><p>When I saw it, I thought it was a giant hyena, or some kind of wild dog.  It was big, though.  I'd say it was as big as I am.  It was facing directly at me, and it clearly and immediately saw me the instant I saw it.  My footsteps were making enough noise that it probably heard me coming.  I immediately recognized this situation as DANGER.  Without even thinking, I did a 180, and walked back the direction I came.  This all happened within a second.  The creature came into view, my brain said NOPE, and I am now walking back to my car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" /></p><p>I walked with the same attitude I had before seeing it to make it think I wasn't afraid or something.  And I was surveying the ground for anything I could use as a possible weapon if thing started stalking after me.  Also, I was still trying to figure out what I had just seen, and the likelihood of whether or not it would come after me, and if I were actually capable of defending myself.  Which was doubtful.  If that thing started chasing and attacking me, I'd be beaten down pretty quickly.  </p><p>And then I started thinking of that girl who was attacked by a bear.  And while the bear was eating her alive, she called her mom crying and panically explained the situation as it happened.  This one: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html">Daily Mail… sorry :(</a></p><p>After a few minutes of walking, and looking over my shoulder every couple of seconds, I figured it was far enough away, and that I could start running now.  I checked the time as well, so I could pinpoint this location later.  It was 3:56pm.</p><p>I made it back to Google's invisible bridge at 4:07pm.  Still no <b>bear</b> behind me.  And I made it back to my car at 4:28pm.  Still no bear.  Safe!</p><p>Again, I thought it was some kind of dog or hyena or something.  It had a long face, and body more like a dog or hyena.  Not a bear.  Or at least, the "bear" body image that always comes to mind.  Bears always seem so puffy.</p><p>Once at home, I started searching on Google to figure out what I had seen.  Apparently, Japanese wolves are extinct, and any wild dogs are no longer than 100cm (or 1 yard).  I searched for other wildlife in central Japan, and didn't find anything that fit the description in my head.  I searched for Japanese bears, and the following image is similar to the type of animal I saw:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" /></p><p>(This image was taken from <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387" title="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387">digitaljournal.com</a>)</p><p>It's pretty close.  It's hard to trust my memory since I only saw the thing for an instant, and even though I turned around, my brain was constantly fixated on that brief visual encounter.  Any details could be slightly skewed.  I remember that it's face was dark, and it's body was brown, somewhat light brown.  Though, it could've been in the sun, which made it appear more light.  Again, it had a thin slender long face.</p><p>It's still really early in the year, so it's slender features make sense.  Bears don't get their full "puffy" figures until the end of the year.</p><p>According to some other articles, most bears shouldn't attack humans, but HELL NO, I'm not going to put that to the test.  As much as I would like to return to this path with a full day and a mountain bike, coming across another bear is way too damn risky.</p><p>Also, brown bears are on the list of endangered species.  So, even if I do encounter another bear, and if that bear attacks me, and if I'm able to defend myself, and kill it, I'll have to pay some enormous fine, and probably go to jail.  There are stories about that ALL the time despite being self defense.</p><p>I think my next attempt in the wilderness of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span> will be under a more official capacity, and in a car.</p><p><br/>Anyway, the road to Morimo through Shokawa was quite beautiful. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka Gattan Go!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go">Kamioka Gattan Go!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 26, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The northeast most town in Hida City, is Kamioka <span class='ja'>神岡</span>.  It currently has about 10,000 people, but there used to be a lot more.  15 years ago, there were 30,000 residents.  Many of those people were employed in the various zinc mines throughout the town and region.</p><p>And then in 2003 (I think) the zinc mine were closed.  Apparently zinc was no longer as useful as it once was, and the companies sold, closed, or abandoned the mines in the area.  Almost all the staff was cut, and residents began leaving the town and moving elsewhere for work.</p><p>With the mass exodus of residents, it no longer made sense to keep the Kamioka rail line open, so on December 1st, 2006, the rail line was closed, and abandoned.</p><p>It's still abandoned today, and is a rather prominent and visible symbol of Kamioka's urban decay.</p><p>Today, these railways have a unique present to contrast their flourishing past.</p><div class='title'><b>Gattan Go!</b></div><p>These days, you can ride the rails yourself on a bicycle contraption.  A few years after the railway closed, the NPO Kamioka-town network NPO<span class='ja'>法人神岡町づくりネットワーク</span> opened the Gattan Go! service!  2 or more people can reserve one of these railway bicycles and journey along Kamioka's railway for about 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> to 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> per person.</p><p>This past weekend, a few ALTs and I reserved a 4 person bicycle, and traveled on the old Kamioka railway. :)</p><p>The railway course is about 3km to the end, and another 3km back.  It starts from the old Hida Onsen Station and continues to the Kamioka Mining Station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" /></p><p>Here's the old Hida Onsen Station, or <span class='ja'>旧奥飛騨温泉口駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>おくひだ</span> <span class='ja'>おんせん</span> <span class='ja'>ぐち</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>).  It's now the central station for Gattan Go!  Inside there's a whole collection of trains, and some old photos of the line before it was decommissioned.  There's a Cafe outside, and a few other fun things.</p><p>We arrived a little early, so we looked at the photo spread of previous railway riders, and photos of the railway in different seasons.  It wasn't before too long that riders began returning from the time slot before us.  Almost 10 groups continued to show up around the bend, and arrive at the station.</p><p>At 4:30, the "foreman" had everyone in our time slot move into the briefing room.  He went through all the rules.  No getting off the bikes.  No stopping.  Always wear a helmet.  Blah, blah, blah…  You could still take photos, but you had to do so while staying on the bike.  Not a problem.</p><p>Luckily, our American group was the final group to leave the station, so we didn't have to worry about keeping a pace for everyone behind us.

The station building was torn down, and removed.  The entrance gate is totally wide open, so anyone could easy walk to the platform, then take a look around the railway.</p><p>After continuing along further, we entered the first of two major tunnels on the route.  The first tunnel goes directly underneath the Kamioka elementary school.

The former Kamioka station building is now a hair salon.  I don't know if you can actually access the station platform anymore.  I think you have to go through the inside of the building, and it was closed when I checked.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" /></p><p>After we passed through Kamioka Station, we entered the second tunnel of the route, and this one is much longer than the first.

At this point, an attendant stopped everyone and turned the bikes around for the return journey.  We got to take a break, drink some water, and relax for a little while.</p><p>Before too long, we're back on the bike, and returning to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" /></p><p>Going from the Onsen Station to the Mining Station is pretty easy because the route is generally downhill.  It still feels really flat, though.  The return route is a fucking monster.  There were so many parts on the route where we kept peddling as much as we could, and we were still slowing down, and dragging.  I don't know if it was the bike we had, or if we're just that out of shape, but it was an actual workout to climb the tracks back to central.</p><p>We finally returned to the Onsen Station at 5:35.  A good 5 minutes late. :)  Good thing we were scheduled the last time slot of the day, and were the final group to depart.</p><p>Exhausted, and beat, we returned to our cars, and drove to a local yakiniku place for some delicious dinner.</p><p>Overall, it was a pretty fantastic and unique experience.  All of these old stations are pretty prominent in Kamioka, and after seeing them for the first time, I really wanted to get a better view.  Riding the bikes along these tracks was a great way to see everything up close, and take part of the history that was once the Kamioka railway.</p><p>As we finally departed Kamioka for the night, the tiny little castle shone beautifully in the darkening sky.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" /></p><p>Another way to experience the old railways is on youtube.  There's a few videos that people recorded from back in the day of the train traveling from the current Kamioka Inotani Station <span class='ja'>神岡猪谷駅</span> all the way to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p>This video was recorded in 1991: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY</a></p><p>And this one is quite a bit more recent: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI</a></p><p>In both videos, you can clearly see a whole lot of tanker cars parked at the Onsen and Mining stations, which carried all the zinc and whatever else they extracted from the Kamioka mines.</p><p>That first video is really helpful because it lists all the stations of the now abandoned line between the Inotani Station and the Onsen station:</p><p><span class='ja'>猪谷</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>茂住</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>漆山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡大橋</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨温泉</span></p><p>There's just 3 more stations outside of the central Kamioka area that are decommissioned: Hida Nakayama <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span>, Mozumi <span class='ja'>茂住</span>, and Urushiyama <span class='ja'>漆山</span>.  From the parts of the rail line we weren't able to ride on, there are some really beautiful bridges, and tunnels that are very very long.

I think this requires some more exploring in the future. :)</p><div class='title'><b><i>Update</i></b></div><p>Near the end of summer vacation, I went to these abandoned rail stations: <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-railway" title="/kamioka-railway">September 1st</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Yamada Elementary 山田小" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/yamada-elementary">Yamada Elementary 山田小</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And it too! had a governmental restructuring in recent years.  </p><p>In 2004, the towns of Furukawa and Kamioka joined with the villages of Kawai and Miyagawa to form Hida City.

This is <b>Hashima</b>, or, by its nickname, "Battleship Island".  It exists in the Sea of Japan just 15km west of Nagasaki City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" /></p><p>Coal was first discover on the island in 1810, and a small mining operation existed.  The first official mineshaft opened in 1887.  Production on the island didn't really turn into a massive settlement until the Mitsubishi bought the island, and increased it's magnitude.  At the height of its operation, the population of the island was around 5300 people.</p><p>After World War II, and the adoption of petroleum, people began to use coal less and less.  So with the demand waning, the island became more and more obsolete.  On January 15th, 1974, closed the last operating mineshaft.  And on April 20th, the last residents of the Hashima left the island forever.  The island remained abandoned and unkept after that.</p><p>In 2002, Mistubishi relinquished ownership to Takashima-machi.  And with a government restructuring in 2005, it now became part of Nagasaki City.  After years of work, planning, and construction, tourism finally opened on the island almost 35 years to the day it closed down, April 22nd, 2009.</p><p>May 2010 was the last time I had visited Nagasaki.  I went with Dave, and we met Ikuko who was very insistent that we visit this place.  So, we did. ^_^   Unfortunately, the weather was not very good, and I wasn't in a good position to take many good photos.  Here are the photos I was able to take: <a href="/old/v7/gunkanjima" title="/gunkanjima">May 19th, 2010</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Preservation</b></div><p>Up until Nagasaki's acquisition of the island, no attempt to upkeep or preserve the island had taken place.  It suffered from weather, rotting, and general decay for over 30 straight years.  There is massive concern from the city about the safety of the island, especially inside the decaying building.</p><p>This is why it took 4 years, with delays, to open the island to regular tourism.  And then, even on the island, tourists are closely watched, and the areas you can visit are very very minimal.  On the island, the walkway is as far the edge of the island as possible.  Far away from any of the residentially buildings, and any collateral damage if one of the buildings should collapse.</p><p>Nagasaki wants to preserve the buildings and other structures on the island, but the cost is too high for the city.  Constant tourism brings in money to help that, but it's still not enough.</p><p>In Nagasaki, right now, there's a massive campaign to have Hashima, and several other parts of Nagasaki, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  If successful, they should receive funding to further preserve the island, and make it even more accessible to tourists.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Tourism</b></div><p>So, last Friday, March 28th, was the second time I have been to the island.  The last time was May 10th, 2010, and the procedure was completely identical as it is today.  You buy passage on a boat from Nagasaki Harbor.  You take a cruise to the island.  The boat circles around the island for a little bit.  Then you land on the island, and a tour guide shows off the parts of the island you can see, and talks about the history.  You walk around on the very cornered off part of the island away from the decaying buildings.  And then you go back to the harbor.</p><p>Unlike the first time I visited, the weather was absolutely perfect.  Clear skies, clear water.  Absolutely beautiful.</p><p>Below is the front of the island which served as the actual mining facility.  This is where everyone worked, and where ships would load coal, and drop off supplies for the island.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3817.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3817.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3817.webp" /></p><p>Above is Hashima JHS and Hashima ES.  The first four floors of the building served as the elementary school, and the top 3 were the Junior high school.  While a school existed on the island before, the finished construction of this building is 1958 allowed the residents to consolidate all the schooling into one single building.  Though, the Kindergarden was still in a different connected building.  In 1970, the built a gymnasium, but it has since collapsed.</p><p>Right next to the school, and housing the kindergarden on the roof, was the most populous residential building on the island, No. 65.  It served as home for 317 families.</p><p>Below is the back of the island off limits to tourists.  It contains all the residential buildings and is the most dangerous part of the surface of the island.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3895.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3895.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3893.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3893.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3893.webp" /></p><p>Above is building No. 51, which served mainly as residential.  It housed 40 families.</p><p>Again, on the island, tourism is only permitted near the mining facility and far away from any of the more interesting buildings.  But you can still see some neat ruins.</p><p>In the second photo below, the building overseeing most of the island was where management lived on the island.  It was the only building on the island that had private baths.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3923.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3923.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3923.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3932.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3932.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3970.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3970.webp" /></p><p>And above is the closest you actually get to a residential building.  This was building No. 30 and was the second most populous building on the island for 140 families.</p><p>Here's the same place from 4 years ago.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100519_gunkanjima/IMG_7962_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100519_gunkanjima/IMG_7962_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100519_gunkanjima/IMG_7962_stitch.webp" /></p><p><br/>Anyway, it's a neat little escapade to take if you find yourself in Nagasaki, especially on a clear beautiful day.  Tourism is rather lucrative though, so you do need a reservation in advance.  It might be a little expensive, though, at about 4000<span class='ja'>円</span>, but I think it's interesting, and worth it.</p><p>And with Nagasaki campaign for UNESCO, the tourism on the island could completely change in the future.  ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takane 高根村" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takane">Takane 高根村</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Like many places, Takayama has many unique qualities that set it apart from other areas in Japan.  One of these unique qualities is that Takayama is the largest city in Japan by area.  It is 2178 km<superscript>2</superscript>, which is the size of most counties in Wisconsin.</p><p>It was only recently that this happened, too.  In 2005, there was some government restructuring, and several neighboring villages became under the Takayama Municipality.  These are the villages of Shokawa, Kiyomi, Kokofu, Nyukawa, Miya, Kuguno, Asahi, Kamitakara, and Takane.  Their government offices became branches of Takayama, and Takayama's government now ran these towns, too.  Or something like that.</p><p>Despite having such a large land area, there's only 92,000 some people living here.  And only 60,000 or 70,000 people in the central Takayama city.  The outer lands of Takayama have a lot of mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods in the valleys connected by narrow winding roads.  The most distant and ill-populated of which is Takane.</p><p>Even at the time of the merge, Takane didn't even have 1000 residents.  Wikipedia says they had 780 in 2003.  But, they were still their own municipality, complete with its very own Elementary and Junior High schools.  At least they did until 2007.  2 years after the Takayama merge, with such few students, they closed those schools down.  And the school children of Takane now take a bus to the next village over, Asahi.</p><p>Over the summer, I wanted to visit Takane, and see what this forest oasis looked like, and I went with new ALT Simona who had just arrived in Japan 2 weeks prior.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" /></p><p>And this is basically it.  After driving through some thick forests, and windy mountain roads, there are a few houses, a couple of buildings, and then the forests open up a little bit, and you're greeting with the post office.  Takane is a very vertical village.  The residents shaved off a side of the one of mountains, and set up town.  There's a ryokan, city hall, the post office, several houses, rice fields, and a few apartment buildings.  But, there's really no commerce at all.  No convenience store.  Not even a grocery store.  I think there was a liquor store, though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" /></p><p>This place reminds me of LOST.</p><p>Most of the traffic through the town are logging trucks heading up river to the logging camps past the massive dams.</p><div class='title'><b>Takane JHS / <span class='ja'>高根中</span></b></div><p>Tucked away on the ends of the town were the former schools.  Takane JHS was near the center of the town.  Anyone living in town could easily walk there.  It's on the other side of the valley, and mostly visible from the town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" /></p><p>Most of the school was abandoned and no longer cared for.  The foot lockers in the entrance way were all torn up.  And the inside of the gym was dirty and probably hadn't been visited in over a year.  Out back was the incinerator, and changing rooms which had plenty of rust and wood damage.</p><p>Though, right next to the gym was a "gate ball" arena, so the elderly people in town were still coming up here on a regular basis.  (Gate ball is very similar to croquet)</p><div class='title'><b>Takane ES / <span class='ja'>高根小</span></b></div><p>On the way into and out of town is Takane ES.  Unlike the Junior High, this building still showed plenty signs of use.  Looking in the windows, we could clearly see that the Home Ec. room was completely clean and well kept.  The village probably still holds cooking classes for the residents.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" /></p><p>The most interesting part of the elementary school was the student entrance.  Across the 4 windows of the entrance were goodbye messages written by the students in the final year of the school.  The school's student must've been divided into 4 groups for doing activities, and cleaning, and whatever.  Each group got to write their messages on a window.</p><p>Many of the messages say <span class='ja'>いつでも</span>Happy (Always Happy), and <span class='ja'>高小サイユー</span> (Takane ES Goodbye).  It's hard to tell exactly how many students attended the school in its last year, but from counting the messages, maybe 30 or 40 students were there.</p><p>It's cute, and sad, but amazing that all these messages are still there 6 years after the fact.  A record.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Battleship Island - Gunkanjima" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gunkanjima">Battleship Island - Gunkanjima</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
