| January 17, 2026 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Kitahara and Tochihara areas of Toga valley and Otani valley are some of the first pockets of neighborhoods you encounter when traveling south and upstream along the Sho River <span class='ja'>庄川</span> in southwestern Toyama. Kitahara is on the east bank of the river, while Tochihara is on the west bank and far higher up from the river side. Both areas had flat plateaus among the sharp cliffs, forests, and tough ground, which made them sustainable enough for people to live.</p><div class='title'><b>Tochihara <span class='ja'>栃原</span></b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After climbing up the cliff from the river on the west side, the area of Tochihara was quite wide. Among all the pocket neighborhoods and settlements of Toga Valley, it was quite populous with 217 residents in 32 households nearing the 1900s. As such, it was one of the first areas in Toga to get a branch school. Tochihara Branch School <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span> was established in 1902 and stayed in use through 1973.</p><p>Tochihara became abandoned in 1976, but the area came to life again as a ski resort and farms. In the 1970s, Japan looked for open land to convert into rice farms to increase production to match their population increase. All the original homes were removed.</p><p>Today, not much remains. The ski resort closed decades ago, and its final building was bulldozed last year. Digging and land moving equipment line the areas to quarry rock for construction projects.</p><p>It should also be noted that a small settlement known as <a href="/old/v7/shimobara-winter-branch-school" title="/shimobara-winter-branch-school">Shimobara</a> sits at the foot of Tochihara's cliffs, and is directly opposite from the river of Kitahara. Perhaps ironically, it seemed an annex of Tochihara in the beginning, but these days its the only place where people still live.</p><div class='title'><b>Kitahara <span class='ja'>北原</span></b></div><p>Compared with the west bank, Kitahara on the east side has gotten more activity in recent years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Toga bridge was completed 8 years ago, and it literally bridges the Kitahara neighborhood on the east bank to the west bank. It's a huge towering structure in the middle of seeming isolation, which seems weird considering hardly anyone lives in Kitahara.</p><p>It's ultimate purpose is to lead traffic to a tunnel. The tunnel is currently under construction but when it's complete, it will bring people directly to the heart of Toga Village. Travel will be far more direct and safer in winter because of it. No idea when the tunnel will open but looking through Google Maps, construction on the bridge began nearly 13 years ago. Sometimes Japanese rural development is measured in decades.</p><p>For now, the bridge allows quick access to several hot spring hotels and guest houses.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Originally, getting to Kitahara was not easy. The main route along the Sho River is on the west bank and Kitahara was on the east. The Sho River is very wide and deep, and the river banks have never high cliffs, so people could not easily go across. To the north, the Toga River splits from the Sho River, but the cliffs were still pretty steep. The original route to Kitahara had people cross the Toga River further south, and then climb over to the mountain to reach the area.</p><p>Despite the difficulty in getting to Kitabara in olden times, many of the residents found the natural hot springs of the area incredibly soothing and relaxing. In winter especially, the hot waters helped keep everyone warm inside.</p><p>Today, there are still a few guest houses with onsens. The most impressive of these is an onsen hotel named Kitahara Sou <span class='ja'>北原荘</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hotel was established in 1985 in an effort to revitalize the area. This was a decade after most of the residents had moved away. It has over a dozen full guest rooms and some banquet halls. Seems perfect for an office weekend retreat. The hot springs are separated for men and women, and both have an indoor bath and outdoor bath. I went here on a Sunday, and the baths had several patrons, so I couldn't sneak any photos inside.</p><p>The baths were really nice, though. I sat outside in the heated bath, and could contrast between the 40 degrees of the pool and the 2 degress of the air. Unfortunately, I stayed in the pool a bit too long and started feeling dehydrated. I should've snuck in a large bottle of water.</p><p>The water felt nice, and much of the hotel felt cozy. But peeking down the halls and looking into a few rooms felt very narrow and confined. In some ways, I felt trapped. It was a weird feeling that I hadn't really felt from any of the other remote places I've visited. Are there any Yokai that make you feel this way?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I didn't explore too much on the inside (I didn't want to burst into someone's occuppied room), but I looked around the outside. Japanese architecture in the 1980s was so fun and dynamic compared to the straight lines we have in buildings today.</p><p>Further up the road, past Kitahara-so is a guest house named the Toga House <span class='ja'>利賀之家</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was currently closed, or maybe only open through reservations. Next to the Toga House was the original site of Kitahara's branch school. The Kitabara Branch School <span class='ja'>北原分校</span> was opened in 1902 with Tochihara's school, and was used through 1971. By then, there was an automobile bridge crossing Sho River, connecting the two sides, so any students living in the area could take a bus to school.</p><p>Stays in the guest house are 7500<span class='ja'>円</span>, but that includes dinner and breakfast, plus use of their onsen. Some day, I would like stay there. Although, Toga valley is full of interesting guest houses with unique histories. There's another place I would be more interested in staying.</p><p>Kitahara is a pretty remote place, but on this Sunday, there were more tourists around than I was expecting. Young folks and families stopped at the bridge to take photos. A few families stayed at Kitahara-so. And the river cruise on the Sho River was packed all day.</p><p>Even though Toga Valley and Village has been bleeding a slow death over decades, there is still a market for tourism in its beautiful nature. Maybe that Toga tunnel will bring more folks into the village center, and bring money and tourism to town.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Toga Valley 利賀谷 and Past Schools" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/toga-valley-and-past-schools">Toga Valley 利賀谷 and Past Schools</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 12, 2026 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Toga Valley is an area that cuts through the southwestern mountains of modern day Toyama prefecture. </p><p>The whole region of Toyama is known as Gokayama <span class='ja'>五箇山</span>, which was named from the region being divided into five valleys coming down from the mountains. The five valleys are Akao Valley <span class='ja'>赤尾谷</span>, Kaminashi Valley <span class='ja'>上梨谷</span>, Shimonashi Valley <span class='ja'>下梨谷</span>, Otani Valley <span class='ja'>小谷</span>, and Toga Valley <span class='ja'>利賀谷</span>. I talked about the history of Shimonashi Valley little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">post about Hosoo Pass</a>.</p><p>Four of the five valleys follow the Sho River, which comes from the east side of Mt. Haku going directly north into the Sea of Japan. Toga Valley is different because it follows two different rivers. The Toga River comes from further east to join the Sho River at the base of the mountain. It also follows Momose River, which is further east and never joins either. As such, Toga Valley is almost completely cut out from the other four valleys and is far less populous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the river's edge meets the land, the forests begin. The whole area is over 95% deep forest. But, dotted along the cliffsides were several pocketed settlements back in the day with larger clusters up the mountain forming small villages of Toga, Sakagami, and Momosegawa. In 1896, the gun-district system was established which classified the entire Toga Valley as a single municipality, Higashi Tonami-gun Toga Village <span class='ja'>東礪波郡利賀村</span>. The entirety of Toga Village covered 176 square km.</p><p>As its peak in 1947, the overall population of Toga Village was 4663. (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>) Today, it's around 400. It suffered the fastest rate of population decrease in Toyama prefecture in 2010 (-23% in 5 years), and it is one of the most depopulated areas in Japan. Because of that, there are a lot of abandoned buildings, including entire areas which no longer exist today. Last year (summer 2025), I visited the area 4 times because I was interested in the area's old schools.</p><div class='title'><b>History of Toga Schools</b></div><p>The first school built in Toga Village was <b>Shimo-Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>下利賀尋常小学校</span> in 1892. This was 6 years after the Japanese government's executive order of primary education in Japan <span class='ja'>小学校令</span>, which ultimately stated that all children were required to attend and graduate 4 years of elementary school. With Toga Village established in 1896, the school was renamed to <b>Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀尋常小学校</span>.</p><p>Toga's biggest problem was distance. Toga village began where the <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> branched from <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span>. Toga River travels over 40km up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam, which forms a lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. But, Toga Village also included around 10km along Sho River and the 20km stretch of the <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east to its source.</p><p>Every 2-5 kilometers along the rivers was a small settlement. 2km doesn't seem all that far today, but in 1900, there were no paved roads or cars. (Cars only debuted in Japan in 1898!) People in the mountains traveled by foot (or rarely by horse). It was impossible for young students in the distant settlements to make the daily trip to school. This trip was even more impossible in winter when snow falls and blizzards cut off settlements completely from each other. (Not to mention the dangers of wildlife and insect attacks.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" /></a></p><p>To solve the distance education problem, branch schools <span class='ja'>分校</span> were established. These were schools that branched from the main schools to treat students who lived in areas too far or too inconvenient away. They still operated under the jurisdiction of the main school but had their own branch principal and another teacher or two depending on how many students they had. Teachers couldn't be expected to make the daily trip to school either, so they lived in the school in their own living quarters.</p><p>In 1902, the first branch schools were established in <b>Tochihara</b> <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span>, <b>Kitabara</b> <span class='ja'>北原分校</span>, <b>Sennohara</b> <span class='ja'>仙野原分校</span>, and <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>. These were all areas near the base of the mountain. It wasn't for another 30 to 35 years before more branch schools would open to treat students who lived on the top of the mountain with <b>Mizunashi</b> <span class='ja'>水無分校</span> and <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>大勘場分校</span> branch schools, and another 6 winter branch schools would open for students who lived in between. I don't have all the data, so I think other branch schools opened in this time, too.</p><p>Ultimately, these were some of the most reglected areas in Japan for education. They didn't get money to build enough schools to reach all children. Most teachers also considered being stationed in these branch schools as punishment, too, because they'd be completely cut off from their own families. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After World War II, education was restructured. All students were now required to attend 9 years of school. There was 6 years of elementary and 3 years of junior high schools. As the country rebuilt itself, it identified these remote schools as a problem and implemented the Remote Area Education Promotion Act (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95"><span class='ja'>へき地教育振興法</span></a>). More branch schools would be built in remote areas to obtain a near 100% attendance rate for schools. And, each remote branch school would now be given a grade (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A"><span class='ja'>へき地等級</span></a>). The Remote Grade ranged from 1 to 5 and is determined based on the distance from transportation, hospitals, post offices, and grocery stores. It's also determined by the distance from the main school, city center, and board of education. When a teacher is posted at a branch school, their salary would be increased based on the Remote Grade of the school.</p><p>From the educational restructuring in 1947, <b>Toga Junior High School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀中学校</span> would open in the heart of Toga Village. The graduating class was only 17 students. In 1948, branch schools for the junior high opened in <b>Sakagami</b> <span class='ja'>坂上分校</span> and <b>Momosegawa</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川分校</span>. The graduating class grew to 51 students. In 1949, more branch schools opened in <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>奥大勘場分校</span>, <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>, and <b>Shogawa</b> <span class='ja'>庄川分校</span>. The graduating class was now 92 students. Each of these junior high branch schools just used the existing branch schools, which were still used for elementary school students.</p><p>Population in Japan soured in the 1950s from 83.4 million people in 1950 and 93.2 million in 1960 (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population" title="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population">2</a>). However, Toyama Prefecture remained mostly stagnant going from 1 million people in 1950 to 1.03 million in 1960 (<a href="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015" title="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015">3</a>). And Toga Village had began its sharp decline from 4,663 in 1947 to 3,562 in 1950 to 3,038 in 1960 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). </p><p>Throughout the decade, more branch schools would open to cater to those who couldn't make the journey in winter. By 1959, the number of schools in Toga Village was at its peak. There were 21 total elementary schools (1 main school, 11 branch schools, 9 winter schools) (<a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">4</a>), and the 6 junior highs (1 main, 5 branch). <b>Note:</b> Through Internet researching, I could only find 17 elementary schools.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1962, the dormatory at <b>Toga Junior High School</b> was completed. All distant students now lived at school, which closed all junior high services for branch schools. More and more branch schools continued to close throughout the 60s as infrastructure was built. Roads were paved connecting all the settlements and more people owned cars so they could travel easily. They could also plow snow in winter easier which closed a significant amount of winter branch schools.</p><p>Throughout history, the people in Toga have been pretty poor. The mountains were terrible for growing rice, so most people lived off of growing beans and buying food from selling silk and gunpowder. With the country booming, many families abandoned their old homes to move into cities where they could find decent work and make a much better living. This also closed many branch schools as their neighborhoods were vacated.</p><p>This continued into the 70s. Tunnels were built between the mountains connecting each of the valleys, and expanded motorways were built, too, to make daily travel very easy. In 1970, the population of Toga Village shrank to 1,961, and by 1980, it was 1,328 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). In 1983, the graduating class of Toga Junior High School was only 9 students, the lowest to date. (There were 17 students in the class of 1984, though.)</p><p>By the 1990s, most of the branch schools had either closed or left dormant. In 1996, all remaining branch schools were officially closed and the government sold the buildings to whoever wanted them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1998, the above school was built, the <b>Toga All Persons School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀アーパス</span>. This huge building combined both Toga Elementary and Junior High together in a single building. There was also space for community classes, and had room for foreign students to study abroad from their sister city in Greece. Population of Toga was around 1,000 at this point and all students took the bus to school. Some students had an hour commute.</p><p>In 2004, there were municiple mergers across Japan and Toga Village folded into Nanto City which now covered all of Gokayama and the towns and cities creeping into the urban area of Takaoka. Population was 855 at this point. By 2015, there were only 18 total junior high students, and 16 elementary school students.</p><p>In 2024, both elementary and junior high schools combined into a single school called <b>Nanto City Toga School</b> <span class='ja'>南砺市立利賀学舎</span>. At the time, there were only 10 junior high students (among 3 grades) and 13 elementary students (among 6 grades). The graduating class was only 2 students. There was only one 6th grader and zero 2nd graders.

Not many young people live out here and there's really no reason. There's lots of construction, but those companies set up temporary housing for their workers in summer. Very few of those workers actually live in Toga. Historically, the area has been poor so there's not much value in living here.</p><p>Here's a full timeline of these events: <a href="/old/v7/toga-valley-timeline" title="/toga-valley-timeline">/toga-valley-timeline</a></p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley Schools, Settlements, and Neighborhoods</b></div><p>Again, Toga Valley begins where the <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span> and <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> join at the base of the mountain. Toga Village contains the first 10km along the Sho River, but the majority of the village follows Toga River up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam Lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>.

From 1962, nearly all junior high students lived at school (especially in winter) in order to completely centralize secondary education. Over the years, as more and more roads were built only the most distant students had to live at school. By the 1980s, I don't think the dorms were used. There were only 9 graduates in 1983, anyways.

They also have a yearly Photo Rogaining event!</p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley</b></div><p>Overall, I find the area of Toga Valley fascinating. Its an area that seems like people have always struggled with money, food, and population. Only the areas of Momosegawa seemed fertile enough for large rice production, but there were so many other small pockets along the valley that continued to survive. Again, I'm not really sure why people lived so far up the mountain when there wasn't anything there.</p><p>Most settlements, villages, towns, and cities were built and grew from being on the way to the next big village, town, or city. Or people settled in an area that was abundant in some resource. Maybe the settlers of Toga valley were looking for riches in the mountain, but never found any. Or maybe they just wanted to get away and stay away from the rest of Toyama. Either way, once Japan modernized after World War II, families recognized there was no value and left.</p><p>Looking back at the population chart (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>), Toga Valley had a steady population of around 3000 until its spike and peak in World War II. That spike (4,663 people) is a little misleading as it wasn't natural population growth. During World War II, large Japanese cities were routinely fire bombed by the US, and Toyama City was the most devastated in Japan. The US even used it as practice for Hiroshima and Nagasaki launching 4 "pumpkin bombs" that destroyed 99% of the city on August 1st, 1945.</p><p>Many people moved their families into the mountains to avoid these bombings and this created a population spike in rural Japan. After the war and Japan was rebuilding, there were so many new jobs available in the cities, and neighborhoods were being rebuilt. There was no reason to live in the mountains anymore, and it was probably even sabotage if you stayed.</p><p>Even so, the old guard continues to hold their old homes in the mountain valley with seemingly no real hope for the future. Maybe once the tunnel opens it'll bring more people to Toga, and they could focus on more camping and leisure outdoor activities, like mountaineering and river fishing. I don't think Toga will ever fully go away when Toga Valley's nature looks so great.</p><p>All of the schools and abandoned villages I visited have been collected into singular posts. They were all linked throughout this post, but they have also been collected at this keyword: <a href="/keyword/toga" title="/keyword/toga">keyword/toga</a>. After researching everything, there are a few more new places I want to visit, and double check on a few old ones, so I expect that keyword to grow a little in the future. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane-in-2025">Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.</p><p>After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">I visited in 2013</a>, and both buildings were still standing. <a href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane">I visited again in 2015</a>, and the Junior High had been demolished.</p><p>It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp">the nearby construction sign</a>, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.</p><p>I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. </p><p>Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.</p><p>In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.</p><p>I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.</p><p>Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wind Castle Shuttered" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered">Wind Castle Shuttered</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Although, in reality, it's not really all that easy to see unless you know what you're looking for. The castle tower isn't really that tall and its aluminum shimmer blends into the sky and the trees.</p><p>It's also not all that convenient to get to from Hwy 41 either. You either go further north than is necessary, or you take a narrow windy road straight to it. Once you arrive in Sakurayama Forest Park, it's another 450 steps up the castle trail to the peak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a pretty landmark, but it seems like it has been closed for good. Even when visiting 2 years ago, a lot of the paint was chipping away, and molding holding the thick bottled glass tiles was peeling. Now, several of the glass tiles have cracked, broke open, or broke free of their mold. The metal deck also bends under the weight of my steps. It doesn't really feel safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not really sure where this extra damage came from. There were some tiles missing before, but everything still seemed safe. Perhaps the New Years earthquake of 2024 knocked a lot more of this stuff loose. There's not a lot of money to go around these days, so the city probably thought it was easier to shutter the attraction, rather than pour money into the necessary renovations.</p><p>Throughout the year, Toyama would illuminate the castle in the evening, and the controls for the illumination were inside the room on the observation deck. The leading doors were locked, but the door on the farther side had been pulled open. The wooden edge of the door has disintergrated, <a href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered" title="/wind-castle-shuttered">pulling itself away from the hinges</a>. Another door had already been boarded shut, probably having suffered the same fate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside was a phone, speaker amplifier, and a bunch of dials and do-dads.

No one is putting money into any public attractions these days, especially in rural areas. I would imagine most of that money is going into infrastrcture, repairing roads and making new tunnels. I doubt it'll ever be repaired. Also, removing it might be costly, too.</p><p>We shall see.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takanuma Branch School 高沼分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takanuma-branch-school">Takanuma Branch School 高沼分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was officially and completely closed in 1996. </p><p>This information comes from Heyaneko's reports:<br/><a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html</a><br/><a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1274" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1274">https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1274</a></p><p>And also from Haikyo Rider's tour of Toga Valley:<br/><a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html">https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html</a></p><p>The Haikyo site has an entry, too:<br/><a href="https://haikyo.info/s/13492.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/13492.html">https://haikyo.info/s/13492.html</a></p><p>The door was open in this small two-story building, so I put on my mask and went inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The main floor seemed to mostly serve as living quarters for the remote teacher. There were dilapidated living quarters under the stairs. On the opposite side was a small room that was probably used as an office. The next room seemed like a science room. Or maybe this room was used as the teacher's office? I'm not quite sure. The "science" room had a safe, phone books, and other reference materials you wouldn't really find in a classroom.</p><p>The other rooms on the main floor were bathrooms, a kitchen, and a bathing room. It's interesting how all of the glassware, plates, and other kitchen utensils were simply left when the building closed. I think it's weird how the government just abandoned its belongings. Could they not have been used elsewhere? Or, if someone bought the building to live in, maybe they bought the building with everything in it?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, there were four rooms, but only two of them had chalkboards. In my experience, remote elementary schools tend to combine 1st and 2nd grade, 3rd and 4th, and 5th and 6th together as three homerooms total. I only count 3 chalkboards in the building. Maybe that downstairs science room was converted later. Or maybe, when they built this school building, they only needed to teach 5 or fewer children, so the school split them into two homerooms.</p><p>There weren't many remnants of a school on the top floor, though. The room to the right was completely open and lined with tatami mats. The middle room had an old wooden desk with some Japanese kanji drill books. And the store room in the middle room had cases of beer and sake. The open tatami room was mostly liked used as a banquet drinking room for the remaining adults in the village.</p><p>The other room on the left had a table and some comfortable seeting. It was probably last used as a meeting room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much of the paint looked like it was rotting away and peeling on the wall. The curtains were tattered and thin, weakened from being baked in the years of hot sunlight. Floor tiles no longer adhered to the ground. Ceiling tiles also showed spots of water damage, and some hung a bit low.</p><p>Everywhere was covered in dust, dirt, and animal droppings in some spaces. But, there weren't any smells. And it wasn't overly dusty in the air. However, even though I was wearing a mask, about a week later I had a terrible cough and lost my voice for a day. Another nearby branch school was demolished due to asbestos detected throughout the building, so maybe I got poisoned? It took me nearly a month to recover. I thought I was already careful with my mask, gloves, and washing up after getting home, but maybe it wasn't enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takanuma Branch School lies on Hwy 471 connecting all the neighborhoods of Toga Valley from the main village down to Tonami and Nanto.

Every city, town, and village had their centralized schools, but in the mountains and valleys, daily travel was nowhere near as easy as it is today.</p><p>In the 5 valleys of southwestern Toyama, known as Gokayama <span class='ja'>五箇山</span>, the area was split into 3 villages. The central-most village, Taira village, had two elementary schools, Shimonashi ES and Higashi Nakae ES. Higashi Nakae Elementary School was first established back in 1873 during the Meiji restoration. </p><p>I'm not really sure what the people in these mountain valleys did for education before then. Probably nothing. Probably no need as the children would grow up into farmers like everyone else in their home and village. And even with this elementary school established, there were other more rural pocket settlements further up and down the mountain and river who couldn't attend the school, especially in winter.</p><p>After World War II, with more money given to education, the government began building many many branch schools for the centralized schools. The Sugio Branch School was one such school. The full title of the school was <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校杉尾分校</span> or Tiara Village Higashi Nakae Elementary School - Sugio Branch School. </p><p>The Sugio neighborhood was only 5 kilometers north up the river, but it was on the other side of that river and there were no bridges. If students were to join school, they would have to travel by boat. So, the government built a branch school for the few students living in Sugio.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not exactly sure when the school opened, but Sugio Branch school had its own branch school, <a href="/old/v7/donohara-winter-branch-school" title="/donohara-winter-branch-school">the Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That school was completed in 1957, so the main branch must've been completed before. Both schools operated for less than 20 years before they were closed in March 1972. The reasons for closure were a combination of further rural depopulation in Japan and advances in transportation. Paved roads, bridges, tunnels, and snow sheds now connected most areas of Gokayama allowing for smooth daily travel. Schools had busses that could pick up the dozen or so students remaining in these pocketed areas.</p><p>After its closure as a school, the Sugio Branch School continued to operate as a nature experience center. During summer, it seems like nearly all the older elementary students in the village visited the school to learn about woodworking and craftsmanship.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's crazy how many children are in this photo compared to the population of the area today. This photo doesn't have a date, but I would guess it was the late 70s or early 80s. Since then, all the branch schools in Taira had closed, and Shimonashi ES and Higashi Nakae ES combined in 1999 to form Taira ES. 5 years later, municipal mergers were enacted across Japan and all areas of Gokayama merged with Nanto City. Taira ES was combined in Kamitaira ES in 2004.</p><p>Today, I would guess that the entire student population of Kamitaira ES is about the same or less than the number of students (maybe only sixth graders?) in the above photo.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After a while, the building was designated as a community center. Now, it is derelict.</p><p>The door was opened, so I went inside and took photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2135_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2135_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2135_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2135_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2135_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, there was an open classroom with rotting tatami mats in one corner and some crafts and other equipment in another corner. Among the equipment was a PA system, some crafts, and the old signboards for the school.</p><p>Going back downstairs, underneath the staircase was a kitchen that was fully stocked with glassware, silverware, and other kitchen attire that could be used to host an enkai (drinking party). The eldery members of this now small neighborhood probably used the building to get together every year, talk about happenings, and then have a party afterward. (All organizations and communities do this in Japan.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were glasses in the drying rack, which seemed like people were still probably using the kitchen. There was a lot of firefighting equipment near the entrance, so maybe the volunteer firefighters used the sink for water after doing drills.</p><p>The kitchen is one of the oldest parts of the building. While all schools have their own kitchens, branch schools were unique in that homeroom teachers would live in the buildings. Just as weather would make it dangerous for students to travel to the main school, it would be dangerous for teachers to make the trek to the branch school each day. So, while the branch school was in use, the teacher would live there.</p><p>There was a 5-point scale used to determine the remoteness of a branch school. This grading was determined by how difficult travel would be to a grocery store, post office, and other social facilities. Each full point on the scale added a bonus factor to the teacher's salary for the time they had to live in the school.</p><p>Sugio wasn't too far away from the main village, so it was probably rated as a 2 or 3 at best.</p><p>Next to the kitchen were the bathrooms. They seemed slightly newer than the kitchen, so I think they were converted at one point. This is probably where a bath was for the teacher living here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the hall there was a really clean room.

It is one of the first villages along the Otani Valley, part of the five valleys of the area. After the village designations of the late 1800s, it became part of Toga Village, which is kinda weird, but maybe not.</p><p>The whole area of southwest Toyama is split into five major valleys. Toga Valley is the eastern-most one, with Otani Valley directly to the west. All of these valleys are very long and winding. Today, it takes about 30 minutes to reach the center of Toga Village from the valley base by car. It takes about 10 minutes from the same location to reach Shimobara going down the Otani valley.</p><p>I don't know how they expected these students to travel the distance back to the valley base and trek 3-times the distance up another valley to reach school each day.</p><p>Well, the government must've thought the same way because in 1935 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>10 they built a branch school in the center of this village, titles <b>Toga Element School - Shimobara Winter Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀小学校下原冬季分校</span>. Apparently, roads were established enough for students to make the trip outside of winter. When the school was built they were 16 students. Later in 1973 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>48, it became an all-year branch school before closing in 1986 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>61.</p><p>This was according to research done by <a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html">Heyaneko</a>. Much like other school buildings in the distant old villages of Toga Valley, some people began living in the building for a time. But, the building had been completely vacant for about 20 years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, it's gone.

Hachiman Shrines are dedicated to the Shinto god Hachiman. He is apparently a god of archery and war, so he was a favorite god of many samurai. Many farmers and fisherman also pray to Hachiman for a bountiful harvest or a bountiful amount of fish in their nets.</p><p>This shrine was a bit unique as the Shishi Lion statues out front looked very stunted compared to ones I've seen at other shrines. Maybe these statues were the original ones from hundreds of years ago, never refreshed or reformed.</p><p>The shrine itself was protected by a wall of plexiglass surrounding the entire building. The front could be opened to enter, pray, and give your offering.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This small pocket of civilization seems pretty representative of the many villages that dot these valleys. People often refer to them as islands because of how isolated they can be. Shimobara is pretty representative of this as the walls of the valley are so steep there's really nothing around except for the next pocket village down the road 10 minutes or back up the road for 10 minutes.</p><p>It's obviously easy to travel to all these village today with the roads and tunnels carved out of the mountains. But these roads have only been established since after the war in the 60s and 70s. 100 years ago, people were probably only traveling to these villages by boat.</p><p>People still live in Shimobara today. There were four homes, and had their cars parked nearby. With the concrete school building gone, the area feels like its gotten closer to nature again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-oshiba-settlement">Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 29, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Oshiba Village or Oshiba Settlement was one of the smaller villages in Toga Valley. It was small enough and close enough to another village that I don't think anyone considered in an actual village. Thus, it was given the designation of shuraku <span class='ja'>集落</span> instead of mura <span class='ja'>村</span>. </p><p>At its height, it seems like there were 10 homes clustered together with 100 people liviing there. This was during the Meiji period. In the year 2000, no one was registered as living here. Japanese Blogger Akirango visited <a href="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121" title="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121">the area in 2020</a>, and did a lot of research on the old village.</p><p>When he visited in 2020, there were apparently several homes in the area. Most of them had been completely abandoned and several had collapsed or were on the brink of collapsing. He noted that one home looked like some folks still returned every now and then to check on it. <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html">Mr. Murakage</a> also visited the village in 2011. His page shows the population of the village since 1872 (Meiji 5).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, anyone who still owned land in Oshiba must've died or sold it to the government because the construction companies have moved in and begun cutting down the forest surrounding the village. Google Maps doesn't show any of this, but it's using satellite images from May 2024. So all this deforestation happened last summer or this summer.</p><p>Also, looking on Google Map, the road leading to the village has had some changes in the last year, too. The village road branches off from Route 471 leading to the center of Toga Village. Near the crossing, the road had been taken out by a landslide, and construction crews have been building a new support bridge going from the main road down to the village area.</p><p>So, maybe they started cutting down trees last year, and the road was taken out over winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the most important construction related projects in the area is the Toga Dam. Apparently, they've been working on this dam for almost 20 years. Looking looking at various old posts of people exploring the villages and schools in the area, looking through Google Maps, and also going there, it seems they area is full of construction from summer to fall.</p><p>Open areas have temporary dorms set up for workers. The road-side stop <span class='ja'>道の駅</span> further north on 471 had several billboards targetted at workers. It says how to avoid heatstroke while working in summer, and how it's okay to stop working if you feel too hot. The occasional truck or marked cars are parked along Route 471, too.</p><p>It seems like they could be clearing the forest for something related to the dam.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While all the homes seemed to have been removed, the Shinmei Shrine <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> was still there, left untouched for now. Shinmei Shrines are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture was important.</p><p>In his post, Akirango wondered what the shrine would say about the history of its village, both the rise and the fall. I don't think anyone would have considered Oshiba a vibrant village. But even so, I suppose the shrine would have gotten lonely with its residents slowly moving away.</p><p>The nearby <a href="/old/v7/kitamamedani-branch-school" title="/kitamamedani-branch-school">Kitamamedani Branch School</a> used to have a winter branch school in Oshiba. It's full title was Toga Elementary Kitamamedani Branch School - Oshiba Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校北豆谷分校押場冬季分校</span>. It opened in 1930 (Showa 2) and closed in 1968 (Showa 43), which is also when the Kitamamedani branch school closed. In 1943, it apparently had 11 students.</p><p>Would the shrine feel sad that children were no longer around? Or happy that they've found a more lucrative life elsewhere? Would the shrine feel sad that the remains of the town had been removed? Or happy that the area had become lively again with activity?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The outside of the shrine looked like it was pretty well intact. However, the inside didn't look so great. Much of the walls showed signs of termites. Ceiling boards looked like they were peeling and melting away. With absolutely no one in the area now returning, the shrine doesn't seem like it's going to survive many more winters.</p><p>The was a painting of Nagoya Castle on the wall. There were also samurai horse paintings on the wall facing outwards. These are pretty similar to <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">Ema Paintings</a> in Hida. By facing outwards, the luck and protection is extended to the people and happenings outside of the building.</p><p>Eventually (probably in the not so distant future), the shrine will be gone and very little trace of the Oshiba settlement will remain. Only the photos and stories of those who've been here.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamimomose-branch-school">Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The single road in town follows the river up into the mountains, going around Mt. Kongodo <span class='ja'>金剛堂山</span>, and coming into Miyagawa, Gifu, on the other side.</p><p>The current neighborhood on Kamimomose seems pretty vibrant enough these days, which several self-help facilities and performance arts camps. Many of the homes look pretty modern and maintained.</p><p>Up until a few years ago, the building of the former branch school was still standing in town. This was the Toga Elementary Kamimomose Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校上百瀬分校</span>. Like many of the other branch schools in the area, it was probably still in use until 1996, and then closed for good.</p><p>The building still stood for 25 years, but no one maintained it, so it began falling apart and became a health hazard because of asbestos. Looking through Google Maps and Google Earth, it was demolished sometime between November 2021 and October 2023.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the gymansium still stands, but it has been completely gutted.

Now with the building gone, it has become the perfect open garage to store their larger equipment.</p><p>After the main building was demolished, it seems like they repaired and reenforced the roof. The old Google Maps show it is red. But, today, it's a reflective black surface. Sometimes it looks blue because of the sky's reflection.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/urban-exploration/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
