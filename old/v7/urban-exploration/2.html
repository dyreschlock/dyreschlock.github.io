It is located in the Toga valley deep into the mountains continuing along the thinner and thinner Toga River. It is 12km away from the heart of Toga Village, which doesn't seem too far by today's standards, but 80 years ago in the depth of winter, you could only travel there by foot.</p><p>It was first opened in 1935 to 15 students who lived in the Taikanba neighborhood. The full title was <span class='ja'>利賀村立坂上小学校大勘場分校</span> or Toga Village Sakagami Elementary School Taikanba Branch School. In 1976, when Sakagami ES merged with Toga ES, it was renamed to <span class='ja'>利賀小学校奥大勘場分校</span> or Toga Elementary School Oku-Taikanba Branch School. At this time, the Taikanba neighborhood had grown to 35 students living in 8 households. (I'm not sure how that works.) With advancements in infrastructure, automobiles, and a further depopulation of the area, the branch school was closed in 1996.</p><p>The school was designated as a Grade 4 Remote School, nearly Grade 5, the highest rank. These ranks are given based on distances away from grocery stores, post offices, and general daily amenities. While travel was impossible, teachers lived in these remote schools, never leaving for weeks or possibly months at a time. Their salaries were increased by a factor based on this grade.</p><p>This information comes from Heyaneko's reports: <br/><a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html</a><br/><a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1059" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1059">https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1059</a></p><p>Haikyo Rider also did a report: <br/><a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html">https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html</a></p><p>The Haikyo site also has an entry for this place:<br/><a href="https://haikyo.info/s/15544.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/15544.html">https://haikyo.info/s/15544.html</a></p><p>I visited in early summer 2025. These guys visited in 2014 and 2017. The Haikyo site went there in 2021.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's interesting looking at the differences between my photos and theirs. The building itself really hasn't changed. According to Heyaneko, 10 years ago, an old woman was living in this building. Apparently, it was possibly to rent these old schools as a place to live for a while. Now, she's gone and apparently a construction company uses it for storage.</p><p>The branch school acts as an entrance way to the now abandoned neighborhood of Taikanba. Going up the street behind the school leads to the neighborhood and where the homes used to be. In Heyaneko's post and the Haikyo's post, they show a home in increasing states of decay.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For me, this home had completely collapsed, crushed under the weight of each year's snowfall. I searched through the rubble a little bit and found some old TVs and magazines. Maybe the construction company used this home as a place to rest after the owners moved away or passed away.</p><p>While the area seemed largely abandoned, there was a shrine further up the road that was in pretty good condition.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the area's Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>八幡宮</span>. The area around the shrine was overgrown, but not so much that is was choking out this building. The road coming from the branch school was all cleared and open. The shrine's building was still strong. The inside was clean and maintained. Someone was still coming out here. Maybe some of the residents of the old neighborhood are still around.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The only other building still standing in the area was a small fireman's garage. The building was still sound, even though the edges of the roof had been creased and bent from years of heavy snow. The electrical wiring leading from the poles to the building had snapped, so they hung low over the road.</p><p>Looking inside the garage, there was some fire equipment, but also a motorcycle and a moped. There were a few other things not related to fire fighting, so I think some people were using the garage as general storage before they left.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unlike other abandoned villages and schools in the valleys of Gokayama, this neighborhood feels like it serves no purpose. It's not a remote stop on the way to a larger village center. There's some space out here, but there aren't any vast fields for farming. I don't think the area was really renowed for anything. It doesn't really seem like there's any reason for anyone to live out here.</p><p>I suppose the settlers must've broken away from the people in the villages further in to get away from them and try to establish something for themselves.</p><p>Either way, I think it's very difficult to imagine a life out here. Prior to the 1960s, once the snow fell in October or November, you weren't leaving until March or April. Your whole summer was spent farming the food that would eat for the year until the next harvest. The river probably didn't have an abundance of fish as villages down the river would get most of them. Hunting was probably good, but enough to sustain everyone?</p><p>Somehow they managed for the time they lived here. But, like everywhere in these mountains, once the roads connected these remotes areas to the city centers, and once television became more common, people began moving inward and abandoning their past for a better life.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1059_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I can't imagine this building being around in 10 years. The Toga government has begun demolishing many of these old schools. Once these schools start to fall apart, the asbestos gets everywhere and it becomes a real hazard. You gotta get in your photos when you can.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Miune Branch School 三嶺分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/miune-branch-school">Miune Branch School 三嶺分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

At the time of its construction, there were two major elementary schools in the municipality of Taira Village, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary. However, each one had plenty of branch schools that served as the students' actual day-to-day school. Students probably only went to the main school for the entrance ceremony and graduation.</p><p>I'm not sure when it opened, but it was closed in 1962 and all students went to Shimonashi Elementary. The branch school is located in the Kogurusu neighborhood <span class='ja'>小来栖</span> directly north of downtown Shimonashi Village where Shimonashi Elementary was located. </p><p>These days its only a 5 minute drive, so it seems somewhat frivolous to have created a school so close. However, travel in Japan prior to the 60s was not so easy. The neighborhood is a somewhat decent climb from Shimonashi, and far too dangerous for a child to make the hike in winter. The village probably didn't have busses until the 1960s, so building a small school was easier. Even in Kogurusu, neighboring houses are at a pretty steep incline, so walking to school was still a challenge.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school was featured in Toyama Prefecture's series showcasing the <a href="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=1801" title="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=1801">wooden schools</a> of the past, and the old wooden building still exists today. It has been used pretty frequently as a community center for those living in the neighborhood since its closure as a school. Inside, in the entrance, are some commerative photos taken at neighborhood events. The most recent one was from 2016 for the Kogurusu Summer Festival <span class='ja'>小来栖の夏祭り</span>. The was the most recent thing I found inside the building.</p><p>The building is pretty small with only a few rooms on the first and second floors. The first room on the first floor was an open room with some tables and some other equipment. The room further back on the ground floor was also used for storage, however the floor had been eroded away leaving the dirt exposed. Going inside, bats started flying around the ceiling, so I didn't stay inside for long. I think this may have been the living quarters.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs was a much larger open room. Half of the room had Tatami, and the other half had the equipment used for their summer festival. On the wall near the doors, were some awards. In 1990 (Heisei 2), Taira Village apparently held a competition for morning exercises among the farming community. The Hanahikara (?) group <span class='ja'>はなひからの部</span> got first place, and their award was on the wall.

Today, what remains of the village is slightly hidden behind the Taira Ski Resort and Restaurant Maple.</p><p>There are several houses in the village still standing, and some of the homes seem like they've had some recently maintenance work done of them. According to some online research done by <a href="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html" title="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html">Mr. Murakage</a>, there were people living in some homes until 1982. Although, even though it doesn't seem like anyone is living here today, the families still come back to check on the houses. He and <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123">Hayaneko</a> visited in 2011 and found no one there, and neither did I during my visit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When parking at the Taira Ski Resort, you can see the village poking through the area behind Restaurant Maple. The restaurant seems like its open every day to cater to the construction workers up in the mountains doing whatever work they do. I arrived before the opening time, and the people working at the restaurant were preparing for the day.</p><p>The road to the village loops behind the restaurant and goes up the hill. You walk past a grave and some monuments. The monuments were too withered away to fully understand them. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.webp">The grave</a> was marked as Hotouge Family <span class='ja'>朴峠家</span>. <a href="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html" title="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html">Murakage-san</a> was able to research the names of the 28 homes that used to be in the village, and he listed them on his page. The Hotouge Family apparently moved to Osaka in the 1960s.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Still standing in the main area of the village were three homes, and a few sheds and garages. The first home was owned by the Yamazaki Family <span class='ja'>山崎家</span>. The next home was owned by the Higashi Family <span class='ja'>東家</span>. The Higashi Family had <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.webp">a grave</a> behind their house, but there was no Yamazaki grave. There was a foundation for a small building behind there, too.</p><p>All the homes in the area had their windows boarded up, and occasionally some extra supports along the outsides. This was mainly to prevent any structural or internal damage happening from excessive snow and snow melt in the winter. As such, the only access to the homes were the front doors, which were all locked.</p><p>There was one more home in this small neighborhood cluster. Rather than wooden supports and protection, it was covered in aluminum siding, which was probably installed in the last 20 years. The whole home seemed like it was perfectly preserved inside its metal shell. Out back, there was a family grave, but I don't remember the name. Guessing, but it was probably for the Tsujimoto Family <span class='ja'>辻本家</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the middle of this neighborhood cluster was the village's temple. The door was open, so I went. It seemed like it was pretty well taken care of for a building that was over 100 years old.</p><p>The temple included a shrine behind the folding walls, but covering the inside walls of the temple were names and names and names of everyone who was a member of the shrine. Every little bit of upper wall space was covered in thin wooden planks, each denoting a single person's membership. The planks didn't have any dates, but according to Murakage's page, the history of the village went back further than the  Meiji period. Many of the names matched Murakage's listing of famliies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking through my photos, this white plaque was the most recent, dated Heisei 10 or 1997 <span class='ja'>平成十年吉日</span>. The title says <span class='ja'>梨谷村道場修繕工事一式</span>, which seems to translate as Nashitani Village Dojo Repair Work All Members. And then it lists 66 members, and an additional 3 executive members <span class='ja'>実行委員</span>. The 3 executive members are Nakai <span class='ja'>中井</span>, Yamazaki <span class='ja'>山崎</span>, and Arai <span class='ja'>荒井</span>. In fact, there are many planks throughout the temple (or dojo?) of the Yamazaki family. Maybe their family were the mayors of the village.</p><p>So, so far, we've seen the Yamazaki Home, Higashi Home, village Temple or Dojo, and Tsujimoto Home. Behind the Tsujimoto home were storage building that were half torn apart and perhaps a few more winters away from complete collapse. The road continued past this cluster, which revealed the Nakai Home <span class='ja'>中井家</span>  on the bend of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was a walkway going past the Nakai Home into some farm fields and a storage shed was some equipment that was probably still used 10 years ago. Next to the storage shed was the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.webp">family grave</a> for the Uji Family <span class='ja'>宇治家</span>.</p><p>This small area felt very classic country, like the Shire in Lord of the Rings.

It's important to note that all of these graves were very clean, recognizable, and had recent flowers placed on them. It would seem like these families, whether the original residents are still alive living elsewhere or their descendants, still return here after winter to maintain the houses and the graves. Actually, a whole field of grass near the Nakai home showed signs of it being mowed in the last few weeks.</p><p>Nashitani Village is abandoned in that no one lives here, but it's not so abandoned that people haven't forgotten about it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, the final home in the area, the Kuribayashi Home <span class='ja'>栗林</span>, had quite a lot of recent repair work done on the front, including a new door with its <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.webp">wrapping</a> still on.</p><p>Murakage's page again lists all the families living in the village since the Meiji period, and only 5 families were still living in Nashitani by 1982 (Showa 57). Those 5 families were Yamazaki, Higashi, Tsujimoto, Arai, and Nakai. The Arai family married into the Yamazaki family. There was also the maintained grave for the Uji family. They apparently only moved to Johana, a mere 10km away.</p><p>The Kuribayashi family, though... Murakage lists them as having moved to either Kyoto or Hokkaido in the 60s. I wonder who fixed up their home.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those 5 main homes and the temple, plus a garage and a few other storage buildings were all that I could find in the area. Apparently, there's another home further up the Nashitani river.</p><p>Murakage-san visited Nashitani with another abandoned village researcher named <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123">Hayaneko</a>. He does a lot of research on these villages by looking up old schools, specifically branch schools. Branch schools are extensions of the main school in the area that cater specifically to the residents of remote villages. It's often too far and too dangerous to have the kids travel to school each day, so a local school would be built and a teacher would live at the school during the week or sometimes for the whole winter.</p><p>Out here, the school was named Taira Village Shimonashi Elementary School - Nashitani Branch School <span class='ja'>平村立下梨小学校梨谷分校</span>. According to his research, the school was classified as a Grade 3 Remote School and had 24 students in 1959 (Showa 34). It was apparently built in 1902 (Meiji 35). According ot Wikipedia, the branch school was officially closed in 1971. Apparently it was turned into a community center after it closed, but there doesn't seem to be any trace of it left.</p><p>Any elementary students left in the area went to Shimonashi Elementary School directly after the branch school closed, which became much easier with the completion of the Nashitani Tunnel in 1973. </p><p>Later in 1999, the two elementary schools in the area, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary both closed when Taira Elementary School was established. Not much later, in 2004 during the phase of rural municipal mergers across Japan, the whole southwestern area of Toyama became Nanto City. In 2006, elementary school students now went to Kamitaira Elementary School,  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I feel like the graves and the temple are the most interesting part of this village. According to Google Maps, the name of the temple of the Nashitani Nembutsu Dojo <span class='ja'>梨谷念仏道場</span>. Apparently, Nembutsu is a specific sect of Buddhist spread a priest named Rennyo <span class='ja'>蓮如上人</span> who lived in the Gokayama mountains. He began preaching about Joho Shinshu during the Muromachi period and gained many followers in the mountains and in Nanto and Johana Towns.</p><p>During the Edo Period, he was able to build temples in many of the small mountain villages for the locals to practice the religion. The temples were apparently unique in that they were as large as a normal homes, and priests could live in them. Looking back through some names, the priest of Nashitani may have been named Anchi <span class='ja'>安地</span>.</p><p>Each one of the graves are nearly identical with the exception of the famliy's name. The top reads <span class='ja'>南無阿弥陀佛</span> or Namuamida Hotoke. Namuamida is Buddha. Hotoke, I think, means statue or monument. Maybe it doesn't mean grave after all...  But, I think these monuments were still erected to pay respects to the families of the past 200 years. Weird that I never saw the Yamazaki one.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it does feel like the many pockets of society dotted throughout the Gokayama mountains have been slowly reclaimed by nature, I'm actually surprised how much information I could find out about this one. If I did more research, I wonder if I could find out more about the people who lived here, and what their modern-age descendants might be doing.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Ueda Village 上田村" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-ueda-village">Abandoned Ueda Village 上田村</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After Ueda Village, there was nothing but the road, the trees, and the climb. Many of the residents made their living catering to these travelers, or by working as porters themselves.</p><p>At the top of the first mountain was <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, which I wrote about before. The Hosoo Pass and the area is well known for its Postal Corps, a group of housewives and local people employed by the postal service who would cross the mountain every day during winter to deliver the mail. When descending from the pass from the other side, you'd reach <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="/abandoned-nashitani-village">Nashitani Village <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span></a> and then after going over Ose Pass, you'd reach Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> and Shinonashi Village <span class='ja'>下梨村</span>.</p><p>After the war, Japan began to rebuild and became an economic icon. They invested a lot of money into infrastructure, making many of the remote areas more accessible. The Gokayama Highway became Route 304, and as transportation also became stronger, fewer and fewer people were stopping at Ueda before going up the mountain. In 1970, a new Route 304 was established, and now no one traveled through Ueda.</p><p>In 1973, the remaining residents of the Ueda Village all moved away together to the Rikyu area of Johana Town, leaving what was left of their homes to be reclaimed by the forest.</p><p>In 2009, a monument was erected in remembrance of the old village. I put a <a href="/old/v7/ueda-village-translation" title="/ueda-village-translation">transcription and translation</a> of that monument in another post, so you can view the information directly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the village with its credits listed on the back of the monument. On the larger stone monument, a town map has been enshrined. It lists 35 households from 1945 (Showa 20). From research done <a href="/pages/murakage-ueda.html" title="/pages/murakage-ueda.html">Mr. Murakage on his site</a>, Ueda village had 30 homes with 174 people in 1872. The number of homes may have peaked in 1930 with 42 homes. As mentioned above, it was 35 homes in 1945. Murakage says 22 homes in 1946. And only 8 homes in 1948.</p><p>Apparently when Murakage and Hayaneko visited the area in 2011, there were still some wooden remains of a few houses. Today, I couldn't any trace of homes other than some stone foundations and a few bridges that crossed the steam and went no where.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking at the town map again, there are a lot of side roads branching off of old Route 304. The map shows a shrine off in a direction, so I wondered if there were still any traces of that left. Usually people still attend to shrines long after the area is desserted. (Of course, I wasn't able to sight-read the monument, so I didn't know the shrine had folded and its diety moved into town.)</p><p>Across the street from the monument, it did look like there was a path leading into the forest. It was heavily overgrown, but my legs were completely wrapped up and I had my work gloves. I could power through it if the path continued to be noticeable enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tearing through vines and overgrowth wasn't that bad, and the path continued to lead to a raised clearing which must've been a foundation for a home. So, I figured that I must have been going the right way. Although, looking at the map, it was clearly not. The path to the shrine went up a bit, so I continued up, but the ground was too muddy and unstable. I stepped on the ground, and my foot sunk into a mud hole. Meh, I'm going back. It's probably better to try and run through the woods in fall after the growth has died down.</p><p>I got back in my car and continued driving south going up the mountain. Along the road were several dumping pits for concrete rubble. Further up the road was a construction site for machinery milling out parts of the mountain to create concrete and concrete blocks used for road construction and such.</p><p>The road twisted back on itself and sharply shot up the mountain to reach the current Route 304.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the top of the junction, you could look back down and see just how thick the forests were after so much rain and sun in May and June.

I had found those webpages of <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko</a> and <a href="/pages/murakage-ueda.html" title="/pages/murakage-ueda.html">Mr. Murakage</a> going to the village in 2011, but it's not marked on the map, and both reports don't actually say where it is. I had a general idea where it was, though, given the location of Hosoo Pass. And just north of Hosoo Pass was Futatsuya River following north into Johana. It had to be along there, but I didn't really have confirmation.</p><p>What I was really looking for was the first image in <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko's Post</a>.

People living in these villages were largely cut off from the main Japanese society. One of the main transportation routes was along the Sho River <span class='ja'>庄川</span>, but the river only went through mountains in the north. A whole range of mountains encircled the southern end of Johana shielding the town from the valley.</p><p>So, the old Hosoo Pass route was established in 1887 (Meiji 20). It was fairly direct ascent up the mountains, but the road twisted enough that it was smooth travel for people and easy for horses, too. This 10 kilometer route was far more convenient than the 40 kilometer detour north following the river.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Halfway through the road, at the top of Hosoo Pass, you can clearly see Johana Town and the rest of the Takaoka and Tonami area.</p><p>These days that old route is no longer used. In 1927 (Showa 2), the Yahata Road <span class='ja'>八幡道路</span> was completed. It was a paved road that went directly from Johana Town, through Hosoo Pass, and continued to the Taira and Kamitaira villages before ending in Shimonashi village on Sho River. Part of this new road was the Hosoo Pass tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the southern end of Hosoo Pass, continuing to Taira and Shimonashi villages, the old route went over Kakuma Pass <span class='ja'>鹿熊峠</span>, but in 1973, the Nashitani Tunnel <span class='ja'>梨谷トンネル</span> was completed which decommisioned that part of the route. In 1979, construction on the Gokayama Tunnel <span class='ja'>五箇山トンネル</span> began and finished in 1981. The tunnel went directly through the mountains and connected with the Nashitani Tunnel. Yahata Road going through Hosoo Pass was no longer necessary.</p><p>The road is still usable today despite the occasional fallen rocks and branches from the cliffs above. Old folks still drive along the road and clear the debris. Enough preventions have been set to prevent landslides, but eventually there could be a large enough landslide to knock out the road, rendering Hosoo Pass no longer travelable from the north.</p><div class='title'><b>Adventure</b></div><p>A few weeks ago, I traveled to Hosoo Pass. At the time, I knew nothing about the area, so I followed Google Map's suggestions, which lead me to several closed roads, taking too much time, and forcing me to return a few days later. That's the day that I went to that <a href="donohara-winter-branch-school" title="donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That branch school was along the Sho River to the north of Shimonashi village.</p><p>On my second trip, I left my house early at 6:30am and arrived at Hosoo Pass around 8am, an hour by highway and 30 minutes on mountain roads. Before exploring the rest of Hosoo Pass and Yahata Road, I took the side path next to Hosoo Tunnel to climb Hakamagoshiyama. I detailed that hike in a <a href="hakamagoshiyama" title="hakamagoshiyama">different post</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Hosoo Pass Tea House Ruins <span class='ja'>細尾峠の茶屋</span></b></div><p>Today it's no longer a spectacle, but next to Hosoo Tunnel was a two story Tea House.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now all that remains are 7 metal posts sticking out of the ground and a bunch of metal garbage behind them. Much of that metal garbage is the old aluminum roof of the building. There was also a refrigerator back there, and a few other things.</p><p>I have no idea when the tea house was built, but it apparently had no running water, nor any electricity of its own. For those people who traveled along the old route in the Meiji and early Showa periods, this had to have been used as a rest stop in the middle of the journey from Johana to Taira or Shimonashi. Later, after it closed, construction companies used it as an office and warehouse.</p><p>Looking around the Internet, I found a webpage that had a photo of the tea house in the year 2001. I copied the page and <a href="/pages/hosoo1.html" title="/pages/hosoo1.html">hosted it here</a> as a backup. You could clearly see the 7 white metal posts holding up the front of the building, but many of the windows have been broken out, and the building doesn't look very safe.</p><p>I found some other photos other sites, too. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp">Here's a photo</a> of less than half of the building remaining from around 2005, I think.

There's a 3-meter drop to the ground from the road, and the ground is angled at 45 degrees. But apparently there's a trail down there which was the old Hosoo Pass route. Google Maps doesn't mark any kind of entry, but the OSM maps had a trail. And at those coordinates, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp">I found a rope</a>.

The trail apparently hugs the road and then shoots off along the ridge of the mountain. </p><p>When there's no clear indication of a trail and you're cutting through brush, it's hard to tell if you're going the right way. I naturally followed the downward slope of the mountain, but then remembered this was not the way.

This group of people would gather all the mail for the day and physically hike up to Hosoo Pass and down to Johana. They would collect the mail at Johana, and then return to Taira Post Office. Each person carried a maximum of 18 kilograms of mail and packages. </p><p>They did this 20 kilometer round trip every day, even in winter. When the traveled the formed a line of people. Sometimes in winter, blizzards would be so strong that it was difficult for the mail carriers to see the next person in front of them. They constantly had to sound off to make sure no one was left behind.</p><p>A few years later in 1887, the old Hosoo Pass route opened which made this travel must easier and faster. Again, in 1927 the paved road, Yahata Road, was opened which made travel more convenient in summer, and now mail could be transported by trucks. But the Postal Corps still transported the mail by foot in winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1945, ths Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office was built. Now, the Postal Corps had two teams. Both teams who would leave Taira and Johana post offices at 9am and meet here. Parcels and Mail would be exchanged between both teams. And then, they'd return to their towns. This cut travel time in half, but required more workers.</p><p>In 1955, as Japan experienced significant economic growth, many temporary workers were hired to match the workload. However, by 1971, the villages of Taira, Ueda, and all the areas around Shimonashi experienced significant depopulation. The current members of the corps were aging, and young people moved away to live in larger cities. The postal corps was abolished that year.</p><p>And again, the Nashitani and Gokayama tunnels were completed in 1973 and 1981, which made the road obsolete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The brickwork and cement structure is still holding after 80 years, but all of the metalwork has rusted, and the roof of the office building has collapsed. Part of the roof still protects the signboard from the weather, though.</p><p>I took a few more pictures and then returned to the road. Out of the entrance to the Postal Exchange, the old route branches up and down the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention, but I managed to go the right way.</p><p>Moving along the ridge of the mountain, I came to the area underneath the paved road. The old route snaked along with the road until it came to that 3-meter drop off with the rope. But, I figured that I could just ascend anywhere that seemed easy enough to reach the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, this looked like a good spot. I grabbed the trees and climbed up. With each step, I grabbed the next bit of plants coming out of the ground. Often I would lose my footing and slip down, but I was able to keep advancing and pulling myself up. Inch by inch, I finally saw the outline of the road and had my exit in front of me.</p><p>I moved along the 3-meter drop off until some plants were high enough to vault me up to a guardrail pipe and then I yanked myself up onto the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I should have shimmied along the road back to the rope, but I was back to civilization, and back on easy street. I returned to my car and continued down towards Johana to meet the Gokayama Tunnel.</p><p>The road continued to snake along the edge of the mountain. Occassionally I would have to squeak my car to the side to let another car pass. Lots of people were using the road today. I'm not sure why.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Gokayama Tunnel Emergency Exit</b></div><p>Eventually around a corner of the mountain road, this structure came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At first, I had no idea what this was. A small stream was flowing over part of it, so I thought it was a hydroelectric plant, using the natural spring of the mountain for power. There was an occasional whirring sound, too, which I thought it was a turbine or some kind of internal machinery.</p><p>The northern side of the structure had plastic windows, several of which were broken. I took a look inside, and a car whizzed by! Ah... I checked the map. This was part of the Gokayama tunnel.</p><p>Back at the large square garage-looking door, one of the emergency exits was not locked, and I could go inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was about a kilometer into the 3km tunnel. The road wasn't super busy, but cars whizzed by every minute or so. Next to the emergency exit was an SOS phone. Wikipedia mentions that the Gokayama tunnel was built in two parts, so maybe this was the half point of its construction.</p><p>I took some photos, and then returned to my car. I continued to the end of Yahata Road, next to the mouth of the tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was some weird art structure nearby, but this was the end of Yahata Road.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakaide <span class='ja'>坂出</span></b></div><p>After 6 hours of hiking and driving around the old road, I went to Shimonashi for lunch. Sakaide was a small family owned restaurant in the center of Shimonashi village. They had the standard dishes of Udon, Soba, and Rice Bowls.</p><p>On the menu, I noticed that they served bear meat in their dishes, so I ordered the Bear Meat Soba, or <span class='ja'>くま肉そば</span>.</p><p>The soba was great, although soba is always great. I don't know how it stood apart from other soba I've had before. In the soba were chunks of cooked bear meat. It also wasn't really remarkable. They tasted like cuts of beef. It was good, but I think buying the mountain vegetable soba <span class='ja'>山菜そば</span> would've probably been better. Either way, it was exactly the meal I wanted for lunch. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When driving down the highways and motorways of Japan, there are so many side roads that go off along mountains or continue into forests. I have driven past hundreds of these roads and barely given a thought to where they lead.</p><p>Much like this case, they are often the original old roads that snaked around the mountain before tunnels were built. Also, these roads traveled to villages that once were and are no longer.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline of the Adventure</b></div><table>    <tr><td>6:30ish</td><td></td><td>Left Home</td></tr>    <tr><td>8:00am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Arrived at Hosoo Pass Tunnel</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591">36°26'51.0"N 136°53'48.4"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>8:25am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td><a href="/old/v7/hakamagoshiyama" title="/hakamagoshiyama">Hiking Hakamagoshiyama</a></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013">36°25'54.3"N 136°52'47.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427">36°25'56.6"N 136°52'49.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Tea House Ruins</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035">36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>(Jumping down the cliff)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997">36°26'56.2"N 136°54'01.4"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Finding the Post Office</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417">36°27'03.9"N 136°54'00.2"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:05am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Leaving the Post Office</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:15am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Climbing to the Road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224">36°26'59.7"N 136°54'03.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:25am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035">36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:50am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Highway Emergency Exit</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906">36°27'37.7"N 136°54'39.3"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Back to the Main Highway</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231">36°27'54.0"N 136°54'11.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>12:30pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sakaide <span class='ja'>坂出</span> (for lunch)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503">36°25'59.3"N 136°56'54.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It apparently closed in 1972, but it was never torn down. The building has stayed abandoned since then, and the local farmers even repurposed it for storage of their farming equipment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now, nature has completely reclaimed the wooden building with trees and vines choking the remains of the structure. The front of the building is surrounded with tall grass, difficult to move through. The entrance to the school is completely shut from vines. The back of the building has tall trees towering over it. Bamboo trees also surround the old school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From certain angles, it's hard to tell there's even a building back there. Apparently later on in summer, the plants grow so high that you can't even reach it. Right now it's only the beginning of June, and already it's a bit difficult getting to the actual building.</p><p>It's a lot easier to move around the back of the building. The tree canopy prevents any of the grass growing. But, the back reveals that the building is in much worse shape.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The south end of the roof has collapsed, probably from the weight of winter snow. As the roof collapsed, it took the second floor, staircase, and back wall with it. Much of the electrical wiring of the building is now exposed.</p><p>Looking at the wood work around the building, it seemed like the local farmers adding a bunch of bracing and other wooden beams to keep the building together. But, a lot of the wood looks like it's been chewed through by termites. Even though the nearby fields look like someone has still been using them, no one has seemed to touch this building recently at all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school building looks like it had 4 rooms. The main room in the above photo was probably the office. The room leading off to the right was mostly likely the classroom. Then, there was a store room to right in the photo above, about the size of a closet. And lastly, a staircase that went up to another room. I don't know what they would've used that for.</p><p>According to folks on the Internet, the building finished construction in 1957, and in 1959, it serviced only 8 students, the children of the people living in this small farming plateau. 10 years later in 1969, there were only 4 students. It apparently closed in 1972.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going back to the full title of this building, it's the Former Higashinakae Elementary - Sugio Branch - Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>旧東中江小学校杉尾分校渡原冬季分校</span>.</p><p>In 1999, Higashinakae Elementary School <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校</span> merged with nearby school Shimonashi Elementary School <span class='ja'>下梨小学校</span>. Both schools were part of Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> at the time, and the new school was named Taira Elementary School <span class='ja'>平小学校</span>. This school used the Shimonashi ES building, so the Higashinakae building was no longer used.</p><p>Side tangent, but in 2004, due to depopulation, Toyama (and many other prefectures at the time) restructured many of its outlying villages and municipalities into larger cities. Taira village joined the other south western villages together into Nanto City. In 2006, Taira Elementary was closed, but the building is still used every day as the administrative building for the residents. It also has the post office, a clinic, and a few stores, too.</p><p>Anyways, back in the day, many of the schools (especially elementary schools) in remote areas had branch schools. Branch schools were mainly used in winter when traveling was difficult. It was much easier for a teacher or two to travel and stay there for a week, rather than the students of the area traveling to the main school building every day.</p><p>The Sugio Branch School <span class='ja'>杉尾分校</span> was in the Sugio neighborhood area further north down the river. The Donohara neighborhood was between Sugio and Higashinakae, and apparently it was too far for those 8 students to go to either school, so the Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>渡原冬季分校</span> was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The tiny area of Donohara is a plataeu above the main road going along the river down to the main Nanto City. Getting to this small area isn't too bad with my Kei car, but I'm not quite sure how a 1950s bus could safely get up here. Maybe they used a smaller bus to navigate the narrow winding road? Or maybe the students just met the bus at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>The narrow road leading to Donohara overlooks the Owatari Bridge <span class='ja'>大渡橋</span>, which was opened in 1958, only a year after the Winter Branch School was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Obviously in summer it's pretty easy to move around, but in winter, I imagine they probably don't even plow this narrow road.</p><p>Looking through photos from just a few years ago, I think the damage to the school building is very recent. Maybe it happened this winter? I wonder how much longer until they completely remove the building. Although, it's remote enough that it'll probably stay until it becomes an actual hazard, or someone buys the land.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nikoi Kougen Resort Ruins ニコイ高原の廃墟" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nikoi-kougen-resort-ruins">Nikoi Kougen Resort Ruins ニコイ高原の廃墟</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The existing building, and only actual constructed building, was to be one part of a resort area including a gold course, ski resort, archery courses, rental villas, a hotel, boating pond, an amusement park, limestone cave viewing, and more. So many hopes and dreams that had ultimately failed before the first phase had even been completed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Let's begin with the end of World War II. During the war, many ordinary Japanese citizens moved away from large cities as Americans targetted them for bombing. The Hida region was a convenient area away from Nagoya and Gifu cities in the south and Toyama in the north. As the war ended, Japan surrended, and with the newly established government from the US, people began moving back to the cities to rebuild and find work.</p><p>This was the beginning of the rural depopulation for Hida, and the depopulation became exponential in the 60s when Japanese industry started to become a worldwide innovator, especially with TVs and cars.</p><p>The area known as Nikoi Kougen used to be a small village called Nikoi-Daira with a couple of homes and a school. The school was a branch school of Tanekura Elementary School. Tanekura is the village/neighborhood west of the area along the river in the valley. Many of these really remote areas used to be mining or logging settlements. A village would build up around the logging location, the workers would have children, and then it would be too difficult for their kids to travel during winter to get to the main school. A branch school was then set up so teachers of the nearby school could travel up the mountain, stay there for a few days, and teach the kids. I talk about this a lot in the <a href="https://theschlock.com/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools" title="https://theschlock.com/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools">Kiyomi School History</a> post.</p><p>The branch school was opened in 1952 to accomodate students. It then closed in 1962 probably because the settlement had folded. It could have folded from the logging company ceasing operations there, or because people wanted to live closer to their families, or because of increased technology, more powerful cars and trucks could go up there on their own in winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1972, a construction company from Nagoya had purchased the land as part of an initiative in Japan to stop the depopulation of rural areas. The plan was to build those amusement areas mentioned above. Construction began in 1974. The first phase was to be concluded by the end of 1975, but the company went bankrupt in summer, partly due to the cost of building this resort area.</p><p>The only building that was completed was this triangular building, the resort's restaurant. It's grand opening was planned in Nov 1972, but that didn't happen. Apparently, there's records of a pre-opening event being held there, which meant that the building had been fully completed. Next to the triangular restaurant is a concrete foundation of another building that did not advance further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Credit to most of this information goes to <a href="https://haikyo.info/s/8102.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/8102.html">haikyo.info</a>. I came across this site a few weeks ago trying to find information about another haikyo site that I visited several years ago. </p><p>After a busy couple of weeks, I finally found some time to go up there. Monday of Golden Week had the best weather, so I left my house around 7:30am. I tried visiting the prior weekend, but the roads had been blocked. I went to the <a href="/old/v7/miyagawa-archaeological-museum" title="/miyagawa-archaeological-museum">Miyagawa Archaeological Museum</a> instead, and the museum guide said that it would be fine to walk there. So, whether the roads were open or not, I had planned to walk.</p><p>Sure enough, the road was still closed. But, it was a only 3.5ish-kilometer hike on a paved surface. Easy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Only 500 meters into the hike showed that it would actually be impossible to use this road to drive there. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6190.webp">A landslide</a> had completely covered the road, taking a tree with it. Throughout the trek, several other trees had fallen on the road, blocking the path. Not difficult to walk through, but not possible with a car.</p><p>A couple of forest friends also showed up on the hike. I saw a few lizards, and I also met two mountain goats.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Japanese Serow, a treasure of the forest. They are completely harmless and are considered a symbol of life in the forest. By the mid-50s, there were apparently hunted to near extinction, and a law was passed making them illegal to hunt. Since then, their numbers have skyrocketed to the point where they are no longer threatened. Sometimes they cause some problems for farmers, though, so the law was appealed in 1979 allowed farmers to cull their numbers in certain situations.</p><p>It only took about 50 minutes to cover the 3km stretch of mountain road to reach the front gate of the resort. Going past the gate and derelict pond and fountain, the road was now more open. And appearing through the woods, was the resturant of the Nikoi-Kougen Resort.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The building still stands after all this time thanks to its steel beams, concrete foundation, and aluminum (I assume) roofing. Many buildings from around this time has a similar metal roofing, and depending on the amount of snow in winter, the weight could bend and warp the roof, like what has happened with this restaurant.</p><p>The restaurant is in an odd orientation. The entrance faces towards north in the direction of the road, but the road never meets it. The road and restaurant are separated by a stream cutting through the area. The road goes past the restaurant and a small bridge connects the road to the back of the restaurant.</p><p>I'm not sure how patrons were supposed to access the entrance of the restaurant. Maybe there were supposed to be more bridges and walking paths along the opposite side of the river.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p> The triangle side of the building was meant to be fully glassed, giving everyone an open view of the nature outside. Now, all that glass is gone, and this half of the building is completely exposed. This area was one of many dining areas.</p><p>The above photo is the dining area pushed back from the entrance. Maybe it could be sectioned off as a closed room for a party of guests? The door in the wall leads to the kitchen. This section also opens up in the main open area where small tables were probably set. You could look up at the second floor dining area from here.</p><p class='img'> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p> After this, I went through the collapsing archway into a tiled room in the center of the building. This must've been the kitchen. Various pipes came up from the concrete floor. Maybe these were draining pipes for sinks?  There were more pipes on the walls. Looking at the wooden hoods above those areas, those were probably gas pipes for cooking ranges and stoves.</p><p> Several tiles has broken away from the wall, but many of them were still stronger affixed to the wall. Pretty good for a 50-year-old building no one maintained.</p><p class='img'> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The door in the back leads to a hallway with a series of rooms. The hallway has a door at the end that goes outside, so this is probably how they would bring in deliveries to stock their refrigerators. There's a square room which also has a door in the back of the building. This was probably the staff room, or maybe an office. There's a staff bathroom back here, too. </p><p>There's also the boiler room for water pressure, electricty, and heat. An electric panel was present that showed all the amps powering the freezer storage room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The two other doorways of the kitchen led to another dining area. In the back of the room was a wooden frame on the floor. I was thinking that it could've been a bar, but it was probably a tatami floor. On the ground, there was several decades-old beer bottles and cans from other people exploring the ruins in years past.</p><p>The plastic tiling on the ground had split at its seams and began curling up. Other old work equipment and gear laid on the floor, decaying with the rest of the building.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's not a very big building and the only place left to explore was the second floor dining area.</p><p>When exploring ruins, you have to be careful of a lot of different things. Depending on how decayed the building is, parts of the building could collapse when you walk on it. Exposed nails, wires, and glass could cut, puncture, and result in infection. There's also the danger of inhaling asbestos, mold, or any other toxic material used in the construction of older buildings that could now be exposed from the buildings decay.</p><p>Going up to the second floor increases the likelihood of something bad happening. I could fall through the floor. Or accidentally grab something harmful to keep my balance from falling.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The upper floor was pretty small, though. And with the triangle roof gone and being completely exposed to nature, plants had begun to grow from the floor. I didn't see any roots of these plants from below, so the floor must've been pretty thick. Even so, I still stayed towards the edge of the room, next to the walls where support was the strongest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inner wall of the room had completely decayed, so you could you see the suspended roof of the kitchen, the back rooms, and other dining rooms. There was an electrical outlet on the wall, but it's wires had been cut. There was also a dumbwaiter that connected to the one below next to the kitchen. That makes sense as the staircase was too narrow for anyone to carry food.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first floor main dining area was very simliar to the second floor. With the roof gone, dirt had been blown in or carried by snow. And from that, plants had begun to grow.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The roof covering the rest of the building had been severely warped. Almost all of the wooden supports that had suspended the metal roof had become brittle, rotted away, and broken. Having to carry the weight of 50 years worth of blizzards resulting in meters and meters of snow and ice, the roof had been molded into its current melted-looking shape. Actually, many abandoned homes in the nearby village had similar looking roofs.</p><p>Even in May, there was still large piles of heavy snow turned to ice. They probably should've given the building more clearance from the hill. The windows on that side of the building were probably the first to shatter from the pressure of snow and ice. I suppose a building company from Nagoya wouldn't know that, though.</p><p>I walked through the building again, and then ventured out back.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's the office from the outside.</p><p>Around the back was a water reservoir, so the building could have clean water. There are no pipes or sewers up here in the mountains, so the whole building would've had to be self-sufficient. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6581_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On a raised platform next to the restaurant, there was the foundation of a larger building that never made it past this initial stage. I don't think its been publically stated what this was supposed to be. It's pretty small for a hotel, so maybe it was living quarters for the staff? Or maybe it was a souvenir store?</p><p>After looking around at the foundation, I had seen everything I needed to.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I left the area from the front of the building on the opposite side of the river as the road. This is where guests would have been coming and going. But there was nothing over here. The open area of the land just led to the river. Maybe they planned on making a bridge? The stream/river was a little wider than I had planned on, but a tree had fallen across, so I balanced my way across back to the road.</p><p>I left the area the same way I had arrived.</p><div class='title'><b>Nikoi Waterfall</b></div><p>There was one other feature of the Nikoi Resort that had some infrastructure. About 1km down the road, there was a waterfall with a walkway to view it from.</p><p>On the road, you could easily hear the waterfall and see its top. But finding the trailhead leading to the walkway was not so easy. It was much further down the road than you'd think. Also, there were no signs or labels. The entrance just seemed like every other curve in the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I eventually found it, though. Several beams of the railing had rusted through and collapsed. The walkway also seemed to move a little bit when I stepped on it. But, overall, it felt safe. It did not feel like it was going to collapse.</p><p>After going across a few of these walkways, the final one went across a gap that gave the perfect image of the Nikoi Waterfall.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yep, that's a waterfall.</p><p>There was a tunnel at the end of the walkway. Apparently this led to a limestone cave? Or led to something interesting along a cliff? The sign it was only 134 meters long, but I couldn't see any light in the tunnel at all. Even after going about 10 meters into the tunnel, the ceiling was getting shorter and it looked like the tunnel had collapsed. F that, I'm outta here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I took a few more waterfall photos, but I went back to the road and then back to my car. The whole hike took about 3 hours.</p><p>Along part of the road, I was able to see the hydroelectric facilities at the base of the mountain, near where I parked. But, I was not able to see any of the road when I was back at my car. I took a few photos of what looked like a corner mirror sign, but on later inspection, couldn't find it.</p><p>Overall, I'm not really sure how the development company planned on making money from the Nikoi project. It's a nice area, but way too remote for anyone remotely rich to want to come up here regularly. The company probably saw the success of other areas in Nagano and thought they could do it here. But, nope. And they went bankrupt before even getting anywhere.</p><p>Now it's just another rotting relic of Japan's rich past.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline of the Hike</b></div><table>    <tr><td>7:30ish</td><td></td><td>Left Home</td></tr>    <tr><td>8:20am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parked</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116">36°21'14.5"N 137°12'41.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>9:10am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Front Gate of Resort</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3558944,137.2239177" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3558944,137.2239177">36°21'21.3"N 137°13'26.2"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>9:15am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Building</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3534236,137.2283197" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3534236,137.2283197">36°21'12.3"N 137°13'42.0"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Left Building</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Waterfall Trail Head</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3538455,137.2179628" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3538455,137.2179628">36°21'13.9"N 137°13'04.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:35am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Nikoi Waterfall</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3532169,137.2200632" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3532169,137.2200632">36°21'11.6"N 137°13'12.3"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Left Waterfall Area</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116">36°21'14.5"N 137°12'41.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/>    <br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japan Travel Map Page" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japan-travel-map-page">Japan Travel Map Page</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I love discovering and learning about new and interesting places and their history. I have lived here for over 12 years now, but it's been almost 19 years since I first came here and became inspired to explore, take photos, and research.</p><p>Recently, I have been going through a lot of old unsorted, unprocessed photos and unfinished posts of travels. With nearly 200 posts talking about Japanese travel and locations, I wanted to see all these locations on a map. Through doing research about some locations, I found an open source JavaScript mapping library called <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and I've added a page with all these links pinned on a map.</p><p>Use the following link to view the <a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map">Japan Travel Map</a> page.</p><p class='img'><a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Travel Page is a little bit of a work-in-progress at the moment, so the styles and features may be updated or changed in the future.</p><p>I learned about Leaflet from visiting <a href="https://haikyo.info/" title="https://haikyo.info/">Haikyo.info</a>. This site is a collection of abandoned places around Japan and whether or not its possible to trespass and explore. I came across the site when trying to find information about the <a href="/old/v7/red-factory" title="/red-factory">Red Factory</a>, an old abandoned factory which was highly rated among ruins explorers. </p><p>Leaflet has been super easy to use. Going through their <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html" title="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html">Tutorials</a>, their quick start guide puts a map on a webpage almost immediately. Plotting points is incredibly simple, too, once you get the geo coordinates. It gets a little more complicated when you want to use layers to filter certain points on the map, but it was really just an extra step. You can take a look at the code, but there's not a whole lot of special things going on underneath.</p><p>By the way, the Red Factory is one post in a series of posts from 2016 when my friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit. These posts have their own <a href="/keyword/fishy-chaos" title="/keyword/fishy-chaos">keyword</a>, so you can view all 8 of the posts from there.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okunoshima Power Plant Ruins" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okunoshima-power-plant-ruins">Okunoshima Power Plant Ruins</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

On the island on Okunoshima <span class='ja'>大久野島</span>, there was a secret factory developing poison gas. Despite the Geneva Convention of 1925 banning the use of chemical weapons in war, it did not ban the development of storage of such weapons. Even so, the island was kept in complete secracy. Japan even removed the island from some of their official maps.</p><p>After the war, the facility was shut down and all research and products were destroyed. It wasn't until 1988, when the poison gas museum on the island was opened, was the island officially recognized as existing.</p><p>On the east end of the island, next to the dock for the ferry, there is the standing remains of the power plant used to power the poison gas facility.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Fishy, Chaos, and I stayed the night on <a href="/old/v7/bunny-island-okunoshima" title="/bunny-island-okunoshima">Okunoshima</a>, and toured the ruined building while waiting for the ferry.

The facility focused on developing a poison gas but it was never actually used in the war. During experimentation, bunnies were used to test the effectiveness of the gas.</p><p>After Japan surrendered in World War II, the facility was shut down, all records and products were destroyed, and the bunnies were set free on the island. Decades since, the bunnies have multiplied, and now hundreds of their descendants live on the island. Because of this, the island is often referred to as <b>Bunny Island</b>.</p><p>A hotel was builit on the island sometime in the 80s, so tourists can take a ferry from the mainland and stay overnight on the island. Fishy, Chaos, and I made this one of our key destinations during our 2016 vacation, and you can take a look at all the photos from our stay below.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Apr 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/urban-exploration/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/urban-exploration">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
