| July 31, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The other night, i simply had the itch to download and play some game on the Virtual Console.  I wanted to go back to the past and unearth an old game that i loved playing.  I wanted something with a lot of meat, that I could devote a couple hours towards and actually build something out of my time...  which pretty much eliminated all systems except for the Super Nintendo.</p><p>I perused the selections.  I had a real hankerin' to play Super Metriod, but the Virtual Console had a very surprising few games for the Super Nintendo and even less good ones to choose from.  Actraiser just happened to be at the top of the list (it was alphabetical).  Hot damn do I love this game.  So, in went $8 to virtual land.</p><div class='title'><b>Actraiser, you say..?</b></div><p>Actraiser was either a launch title or a near-launch title for the Super Nintendo here in America.  You basically play god and rid the world of evil monsters giving humanity a chance to develop and grow throughout the land.</p><p>The game is split up into 2 forms of gameplay.  On one hand, your spirit descends to earth and inhabits a Valkyrie statue which you control in side-scroller fashion killing monsters and an ending boss.  After that, on the other hand, your cherub partner floats above the surface as you direct the humans on which direction to expand their city.</p><p>Your level increases when the world reaches certain population milestones.  As the human grow and evolve, they invent tools and things, such as bridges, music, warm clothes, medicines..  You can bring these inventions to other parts of the land which desperately needs advancement.</p><div class='title'><b>Bliss</b></div><p>Actraiser is an absolute pure joy...  and part of what makes it so amazing is the wonderful soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who got his start composing music for the Ys game series.  Looking through his list of soundtracks, I think his most notable soundtrack just happens to be Actraiser.  The music is quite powerful and engaging.</p><p>Other wonderful little tidbits of Actraiser is the sense of advancement in the humans.  Once you initial expel monsters from a region, 2 humans are made and live in the main temple.  When you direct them to build their town, they start off building little tents and huts.  When they become slightly more advanced, they start building little houses out of wood and logs.  When they reach their highest advancement, their homes are quite suited to the environment they live in.  The desert region has stone houses capable of standing up against heavy winds and sands.  The more forest regions have stronger brick houses.</p><p>A lot of love went into this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Overall...</b></div><p>If you have 800 wii points to spend and are looking for a game with a little bit of action, but a lot of building.  Definitely check out Actraiser.  It is truly a gem of the past.</p><p>___</p><div class='title'><b>Elsewise...</b></div><p>After playing Actraiser, I remembered that it was published by Enix, which is now Square Enix, which has openly said that they will NOT be releasing any Virtual Console games.  Maybe they just changed their mind on Enix's properties during the 16-bit era and possibly other titles without the words Final or Fantasy in the title.</p><p>After playing this beautiful Enix title, I actually wanted to get my hands on Illusion of Gaia.  Another game developed by the same team.  I started looking some of this stuff up and Illusion of Gaia actually has several games in the series.</p><p>Apparently Illusion of Gaia is the second game of the series.  Soul Blazer is the first game of the series and appears to present a fantastic link between Actraiser and Illusion of Gaia.  I've never really heard of any of this before, so I'm quite exciting to see that Soul Blazer has the town building aspect of Actraiser, with the top-down action-rpg perspective of Illusion of Gaia.  That's fricken amazing.</p><p>I've never played Soul Blazer before, but if this comes out on Virtual Console, I will buy it that Monday.  I'm somewhat saddened that I hadn't heard of this game until now.</p><div class='title'><b>Wishlist..</b></div><p>Other games that I want to play on Virtual Console include: Illusion of Gaia (SNES), Super Metriod (SNES), Star Tropics (NES), Crusader of the Centy (Genesis), and Snatcher (Sega CD).</p><p>I'd also love to check out Terranigma, which is the sequel to Illusion of Gaia.  Unfortunately, Enix lost its company in America before they were able to bring it over, or else we would have had it.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up Zelda: A Link to the Past and Castlevania 4 at some point.  I'll probably make a stupid decision at some point and buy Super Mario Bros, as well.</p><p><em>Edit</em>: Actually, i thought of 2 others games I'd like on Virtual Console: Secret of Mana (SNES) and SD Snatcher (MSX)</p><div class='title'><b>By the way..</b></div><p>In case you're wondering, I have 3 Virtual Console games with the recent purchase of Actraiser.  My other two games are Gunstar Heroes and Sonic the Hedgehog 2<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Condemned" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/condemned">Condemned</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Condemned was one of those premiere games on the 360.  There was other more prominent first person games such as Perfect Dark Zero and Call of Duty, but Condemned was the one that really showcased the 360 graphically.  It was graphically superior to all other launch titles, had a very dark setting, and included its fair share of gore.  My roommate, Tyson, picked it up and I watched him play through the first couple chapters and it seemed like that's all this game was.  Your typical dark, gory first-person game that showcased the 360.</p><p>Today, some people still regard it as one of the 360's top 10 games.  "Is this the same game?" I thought.  "The same game that tries to be scary and edgy, but is really just a hodge-podge of sew together predictable plot devices we've seen in so movies B movies..  This game is a top 10 360 title?"  Well, it just so happens that this launch title was on clearance at Target for a mere $15.  Eh.. why the hell not.</p><p>Well, unfortunately Target didn't have any copies..  In fact, I don't think any of the Targets in Madison actually have any clearance games at all.  I remembered that Gamestop had some sort of sale back in May or June where this game was $20, so I went over there.</p><p>I remember correctly, but they, too, were out of new copies of Condemned.  They had plenty of used copies though for $25.  "What the..?  Is this right?" I asked a nearby employee.  "Yes actually.  We're out of new copies of Condemned, which we sold for $20.  However, we have plenty of used copies..  In fact..  10.. 11.. 12..  We have about 12 copies used for the low low price of $25.  It's really kind of odd.  Apparently suckers, i mean, gamers tend to buy used copies of 360 games more than new copies, so we try to keep a good stock of used games.  In fact, occasionally we open up new copies and mark them as used."</p><p>O_o..  "maybe it's because new copies of most 360 games are $60 which is entirely too high to ask your average gamer to pay for games..  why would i pay $25 for a used copy of the game, when i can buy a new copy of the game for $20?"</p><p>"well..  we're out of new copies of the game."</p><p>"ugh.. whatever, i don't really care.  I just want to give the game a chance."  For some reason, that little voice in head that calls me an idiot took a break.  I could have just rented the game for $8 at blockbuster, or possibly even bought an extremely cheap copy of the game from there too.  Oh well..  my completest collector instincts took over and thought that i'd probably end up liking this game, so i probably want to own it.  (and) Gamestop used copies (which are probably new copies opened up to look like used copies) are in much better condition than a worn out Blockbuster used copy which has had countless diseased hands touching and groping it throughout the past year and a half.</p><p>Well, i suppose i am pretty glad i picked up the game because it's not all bad..  it actually has some very nice points to it, but is riddled with too many annoying things.</p><div class='title'><b>It begins..</b></div><p>You are Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent sent into investigate another serial killing in the futuristic damp dreary setting of Metro City.  The city, itself, is overrun by jacked up thugs whose only release of sweet sweet violence, which has escalated 28 percent in the last year.</p><p>In the abandoned Weisman Office Building, there has been another killing in the Match Maker case.  During the investigation, it just so happens that the killer is still in the building.  In fact, you catch him escaping to the upper floors.  You and your partner take off in opposite directions to capture him.</p><p>This is all going on during the first chapter of the game by the way, so technically these would be spoilers.  Everything in the first chapters sets the story for the rest of the game when the chapters concludes.  You corner the killer, but he over powers you.  Takes your gun.  Kills your partner and a police man.  Then throws you out the window down 4 or 5 stories into a dumpster.</p><p>Bad luck, huh?  Well the bureau happens to think the killer was never present in the building.  They pin the murders of your partner and police officer on you, and you must escape from the law, while solving the crime and catching the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>How to play..</b></div><p>Condemned is your typical first-person shooter-like game, except guns are not your primary weapon of attack.  Melee weapons you can find all over the environment are your main sources of attack.</p><p>Grip #1: You can only have one weapon at a time.</p><p>Most things you can find lying around, you can walk up to and grab using the A button.  (a little icon will appear when you can do this.)  Some weapons are better than others, which you can compare in a little tool tip box that appears in the upper right hand corner.  However, there are some weapons you need in order to progress through the level.  You need a fire-ax to chop through some wooden doors.  A crobar can pry open weapon cabinets.  A shovel can destroy panels of electrically locked doors.  And the good 'ol fashion sledgehammer will break off pad locked doors.</p><p>When you get to a point where you need one of these weapons, you need to drop whatever kickass weapon you may already have.  So i need to drop my sub-machine gun with 20 bullets, to pick up a slow-ass shovel that'll get me into a room with 4 or 5 more enemies.  This is a good idea.  I usually end up running back and picking up the weapon i had before.</p><p>Anyways..</p><p>Combat really isn't all that in-depth.  You have a block and you have an attack.  Blocking attacks give you the opportunity to land quick counter-blows.</p><p>You also have a very handy taser, which conviently stuns enemies long enough to render dead with a shovel and not even have to worry about blocking or combat in general.  Your taser takes a little while to power up though, so you cannot spam enemies with it.</p><p>I usually taser an enemy, grab their weapon from them, and kill them on the next blow with their own weapon.  Then pick up the weapon I dropped and continue on my merry fugitive way.</p><div class='title'><b>Evidence tracking and gathering..</b></div><p>Something Condemned does have going for it is finding and examining evidence.  Hell.. you are a forensics officer.  You have equipment to track blood, take blood samples, look for other clues and take photographs.  You send all this stuff back to your friend at the bureau's lab.  Luckily, she trusts that you are innocent.</p><p>Going around tracking clues is fairly linear though.  There are no side quests where you might find another murder, or solve another crime.  Everything you find builds your case proving your innocence and tracking the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>Graphics..</b></div><p>The other thing condemned actually does have going for it are the overly detailed graphics.  You can really tell that this was the #1 priority for Condemned.  It is certainly one of the prettiest games I have seen on the 360.</p><div class='title'><b>Why do people love this game?</b></div><p>Ultimately though, what really makes this game great is the creepy dark setting.  You never once see daylight in Metro City.  Everything either takes place underground with the absence of light, or outside during nightfall.  Never once does your character experience the sun.</p><p>Hmmm... come to think of it.. this is actually a pretty clever trick to make the graphics artificially feel better.  The game has an incredible amount of detail, but there's no way you could pack this detail in a wide landscape.  I don't think you ever see any more than 40 feet in front of you.</p><p>Anyways, the darkness plays trick on you.  I mean, how is walking around in the dark with a bunch of jacked-up creeps with a taste for blood NOT scary?  And they love to jump out at you when you least expect.  It really keeps you on the edge of your seat and quite entertained, much like Silent Hill or Resident Evil.</p><p>One of the best scenes of the game is the abandoned mall.  by the way, every place that you go to in Condemned is some abandoned building.  An office building, the library, a school, subway station, the mall...  It wouldn't be creepy and full of hostiles if they weren't abandoned, right?</p><p>Anyways, the mall is all decked out for Christmas, but probably last year's Christmas.. or maybe the year before.  Various presents are found across the floor.  Piles of garbage collect in the corner.  Many displays have been shattered with the Mannequins inside beginning to decay.  All the while, you can make out a faint scratchy Christmas song over the intercom to wish you a Merry Christmas.</p><p>This is the fifth chapter in the game, so you've gotten to the point where you are really into the game.  You know how to play and what to expect from the game, but this brings the whole level up a notch.  Especially when you finally come across the enemies.  I won't spoil that..</p><div class='title'><b>The story..</b></div><p>The story itself is alright, but hardly pays off.  It reminds me of Zone of the Enders 1, where this game was meant to start off a whole franchise of story-concluding properties in the future.  I suppose, Matrix 1 was the same way.  "Well crap, we have way too much story to cram into one game.  We can't possibly introduce this world, create a compelling story, and conclude everything we start in one shot.  Let's put out what we have and create the definite game of the series at a later date.  We just need to get this one out now."</p><p>There's something to be said about this style of production.  I mean, how can you cram the entire story of a world into a game and still make it suspenseful and compact?  RPGs have been doing it quite well, but developers are under the impression that the average games does NOT want to spend 40, 60, or 80 hours on a single game.  You think maybe that's because you've stereotyped gamers into ADD children that want nothing but action?</p><p>It does make for a nice compact property though.  One game here, one game there.  Two stories in the same environment.  One that introduces us to the world, and one later that tears down that world and ties up all the lose ends.</p><p>Of course, I feel sorry for the sucker that pays $60 for each game in the series.</p><p>#1 Grip: The biggest absolute worst thing about the game is it's attempt to be linear at the very end.  <em>Spoiler: when you reach the end you are presented with the choice of killing the real killer, or not killing him. </em>  Its a tough decision that the game gives you 5 seconds to make up your mind.  Don't worry though.  Whether you kill him or not, does not change the actual ending.  Stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall, though..</b></div><p>.. Condemned is semi-short game that has some unique characteristics in a very very overdone style.  Do we really need another first person game on the xbox platform?  Is this game good enough that I can say it was well worth it to even produce in the first place?</p><p>Yeah, I guess so.  It definitely has its moments.  But there are so many other better first person games out there I probably should have played first.  I still haven't played Doom 3, or Half-life 2.</p><p>I guess the real test will be the sequel coming out this fall, which was another reason why I wanted to play this game sooner rather than later.</p><p>If Condemned 2 fixes the really annoying things about Condemned 1 and fully explains why the birds were dying and puts closure on the madness that engulfs Metro City..  and its not some stupid retarded explanation..  Then I would say that playing these games isn't a waste of time.</p><p>Condemned, on its own, is okay.  If you like first person games, you'd probably like this.  If you like spooky scary games, you'd probably like this.  If you don't like either of these types of games, then you probably won't like this.</p><p>Overall, i like it..  pretty much for the same reason explained in the 'why people like this game' section of this article.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Acrobat 8.0 Pro Shared Reviews" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/acrobat-80-pro-shared-reviews">Acrobat 8.0 Pro Shared Reviews</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Shared Review method of Online Collaboration in Acrobat 8.0 Pro will setup a online repository of comments made on a PDF.  Pretty neat, huh?  This method is new in Acrobat 8.0 and works quite smooth and really isn't too difficult to setup if you have the right equipment.</p><p>Shared Reviews are best used with a webDav server, an online drive that allows both read and write access.  Think of it like a folder on your computer somewhere, except it has a URL location.  The Shared Review will write all the comments made on your PDF to this webDav server in the form of an RSS feed, so whenever a new comment is posted, the tracker system can automatically grab it and apply it everyone reviewing the PDF.</p><p>To do this, first you need a webDav server.  Once you've got one, all the setup is done in Acrobat 8.0.  PDFs must be encrypted in order to initiate any online review.  Acrobat has two main PDF encryptions: Password and Certificate.  Password is pretty much self-explanatory.  You choose a password, and then no one can read the PDF unless they know the password.  Certificate encryption is very smooth, but takes a colossal amount of setup that it's practically not worth it.</p><p>How do you encrypt a PDF with Certificate you might ask anyways?  Well, first off, a certificate encryption is encrypting a document using certificates.  These certificates are the identities of only those you want to view the PDF.  But you can only use certificates you've received from your companions.  If you don't have a certificate for Matt, then you must send out an email through Acrobat asking him for one.  When you receive a full blown certificate from your pal, he will know be one of your 'Trusted Identities' and you can add them into the encryption.</p><p>Anyways, with an encrypted document, you can use the Shared Review option.  You must setup preferences on the location of your webDav server and passwords and such.  You select how you wish to send out invitations of this review.  You select who receive email notifications about the review.  (and then) You select what you want the email message to say.</p><p>Hurrah, all done.  The email either contains a link to the PDF if you have the PDF itself saved on the webDav too, or the PDF will just be an attachment.</p><p>_____</p><p>Pretty neat, huh?  Well the point of this whole post is that I wish to automate this process so Users don't have to put up with all the convoluted steps and instructions written above.  I mean, how can you possibly go through and explain this to everyone that plans on using it.  What a mess..  I doubt anyone actually knows what the hell i'm talking about in the above paragraphs unless you've used Acrobat for online collaboration.  (aside from the fact it's not very well written either.)</p><p>So, I set forth on the internet to figure out how to make a button someone could press, or a file someone could run that would password encrypt a PDF and setup the Shared Review in the correct location and email all the right people.</p><p>Adobe has vast and extensive documentation detailing how to automate this process and automate that process.  "Write this script, Write that script."  "Here's how to make a plug-ins for Acrobat."  "This is pretty nice," i thought.  "I'll have this banged out in no time."  Yeah, not so much.</p><p>You can password encrypt a document using JavaScript, which has been 'fully' flushed out in Acrobat 8.0.  It's been so flushed out now that certain JavaScript functions have different security levels.  So you can't just run any script you want.  Password encryption just happens to fall into the category of untrustworthy.  So, in order to do this, I must write a "trusted" function that does what i want, and then call that.  Trusted functions are those that the User can manually approve of, or live in the Users script folder.  Ugh...</p><p>And, apparently, you can't automate the Shared Review.  I've come across several forum posts across the web asking how to do this, and in each case someone says that it's just not possible.  It's that great..</p><p>I sent an email to an 'expert' who said that "Initiating a shared is much more involved. check out this documents ...." which largely talked about browser-based reviews rather than shared reviews.</p><p>One thing i did find somewhat help was setting the User's preferences for using a webDav server through tinkering with the Installation process.  You can add in your preferences to the .mst file in the folder that contains the setup.exe, which I can't do since people in the office use a CD to install Acrobat.</p><p>Anyways...  i think i'm done ranting about this now..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chicago's Kwik-E Mart" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chicagos-kwik-e-mart">Chicago's Kwik-E Mart</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the release of 20th Century Fox's The Simpsons Movie, they teamed up with 11 lucky 7-Eleven stores across the US to temporary refit themselves as Kwik-E Marts.  <a href="http://www.gadling.com/2007/07/02/where-to-find-the-simpsons-themed-7-elevens/" title="http://www.gadling.com/2007/07/02/where-to-find-the-simpsons-themed-7-elevens/">Read all about it.</a> With The Simpsons Movie released this weekend, i thought it'd be a grand idea to head down to the closest one, located just south west of Chicago.</p><p>The place was a bit more crowded than I thought it would have been.  They had one of their strong-armed employees manning the door, only letting in a certain amount of people at a time.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0001.webp" /></p><p>It's rather interesting seeing so many people showing up for such an obvious marketing gimmick.  Inside housed several shelves of Simpsons merchandise and products emulating products in the Simpsons cartoon.  The most prominent of these real-life Simpsons products at this particular location were those pink dough-nuts and Squishees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0009.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0008.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0008.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0008.webp" /></p><p>The slurpee, i mean, squishee machine was actually suffering from overuse and wasn't properly chilling the contents of my sugar water.  But then had plenty of those cups to fill..  They also had mountains of those dough-nuts.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0002.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0002.webp" /></p><p>Good lord..  Apparently if you bought 25 of these dough-nuts, you'd get a free Kwik-E Mart name badge.</p><p>Unfortunately, the other real-life Simpsons products had been a little too popular.  They were completed sold out of Buzz Cola in a can.  They did have signage up on the fountain drink machine though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0005.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0005.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0005.webp" /></p><p>They only had a very sparse few boxes of Krusty-Os remaining, but in order to keep their stock, added an outragous stipulation of offering them to customers with purchases of $150 or higher.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0010.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0010.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0010.webp" /></p><p>The cashier was complaining to her co-workers about people always asking about them, but they replied, "no, we cannot make a sign about their cost..  something something.."  I'm guessing that this $150 price tag is YMMV.</p><p>The Kwik-E Mart housed plenty of plastic full sized Simpsons characters too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0007.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0007.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0007.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0006.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0006.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0006.webp" /></p><p>All in all, it was pretty fun to see so many people excited about The Simpsons.  It's somewhat ironic to see so many kids there too, who hadn't even been born when this show got its start on Tracey Ullman in 1987, and began airing on its own in 1989.</p><p>I ended up buying a squishee, a dough-nut, and a Radioactive Man comic.  no Krusty-Os or Buzz Cola :/</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0011.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0011.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0011.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I finally spent the chance to play more of Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, which came out about a month ago.  Some regard Resident Evil 4 as the best game of the last generation and I definitely agree that it's quite amazing.  With the Wii controls, better graphics than previous versions, and all the Extra bonus content, the Wii Edition proves itself as the definitive copy of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>About a month ago...</b></div><p>Man, I remember it like yesterday..  I had just moved into the new place, I made frequent posts on my blog..  That Tuesday, I stopped by Shopko looking for Resident Evil, but it was no where to be seen.  I got to my car and called a few places, all which indicated they would receive the game the next day.</p><p>After work the next day, I wasn't really in any rush.  I went out to Token Creek and played a round before stopped off at East Towne's Best Buy where I came into quite a shock.  "Hey my friend, do you guys get in Resident Evil 4 on the Wii?"  "We certainly did, consumer.  We had this entire rack over here filled up," the blue shirted employee explained as he gestured over to the now empty rack in the Wii section.  "guh!?  You guys are sold out?"  "undoubtedly"..</p><p>Crap..  I didn't take into account the popularity of this game.  It must've been advertised well.  "ummm...  well, does your West Towne store have any copies?"  A few brief moments of checking the computer revealed 3 copies remaining at the Best Buy near my house.  "Hot damn!  Thanks for the tip," as i rushed out of the store and into my car.</p><p>I guess this is what passes for adrenaline pumping, emotion driven task completion in my somewhat mundane boring life.</p><p>Thanks to the excruciating slow and dumb driving by the good people of Madison, WI, I did eventually reach the West Best Buy.  I frantically searched on the game shelves but found nothing until I checked one of the end-caps.  Huzzah..  It would seem that I have acquired the last copy at this location.  Ahhh.. that's a good feeling.</p><p>Anywho.. I spent the rest of the night playing it.  And also a good chunk of the weekend.  I beat the game once, and then proceeded through a second time earning money for the infinite rocket launcher.  I stopped at the point when I finally got it.</p><p>But as the week began, I got caught up in other things, and never really got back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Wii Gameplay</b></div><p>Resident Evil 4 is quite an amazing game and makes brilliant use of the Wii controls.  I find myself comparing this port against the other greatest game on the gamecube to receive a Wii port: Zelda - Twilight Princess.  I hated the Wii port of Twilight Princess.  The two things I absolutely hate about the Zelda Wii controls is un-precise sword controls and no camera control.  Both these are absolute non-issues for Resident Evil 4.</p><p>The Wii Controls add an amazing amount of attacking precise you use guns, rather than a sword.  Shooting a "Zombie" in the head could not be simpler.</p><p>The lack of camera is a non-issue because the game operate on a fixed camera to begin with, which lends itself perfectly for aiming and firing.</p><p>The gameplay was quite solid to begin with, but adding the extra precision of the Wii mote aiming brings it to a whole new level.  It's tough going back to FPSes on the 360 after playing Resident Evil 4.</p><div class='title'><b>Confession</b></div><p>This is the first time i've played Resident Evil 4, so it's not easy to draw the distinction between liking the game in the first place, or liking the game on the Wii.  So many people out there love Zelda on the Wii, but I think thats because they never got a chance to play the gamecube version.  When you fall in love with something, you grow loyalty towards that first initial experience and alike subsequent experiences won't measure up.</p><p>Some CAGers say they're in love with the Wii version of Resident Evil, despite playing through the Gamecube or Playstation 2 versions, but I'm not so sure I would be.  I have enough games I haven't played yet, to start playing a new version of something i had.</p><p>In that respect, I'm quite glad to have put off RE4 until now.  I'm also glad I played through Gamecube Twilight Princess before the Wii version.  Twilight Princess Wii is so gimmicky.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>I do love this game quite a bit, and as mentioned earlier, I'm not the only one.  There are several things that bug me about the actual game design that would never have me saying, "greatest game ever"..  or even "greatest resident evil ever"</p><p>The gameplay, itself, is top notch.  Maybe that's why everyone is all about this game.  Resident Evil was in serious need of a gameplay revamp.  How stupid is a game where you can't even tell what exactly you're aiming at.  This problem reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 1.  For MGS2, they added in a first person view when firing your gun.  MGS1 did have some first person views, which is easily accomplished when all of your levels are 3D.  Resident Evil held onto the pre-rendered backgrounds a little too long, and in typical Capcom fashion pumped out a good 2 or 3 sequels before thinking about what they were doing.</p><p>That's all water under the bridge now, right?  Resident Evil 4 feels like a completely new game.  So much so, in fact, it doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game.  They made an action game out of an adventure series.  They even split up the game into bite-sized level and sub-level chunks.  It's kinda like mario, you begin on stage 1-1.</p><p>Instead of finding yourself in an expansive area with some doors locked and other doors unlocked and you find keys to these doors, and solve puzzles to open others...  You find yourself on a linear path for point A to point B with very little exploration..  it's all about killing the zombies.</p><p>For a Resident Evil standpoint, it is disappointing.  You can't really take it at face value either with the number 4 in the title.  It's part of a series.  Being so, it should follow more than just the overall story, it should follow the feel as well.</p><p>Honestly, I still think the best Resident Evil is #2, with #1 as second.  Resident Evil 4 is amazing, but it's a Leon side-story.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of story...</b></div><p>Why are Resident Evil games getting more ridiculous?  Code Veronica made Claire into some kind of super hero, and the main boss was a cross-dressing psychopath.  In Resident Evil 4, Leon is also some kind of super hero was precise knife-handling skills and fast reflexes.  Does initial contact with Zombies make you that much better?  I suppose, you'd probably work out quite a bit for fear of the next impending Zombie disaster.</p><p>meh..</p><p>Part of what makes Resident Evil 1 and 2 so eerie is how down to earth you feel.  You feel like regular people trying to survive.  Regular people with guns, of course.</p><p>I hope Resident Evil 5 really brings back what it means to find yourself in a weird mysterious place in the heart of a Zombie outbreak.  An actual entire town would be fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>Segway</b></div><p>Now don't get me wrong..  if you haven't played Resident Evil 4, definitely pick it up.  It is one of best games of the last generation, and, currently, is the best game on the Wii.  You will not find a better, more affordable complement to your Wii library.</p><p>In fact, you probably won't find it because Stores have been sold out since that initial release.</p><p>Thanks to Resident Evil 4, I cannot wait for Metriod Prime ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
