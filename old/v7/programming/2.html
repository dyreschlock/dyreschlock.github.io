| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Shared Review method of Online Collaboration in Acrobat 8.0 Pro will setup a online repository of comments made on a PDF.  Pretty neat, huh?  This method is new in Acrobat 8.0 and works quite smooth and really isn't too difficult to setup if you have the right equipment.</p><p>Shared Reviews are best used with a webDav server, an online drive that allows both read and write access.  Think of it like a folder on your computer somewhere, except it has a URL location.  The Shared Review will write all the comments made on your PDF to this webDav server in the form of an RSS feed, so whenever a new comment is posted, the tracker system can automatically grab it and apply it everyone reviewing the PDF.</p><p>To do this, first you need a webDav server.  Once you've got one, all the setup is done in Acrobat 8.0.  PDFs must be encrypted in order to initiate any online review.  Acrobat has two main PDF encryptions: Password and Certificate.  Password is pretty much self-explanatory.  You choose a password, and then no one can read the PDF unless they know the password.  Certificate encryption is very smooth, but takes a colossal amount of setup that it's practically not worth it.</p><p>How do you encrypt a PDF with Certificate you might ask anyways?  Well, first off, a certificate encryption is encrypting a document using certificates.  These certificates are the identities of only those you want to view the PDF.  But you can only use certificates you've received from your companions.  If you don't have a certificate for Matt, then you must send out an email through Acrobat asking him for one.  When you receive a full blown certificate from your pal, he will know be one of your 'Trusted Identities' and you can add them into the encryption.</p><p>Anyways, with an encrypted document, you can use the Shared Review option.  You must setup preferences on the location of your webDav server and passwords and such.  You select how you wish to send out invitations of this review.  You select who receive email notifications about the review.  (and then) You select what you want the email message to say.</p><p>Hurrah, all done.  The email either contains a link to the PDF if you have the PDF itself saved on the webDav too, or the PDF will just be an attachment.</p><p>_____</p><p>Pretty neat, huh?  Well the point of this whole post is that I wish to automate this process so Users don't have to put up with all the convoluted steps and instructions written above.  I mean, how can you possibly go through and explain this to everyone that plans on using it.  What a mess..  I doubt anyone actually knows what the hell i'm talking about in the above paragraphs unless you've used Acrobat for online collaboration.  (aside from the fact it's not very well written either.)</p><p>So, I set forth on the internet to figure out how to make a button someone could press, or a file someone could run that would password encrypt a PDF and setup the Shared Review in the correct location and email all the right people.</p><p>Adobe has vast and extensive documentation detailing how to automate this process and automate that process.  "Write this script, Write that script."  "Here's how to make a plug-ins for Acrobat."  "This is pretty nice," i thought.  "I'll have this banged out in no time."  Yeah, not so much.</p><p>You can password encrypt a document using JavaScript, which has been 'fully' flushed out in Acrobat 8.0.  It's been so flushed out now that certain JavaScript functions have different security levels.  So you can't just run any script you want.  Password encryption just happens to fall into the category of untrustworthy.  So, in order to do this, I must write a "trusted" function that does what i want, and then call that.  Trusted functions are those that the User can manually approve of, or live in the Users script folder.  Ugh...</p><p>And, apparently, you can't automate the Shared Review.  I've come across several forum posts across the web asking how to do this, and in each case someone says that it's just not possible.  It's that great..</p><p>I sent an email to an 'expert' who said that "Initiating a shared is much more involved. check out this documents ...." which largely talked about browser-based reviews rather than shared reviews.</p><p>One thing i did find somewhat help was setting the User's preferences for using a webDav server through tinkering with the Installation process.  You can add in your preferences to the .mst file in the folder that contains the setup.exe, which I can't do since people in the office use a CD to install Acrobat.</p><p>Anyways...  i think i'm done ranting about this now..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wordpress + Google Reader: RSS 2.0 v.

And then Google Reader automatically fixed the problem and combined all my original ones with the newly added ones.</p><p>One little interesting thing that occurred was that I signed up for an RSS feed and Atom feed of the same blog.  "ha ha, that's funny," i thought and proceeded to leave it on there.  Mainly because Google Reader made no indication what the difference between the two were.  The particular blog in question is <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org" title="http://blog.t-kun.org">Tony's blog</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>By the way...</b></div><p>An RSS feed is blanket term to describe a simple XML representation of a blog.  Every blogging software has these things built into it these days.  Wordpress, Livejournal, Blogger, etc.. These are separate links that contain all the same data.  <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom" title="http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom">http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom</a> is the link for the Atom feed of Tony's site.  There are two main types of RSS feeds: an RSS feed and Atom feed.  Both do the same thing and pretty much all feed readers take in both, but have slight syntactical differences and standards.  RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 are the current versions.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom wikipedia</a> article goes into details on the differences between the two.</p><p>An RSS feed reader is a program that takes in all these links and checks them periodically for new articles.  That way you don't have to check 20 sites 20 times a day.  Just check your RSS reader and huzzah .. all new articles you haven't read yet brought into one source.</p><p>If you happen to be reading this post on my site rather than an RSS Feed, and you happen to be using Firefox, take a look at the address bar up top.  See that little orange symbol?  If you click it, Firefox will automatically sign you up for this RSS Feed.  It's just that easy.</p><p>Definitely check out <a href="http://reader.google.com" title="http://reader.google.com">Google's RSS Reader</a> if you haven't, for all your feed reader needs.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways...</b></div><p>After a week has gone by, I've begun to notice a little difference in the way Wordpress does its rendering of these two feeds.</p><p>First off, let's take a look at the two feeds themselves, side by side.</p><p>RSS 2.0</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" /></p><p>Atom</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" /></p><p>(These are screenshots of wordpad because Wordpress cannot display xml or code in general nicely at all... ><;; )</p><p>You can start to see the little differences, but the meat of the article is retained.  What's really weird is how Google Reader renders this particular article</p><p>Google Reader + RSS</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" /></p><p>Google Reader + Atom</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" /></p><p>Weird..  Google Reader takes the Atom at face value, rather than rendering out that ascii code as in the RSS feed.</p><p>Also, for some reason, I seem to get the Atom version an hour later than the RSS version (despite the article time being the same).  also weird..</p><div class='title'><b>uh...</b></div><p>Anyways, I don't really have an explanation for this.  I'm not sure what version of Wordpress Tony is using, but I'd guess its not Wordpress 2.2, which was released a couple of weeks ago, WHICH, I would assume actually uses Atom 1.0 rather than Atom 0.3 that Tony's Atom feed suggests.  Actually, looking at the XML, Tony is using 2.0.4.</p><p>:shrugs: I thought it was an interesting little tidbit.  I wonder if Google Reader's feed fetching of Atom 1.0 is better than 0.3.  I also wonder if Wordpress 2.2 isn't as annoying as Wordpress 2.whatever version i have.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Reflection with Generics" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/reflection-with-generics">Reflection with Generics</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Something I've been working on at Widen has been the ability to add OGNL expressions into a Tapestry Component for Lists.  I set up this whole elaborate CRUD application to add in all this data, but when it got to the Users actually entering in an OGNL expression for a specified Class..  they were somewhat baffled.  When looking at a screen with a Class name and a blank text field, how are you supposed to know which OGNL expressions you can use?</p><p>I can't expect the User to have the entire application's API memorized in their head.  So, it was no surprise that the first suggestion on my CRUD page was a list of the Class's methods.  Of course, not all the methods..  just the ones that play nice with OGNL.</p><p>Getting at these methods is dirt simple when you have the Class object of what you're working with.<br/><pre>Class object = MyClass.class;<br/>Method[] publicMethods = object.getMethods();</pre><br/>huzzah..</p><p>getMethods() will only return the methods visible to anyone.  Since private and protected methods are not accessible to just anyone, you'll only get the public methods.  Of course, this will return every single public method from every super class..  so you'll get a bunch of methods from Object and other classes that have information you don't really care about.  Use this instead:<br/><pre>Method[] publicMethods = object.getDeclaredMethods();</pre><br/>getDeclaredMethods() will only return methods declared within the Class itself (and are only visible to anyone).  But, we probably want some methods from super classes that are interesting.  Thus begins the filtering out process.<br/>______</p><p>Anyways, now that I've got my Method, I want a couple things from it: a) the Name of the Method, b) the Return Type, and c) the Declaring class.  Mostly, I want to mimic the basic method list that pops up when developing in an IDE.  Well, it just so happens the Method has all this information built in for me.<br/><pre>String methodName = method.getName();<br/>Class returnType = method.getReturnType();<br/>Class declaringClass = method.getDeclaringClass();</pre><br/>It's all pretty self explanatory until I got a new request yesterday about all this.  Some of these methods return Lists, Sets, Collections and like and when it displays this information, OGNL simply uses toString() which doesn't look pretty at all.  It usually prints out something like this:<br/><pre>[MyClass info info, MyClass info info, MyClass info info]</pre><br/>The request was to add some way of stylizing the object within a Collection, which wasn't too tough.  I added another OGNL expression value to the CRUD page and intercepted the value going into the List Component..  but now I'm back at the beginning.  Another blank text field will no idea what to put in it, and this time I don't even have the Class.  Luckily, reflection is here to save the day.</p><p>Let's say this is my class:<br/><pre>public class MyClass<br/>{<br/>...<br/>private List otherClasses = new ArrayList();<br/>...<br/>public List getOtherClasses()<br/>{<br/>return otherClasses;<br/>}<br/>}</pre><br/>and I've got my Method object of getOtherClasses.  You might be tempted to do this:<br/><pre>method.getTypeParameters()</pre><br/>which returns an Array of TypeVariables.  These are the declaring Generic types, rather than the declared types, so you'd get the letter E, rather than OtherClass, since the declaration of List looks like:<br/><pre>public class List&lt;E&gt;</pre><br/>This baffled me for a while, but it makes sense after thinking about it.  This is the return type and its properties.  On its own, it is completely independent from your Method.  After much searching around and asking for help, Method has another helpful function:<br/><pre>Type returnType = method.getGenericReturnType()</pre><br/>I was always looking for the generic type on the return type's Class rather than the Method.  As far as I can tell, this will return two different Object which extend Type: either a Class equal to the Return Type, or a ParameterizedType.  The ParameterizedType holds the owner and the generic parameters.<br/><pre>if(method.getGenericReturnType() instanceof ParameterizedTypeImpl)<br/>{<br/>for(Type type : ((ParameterizedTypeImpl) method.getGenericReturnType()).getActualTypeArguments())<br/>{<br/>genericsOfReturnType.add((Class) type);<br/>}<br/>}</pre><br/>Now my little dynamic API window on my CRUD page is complete.  I wonder if this is how javadoc compiles all of its html pages.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Questing for Bugs" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/questing-for-bugs">Questing for Bugs</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

When i don't have anything particular to work on, I'll log into our bug tracking software. This has a list of all bugs and cases that people are and aren't working on. I sort for unassigned cases, and then assign it to myself. This is pretty much like any bulletin board you'll find around anywhere, especially in an old medieval town, usually on the back wall of a tavern. "Search for a Dragon", "Provide safe passage across the Bog of Sorrow", "Fix order processing", "This image doesn't show up in IE".. ya know. Daily Quests.</p><p>Once i pick up my quest, it's time to journey into the wilderness. The dark forest which contains complex webs of Java code. I delve deeper into the darkness, running over what happened to the contractor when he was doing the same thing. Finding the problem, developing a strategy/solution, and going through with it. I'm sure i could come up with a clever analogy if i thought about it.</p><p>Success. The quest has been complete, back to town to report my success. As, i return to town, I sync up my code base to be completely current with events and things that have happened while i was away. I didn't get any emails about Build Errors, so it appears the town was safe while i was away. I reach the gates of the inner city, and run my JUnit test suite, just to make sure the results of my quest don't infect and harm my fair town.</p><p>Crap. It appears by slaying this particular dragon, I have violated this one test that says there are only 7 of these left in the world. Now that there are 6, it fails. Well... i'll just rewrite that test to indicate 6.</p><p>Success again. The tests are green, and i'm good to go. I reach the tavern inside the city and lay down my solution on the bar counter, committing these changes to the repository. The commit message indicates which Quest this dead dragon is for.</p><p>And I'm set to go. Another job well done, and time to look for a new quest. Occasionally I'll get handed down an official assignment from city officials, like a feature request or refactor.</p><p>Abstraction is key to developing any application.. though, sometimes it helps to keep things a little more grounded.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Enter the Pidgin" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/enter-the-pidgin">Enter the Pidgin</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I filled out all the fields with random characters to see if i could get with that, but no..  I went through the code to check out the validation and there are 3 things that must be true in order for a Credit Card to be valid before it even considers processing.  One of these things was just that it wasn't expired, but the other 2 dealt with the number itself.</p><p>Since i was inputting a VISA card, the number had to follow a few conventions.  It had to be either 13 or 16 digits long, and had to start with a 4.  Our processing software has a bunch of other card types as well, each with their own conventions specifying the length of the number, and the first couple digits prefixing the number.</p><p>The real interesting requirement was the number had to follow the Luhn Formula, which i later looked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">wikipedia</a>.  The Luhn Formula states that when you double every other number starting from the end up the digit sequence and then add all the digits together, their sum is divisible by 10.</p><p>So...</p><p>If you have a some random number sequence: a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6</p><p>Double every other digit starting from the back: 2(a1) a2 2(a3) a4 2(a5) a6</p><p>Add them all together:  2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6</p><p>They should be divisble by 10:  (2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6) % 10 = 0 (formula 1)</p><p>Moving some things around we'd get this formula if the number of digits are even: ( 2(a(1..n odd)) + a(2..n even) ) % 10 = 0</p><p>So....  this is how i needed to derive my fake Visa number to continue along the ordering process.  I began using the conventions defined with the card type, so that gave me this template: 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.</p><p>Since we take every other digits, let's split up the variables a little bit: 4xyx yxyx yxyx yxyx.</p><p>Plugging this number into our formula, gives us ( 2(4 + 7y) + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 8 + 14y + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 4 + 7y + 4x ) % 5 = 0 (formula 2)</p><p>That 7 is rather annoying, but we've already hit prime with the 5, so you can't really reduce it much further.  Luckily it's in a cute little formula that we could just plug in numbers to find something simple..  This is, of course, if we wanted all x to be the same and all y to be the same.  Otherwise formula 2 would be formula 1.</p><p>Anywho.. looking at formula 2 for a few seconds may give you an answer.  if y = 1 and x = 1, it succeeds.  I've got my fake Visa number 4111 1111 1111 1111, but you could go the easy route and have y = 0 and find x = 4, or x = 0 and find y = 3.</p><p>I suppose it would've been easily if i kept my number as 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.  Then i would've found ( 4 + 11x ) % 5 = 0, and found x = 1 very quickly..  or that i could use x = 6 too.</p><p>After looking into this stuff, i've realized just how insecure this whole system is. It's pretty easy to make up a fake Visa number, but taking a look at that wikipedia article, the Luhn Formula is not meant for encryption, just validation.  Just a little housekeeping, so someone doesn't screw up and type a 5 rather than a 6 and still get a valid number.  This is used for all credit card numbers too, so if you're bored why not double check your Visa number to see if its valid.</p><p>Math is everywhere ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-3">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><b>Java 6 Features</b> w/ Venkat Subranium</p><p>On this third day of christmas I started of in Venkat's Java 6 features talk, which was rather enlightening.  He talked about how Java 6 has integrated the use of scripting languages into the java language and how scripting languages can use the java libraries on their own.  You can also pull in script files into your java code, run them, and play around with the results of the run code.</p><p>Something that peeked my curiosity a little more was the next feature he talked about: instantiated an instance of the compiler and being able to compile and run new code at runtime.  That's freakin' awesome.  You could do some pretty fun AI functionality by setting up some program that would write, compile and run code all on its own.  I think about having just a simple Body class sitting on a server somewhere.  It doesn't have much... just one method that takes in a filepath.  I'll send that sucker an Arm class..  The body reads and runs that Arm class and instantly makes it its own.  Pretty handy.</p><p>Eventually if you quite giving more intelligent body parts it might be able to start writing up code for making its own limbs and the code monster keeps growing...  Then the terminator would come back through time to kill me.</p><p><b>Advanced Selenium</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>Anywho...  the next panel I went to was Selenium which was also pretty slick.  Even though we use Selenium at work, i never really knew what it was about.  I thought it was just some JavaScript testing tool...  but i guess i got that backwards.  Selenium is a testing tool written in JavaScript.  You can, or write Java code to, fill out table information representing actions taken to traverse your website.  Stuff like..  fill in User text field with 'NameString', click on login, click on this and that, buy this, logout, all the while sticking in several asserts to make sure your system is doing what you want.</p><p>This is a fantastic way to test your webframe work.  Just input all your Use cases into Selenium, hit play, and it'll return all the infractions of your Use cases for you.  Huzzah..  No need to run through everything on your own.</p><p>You could also setup Selenium to run a bunch of macros that will get your within your system quicker..</p><p><b>Expert Panel</b> @ Lunch</p><p>After lunch was the expert panel discussion, which had 8 or 9 speakers take questions from the crowd.  The question of 'how should students be taught programming basics and lore when there are so many modern day languages and tools that remove the need to explicitly know about them?' was posed.  Problems are posed when teaching students only Java as language, because then they know nothing of garbage collection and memory leaks.  Problems are posed when teaching students a loosely typed language, because then type know nothing of type casting and such.  Where do teachers begin the learning process, yet still get them up to speed with the technologies of today.</p><p>Everyone on the panel said their peace about their thoughts..  Certainly, the consensus was don't tie them down to one language and CERTAINLY don't tie them down to one platform.  No one language is infinite.  One quote from the weekend was, "Don't think of software as gold bars sitting in a vault..  Software is more like lettuce.  If you let it sit, it will degrade and rot away.. "  This is true with all technologies in this field.  You have to keep current to be a valued member of this industry or else you'll be structurally unemployed sooner than you think.</p><p>This really extends further to almost all industries..  All industries evolve..</p><p>As an addendum, they added, that that's not to say forget about the past..  You don't need to know how to write code at the byte code level, but you should definitely know how that byte level code is used.  You should know the inner workings of the constructs you are building on.  Computers aren't MAGIC..  they are technological devices built on technologies built on technologies..  If you don't know how the technologies you are using as a foundation, then you have no business building on them.</p><p>Another topic brought up during this time was open source technologies with the slogan, "get your ass out there and help out"  Open source communities are the main driver's for developing these technologies, not just creators of the technologies..  The communities are the ones that pick up the left over parts, fix bugs and clean up the code which shapes and completes the projects..  Even if you needed a selfish reason to work on something, think of the scenario of coming into a job interview and being able to say that you worked on that open source technology that that company is currently using.  Dump that on your resume.</p><p><b>Reflection</b> w/ Ted</p><p>After such stirring lunch conversation, the sessions started up again.  I attended Ted ___'s guide to reflection.  Reflection is basically making an object that is the representation of a class.  This object has all the methods and fields, but this is not an instantiation of the class itself.  With reflection you can actual get to private data and methods..  Which is handy in some instances..</p><p>This is also how annotations are utilized.  When you grab the class, you can get the annotations from that class and process that information.  huzzah.  This was a repeat of Venkat's annotation talk the previous morning.</p><p><b>10 Ways to Improve your code</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>stuff to come...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-2">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This whole conference seems to be very Jave development oriented and  showcases several brilliant developers of Java and Java-like technologies.  There is also a huge focus on thw web services side of Java development,  which makes this conference right up my own alley, as well as, Widen's alley.</p><p>It's pretty much like any convention except the people speaking are actual experts rather than amatuer fans of the product.  Case in point, the three speakers I attended today were actually developers of the framework they showcased.  David Gaery showcased JSF, Venkat Subramaniam showcased Grails, and Scott Davis showcased Atom, though Davis isn't really responsible for Atom.  It is really amazing to listen to these heavyweights of the Java community talk about their passion.</p><p>Atom certainly caught my eye today, but what i'm really shopping around for is a web framework I can use and implement for theschlock.com.</p><p>JSF was kinda fun, but it felt rather heavy duty for what I wish to accomplish.  Grails is simply amazing, but it seemed difficult to customize.</p><p>What I want to do with theschlock.com is quite simply.  I want to make it a navigatable portfolio of all my old art and other random crations i've had over the years.  An end all resource of all the crap I've done.</p><p>I want to use one of these crazy new technologies because it'll give me the experience of playing around with something new and cool, as well as demonstrate my proficency of applying said technology.</p><p>After thinking about a few things though: what I want to do is quite simply.  A ton of entries sorted by date and possibly by category.  This is easily accomplished using technologies i've been using for the past couple of years.  Hell, just build a javascript 'database' type file and have page javascript load and render all those elements and huzzah..  i've got my website.  :shrugs: I guess I could do it that way.  why make things more complicated then they have to be.</p><p>Maybe i'll just search for a technology to develop a beautiful photo navigator for all the 15,000 pictures i've taken over these last four years.</p><p>Anyways, Grails is pretty amazing.  I wouldn't mind playing around with that.  Much like its' initial model: rails, it utilizes Convention over Configuration, which means you do everything a specific way rather than write up a bunch of config files to tell he framework what the hell you are doing.  This type of framework lends itself extremely well to Agile development, since you can write code fast, rather than spending time configuring everything.</p><p>The highlight of the evening was Scott Davis' keynote speach, which confronted the question of choice...  basically.</p><p>ugh...  I'm typing this up on my phone and getting rather bored.  i'll finish this up later.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Vista work around" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/vista-work-around">Vista work around</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

However, i couldn't find the product key for Vista, so after a day or two, Vista started complaining that my copy wasn't Genuine. How dare they insult my intentions!</p><p>When such things occur, they give you 3 options. You could quit and go back to the login screen, buy a product key from Microsoft directly, or you can operate in a reduced functionality mode of Windows. If you click on the reduced functionality option, it'll open up IE 7.0, and allow you to browse the web to buy a key online, or something like that.</p><p>Well, Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer are pretty much the same piece of bread, I figured.  I typed in 'c:/' as my URL, and what d'ya know! It opened up Windows Explorer. That's pretty funny. Now, I was able to watch movies and stuff while waiting for a product key.</p><p>Hey wait a minute... If i can still open up programs in reduced functionality mode, I should also be able to... I browsed to my c:/windows/ directory, and clicked on explorer.exe.  Sure enough, it opened up a fully functions windows. Interesting.</p><p>So, if Vista complains about your copy not being genuine, just file browse to Windows and open up Windows manually.</p><p>Of course, you still have that non-minimizable and non-closable window complaining about your disingenuous copy of Windows. That scoundrel! But, you can just move that to a corner of your desktop.</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before Microsoft patches this up.</p><p>PS: I'm sure this has already been posted somewheres on the internet a thousand times by now.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/programming/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/programming">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
