Setting up games takes a bit of work, but it's overall not too difficult. I wrote about the process in another post: <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">/returning-to-the-playstation-2</a>.</p><p>In that post, I mentioned how to set up games on the file server using OPL and OPL Manager, but there's more that can be done! With games available on the backend, we want a beautiful frontend to choose our games from. This is our OPL Theme.</p><p>An OPL Theme is an overall graphical layout and presentation showing off the games available. It also pulls artwork and metadata for each game. There's a default theme, but I wanted more.</p><p>As a quick link, here's the GitHub repo with my theme, and all artwork and metadata for my games. I've uploaded my game saves for the Memcard Pro2 here, as well.<br/><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout">https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout</a></p><div class='title'><b>Theme</b></div><p>There's a sub-forum on PSX-Place where people have posted all of their themes. There are 72 posts with a couple of different variations of the themes.<br/><a href="https://www.psx-place.com/forums/themes-for-opl.229/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/forums/themes-for-opl.229/">https://www.psx-place.com/forums/themes-for-opl.229/</a></p><p>Originally, I wanted to make a theme that mirrored the Analogue Pocket's interface, but I went through a bunch of these themes to see what was available. I prefer themes that are as simple as possible, and I found one that I really liked: Jonepo's N-Glass Remix, the Blur version<br/><a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/">https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It has a nice colored backdrop and simply displays the game list, cover art, and other menu options.</p><div class='title'><b>More to Come</b></div><p><b>Note:</b> I'm still working on customizing the theme and layout.

| March 9, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the Spring of 2014, I had finally built the website I had always wanted. Using the Tapestry framework and my web development experience, I wrote a site that could host all of my blog content I had written over the years and be extensible enough to easily change and build whatever I wanted into it. </p><p>I wasn’t manually building pages anymore, like I had been when I first made my website in 2003. My blog content wasn’t orphaned on another server, like when I moved to Movable Type in 2005. And, I was no longer stuck within the constraints of someone else’s design, like when I moved to Wordpress in 2006. </p><p>With my new website, I had built everything from scratch, which gave me complete full control over everything, which gave me the freedom to do anything. It was perfect.</p><p>Almost, anyways.</p><p>Tapestry is a very powerful framework, but for my particular setup at the time, it often crashed. Tapestry ran in Java, so to deploy the site on the Internet, it needed to be run in Tomcat. Once running Tomcat would serve the pages to whomever requested them. But, every two or three days, something within Tapestry or Tomcat would cause the site to be unresponsive. To fix this, I would turn it off and turn it back on again. Not a lot of people actually visited my site, so I don’t think anyone noticed.</p><p>For almost three years, things were pretty good. Though, as usual, my posting became less frequent and I stopped visiting my site as often as before. One day, when I power cycled my website, it was gone. There was nothing on my server. Apparently, a month or two prior, my web server had failed its migration. Well, whatever. All of my code was a mirror of what I had locally. I’ll just copy everything over again and start it up. Not so. My web server had also dropped Java and Tomcat support after this migration. No word about this at all. They just deleted all of my stuff, dropped support, but still billed me every month.</p><p>I looked around a little bit for a new web server. I tried one service, but I couldn’t get the site running. I continued to look around, but Tomcat support had become expensive for some reason. Maybe demand had dropped. I had thought about using cloud servers with Google which would homogenize my Internet eco-system further, but that was also more expensive that what I wanted. Also, it took me a while to figure out how to do it, and I was getting no where.</p><p>So, the site was dead.</p><p>In the last couple of months, I have been doing a lot of programming and using GitHub thanks to the Analogue Pocket. One day I saw that someone had “hosted” their blog on Github. Looking further, you could also have your web domain point to these pages and mask itself as a real website. </p><p>Oh shit. Could I do this?</p><p>GitHub is not a webserver, so it can’t run anything on the backend. Any webpage it hosts, would have to be static. Despite my website running Tapestry, almost all of my content is static. Yes, it uses a database, and Yes, the server is generating pages. But, the result is always the same. Anything that was dynamically generated from the server, could be changed to a separate page or rewritten in Javascript.</p><p>I had often thought that if I could simply make my website a huge mess of HTML pages, then I could easily find hosting and it would absolutely never crash or be inaccessible. And GitHub was answer, because not only could it host these html pages, but it could do it for free.</p><p>It didn’t take me long to find the command line program, WGET. When run, it will crawl through a website and save everything locally. It didn’t take me long to write a <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh">terminal script</a> to save my entire website in HTML into a GitHub directory that could push back to the Github to be hosted.</p><p>There were still some broken links, dynamic links that needed to be changed, and the image gallery that needed to be re-written. A few weeks later, those were all solved. I cleaned up some old posts, and removed some problematic ones from 15+ years ago. I'm also hosting images directly from Google Drive. Now, I’ve written a few new posts to cover some topics from the last year. There are still some posts that I haven't written yet. You can see that progress <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2">on GitHub</a>. I even made a custom <a href="/errorpage" title="/errorpage">error page</a>!</p><p>I think everything is good enough to consider my website reopened. :)</p><p>I first opened theschlock.com in August of 2003, so in just a few more months, it'll be the 20-year anniversary. My life has changed considerably since then, from college, to studying abroad, to working as a software developer, to moving to Japan and working in public schools, to now working in a private school. It's interesting to be able to look back and recall my thoughts during these times.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket Platform Images" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-platform-images">Analogue Pocket Platform Images</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The most visible front-facing part of these cores is the Platform information and image. This includes how cores are sorted in the openFPGA menu, the titles of the core in the menu, and the image that appears when selected. </p><p>Some core information is slightly inconsistent with others, so I've been rewriting Platform information on my own and making new images as well. I made in initial release back in November covering some cores to make them consistent with others. But now I've finished making a complete image set that covers all currently released cores.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Arcade Images</b></div><p>For each of the Arcade core, I've tried to make an image like the original marquee for the Arcade cabinet. Usually these images are available, and it only takes 5 minutes to make the image. But, for some Arcade games, those images can be hard to find in good quality. Often too, if I do get a good image, the original artwork looks lame.</p><p>Recently, I've been recreating many of these images using key art from officially marketing at the time. I put the image on the canvas and try to make it fit. Often I need to blend things around, move the title and other things in the background for a good composition. Now, I tend to spend around an hour of two making an image.</p><p>Additionally, there are some Arcade cores that can run multiple noteworthy games since manufacturers often reused their boards for other games. Later still, some game companies made board that would specifically run multiple games. Images for those cores are different than just a simple marquee.</p><p>You can view them all here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/blob/main/image_overview_arcade.md" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/blob/main/image_overview_arcade.md">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/../image_overview_arcade.md</a></p><p>Below are some of my favorites that I spent some time on:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/xevious.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/xevious.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/xevious.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcps1.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcps1.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcps1.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/radarscope.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/radarscope.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/radarscope.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcps2.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcps2.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcps2.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtexed.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtexed.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtexed.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/tecmo.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/tecmo.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/tecmo.png" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Home Images</b></div><p>People had like my images, but some people complained that my image set wasn't complete. Thus, I created a "Home" image set to complement my Arcade images. Home would include cores for Consoles, Handhelds, and Computers. Technically, handhelds aren't specifically made for the home, but I think this monicker is pretty descriptive.</p><p>I really liked <a href="https://github.com/terminator2k2/Analogue-Pocket-Core-Art" title="https://github.com/terminator2k2/Analogue-Pocket-Core-Art">Terminator2k2</a>'s Image set which just had the logos of the systems, but I needed to do something else to distinguish my set. I got the idea when I started looking at old ads for consoles that showed off their game libraries. Also on Twitter, many people like to post a smattering or a pile of game boxes when they have a large haul from a shopping spree. I thought that I should try and do that. Games are the most important thing for any console or handheld after all. They should be displayed front and center.</p><p>I already had a bunch of box art downloaded thanks to my <a href="/old/v7/pocket-utils" title="/pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a> project, so I made a collage of them in photoshop, added some perspective, shrunk down to the correct size, and color-corrected some things to make it look alright in grayscale.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Overall, I think they turned out pretty good. I think it gives a great sense of the number of options you have available for each platform.

The MiSTer is another FPGA device that has been around much longer than the Analogue Pocket, and there are hundreds of cores that have been created. All cores available for the Analogue Pocket today are ports of these cores. Because of this, it's easy to see a roadmap for future cores to be released on the Pocket. In particular, core developers <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jotego/posts" title="https://www.patreon.com/jotego/posts">Jotego</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opengateware" title="https://github.com/opengateware">Open Gateware</a> (aka Boogerman) have a wealth of cores they plan to bring to the Pocket.</p><p>I've worked ahead quite a bit so when new cores are released, I don't have to spend that afternoon making the image. It's already done, and I can quickly make a new release of Platform Images.</p><p>Here are some images for possible future cores:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcastle.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcastle.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtcastle.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/galaxian.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/galaxian.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/galaxian.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtmx5k.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtmx5k.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/jtmx5k.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/irem_m5x.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/irem_m5x.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/irem_m5x.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/jtcps3.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/jtcps3.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/_unreleased/pics/jtcps3.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/druaga.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/druaga.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/arcade/druaga.png" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>You can view all of these images here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/tree/main/_unreleased" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/tree/main/_unreleased">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/../_unreleased</a></p><p>As these cores get released, these images are moved into their released folders, so hopefully this category will be zero someday.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock Bot" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>With the world in lockdown, late last year I decided to look into what it would take to start streaming video games on the Internet. I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer from Amazon, and after a lot of tweaks, I have my stream running pretty well through OBS and broadcasting to Twitch. I've had a small following, too, so I've made a Discord to chat with people while I'm not streaming.</p><p>You can find me on Twitch here: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock">https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock</a><br/>You can join my Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK">https://discord.gg/...</a></p><p>These days I've been playing a lot of Let's Go Eevee on stream. In each stream, I hunt for Shiny pokemon and eventually I plan on collecting all of them. In order to make my streams more engaging, I have created a Chat Bot that has various games and activities. This is <b>Schock Bot</b>.</p><p>Schlock Bot is a locally run program. When it is active, it'll connect to Twitch and Discord. It will read every message in the Twitch chat and every message in the Bot channel on Discord. If a command appears, it will respond. It is written in Java with connections to MySQL. Recently, I retro-fitted Tapestry into it, so it will also host webpages, which I use as Twitch overlays.</p><p>On Git-hub, you can view all the current functionality and how to use it. For Twitch Chat, its main function is taking bets on which Shiny Pokemon will appear next in Let's Go. Also, there's a guessing game, which will give the Chat hints on a Pokemon. The first one to guess will get points!</p><p>You can view the entire project here: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot">https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot</a></p><p>It's been really fun getting back into programming. It is really satisfying that while building this thing everything really came together. And then being able to use it immediately on stream and have real people interact with it. It's great. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Plans</b></div><p>Rock blocks are always what slows down progress and kills motivation, though. Nearly everything I've been able to think of, I've been able to put into this, but there are 2 major things I wish to add that have not been working.</p><p><b>One</b>, I want to be able to listen for Channel Points redemptions and other Twitch notifications. Apparently you do this through Web hooks, but I haven't been able to get it working. With this working, I could automate a few things in the background rather than doing it manually.</p><p><b>Two</b>, I have Schlock Bot hosting web pages, which are connected in Twitch and displayed. But, again, I'm manually turning on and off their visibility. I want to make a host of other webpages that show the most recent followers and display graphics or play sound effects. I'm having trouble getting these pages working. There would need to be some kind of Ajax thing that would listen for a prompt, and then react accordingly.</p><p>With both of these things working, viewers could redeem points and have graphics show up on my stream or have a sound effect play.  Ya know, just like all the other obnoxious streamers.  Some day, this'll happen.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion Dammit" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit">Evangelion Dammit</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 15, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>How long ago was Evangelion 1.0 released in theaters?  I think it was around July 2007, wasn't it?  Even so, it's been out for a while.  And you'd think a die hard, unapologetic Evangelion fan such as myself would have seen it by now.  But I have not.  I guess I thought I was going to have or attend some big group watching Party with friends to see the rebirth, but that never happened.  At this point, I figured that the North American Bluray release would finally be the time I'd see it.  Funimation is releasing it in November 2009.</p><p>Anyways, this weekend was the first free weekend I've had for a while now.  So far on this lazy Saturday my accomplishments include: Watching the 5 most recent episodes of Late Night w/ Jimmy Fallon and sleeping on and off for about 12 or 14 hours.  As I ran out of Jimmy Fallon episodes to watch and read Eva fans going nuts over <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65" title="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65">Asuka's name change</a>, I thought about finally watching Evangelion 1.0.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 1: Finding a torrent</b></div><p>Finding a torrent for Evangelion 1.0 wasn't too difficult.  Though, my choices of which torrent to use was varied and confusing.  I finally picked one that had a decent amount of seeders and looked like an English language version.  It took about an hour or two to download.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 2: Playing the movie</b></div><p>The file I downloaded was a Matroska (MKV) file.  One of those ridiculous video formats that Anime geeks like because you can swap out subtitle files at your whim.  I thought I had means to play MKV files, but Media Player and DivX Player informed me that this was not the case.  <a href="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html" title="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html">Matroska dot Org</a> had the answers for me.  I downloaded a copy of Media Player Classic, and the video played perfectly. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 3: Subtitles</b></div><p>The torrent was kind enough to provide only the movie file.  So, when Shinji listened to the phone recording in the first moments of the film, it was in Japanese without the aid of subtitles.  It only took about 10 minutes of searching on Google to find a subtitle file.  (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf" title="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf">http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf</a>).  I opened up Evangelion 1.0 in Media Player Classic, set the subtitle file, and prepared to watch.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 4: Correcting the Subtitle file</b></div><p>Not every video file of Evangelion 1.0 is the same.  Some are recorded from a Camcorder in the theater.  Some are directly ripped from the DVD release.  Whatever the case, my copy of Evangelion 1.0 has about 32 seconds of Company IDs at the beginning before the film actually begins, which the subtitle file doesn't take into account.  So, Subtitles start to appear 32 seconds before any dialogue is said.</p><p>The whole beauty of the MKV format is that you can make your own subtitle files.  The subtitles aren't hardcoded on the video.  You can edit them.  So, I'll just fix the subtitle file by changing every time in it.  I'd do it by hand, except there are over 1000 lines of dialogue to change.  I could write a program much faster than I could do fix by hand.  Plus, it would be much more interesting.</p><p>So, that's what I did.  Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java">github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/EvaSubtitleFixer.java</a>.  If you want to use it, feel free. ^_^  You might want to change the ORIGINAL_LOCATION to whatever your subtitle file is called.  And change OFFSET_BY_SECONDS to however many seconds your subtitle file is off.  It'll plop a file called subtitles_fixes.srt in your C directory.</p><p>I guess this'll really only work with Subtitle files of the srt format.  I'm not sure how the other subtitle formats are designed.  I just took one look at the SRT file and figured out the pattern instantly.</p><p><i>Update: I wrote that code in a web application, so you can use it right now without needing any compilers or experience or whatever.  The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a></p><div class='title'><b>Success</b></div><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MGS4 Development" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mgs4-development">MGS4 Development</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I bought something rather frivolous.  When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Relax" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/relax">Relax</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I can hear everything they do, what they're touching, what they're thinking.  They've infected my senses and ruined everything.  ugh.. I'm outta here.</p><p>The problem was that some part of the program was doing something it wasn't supposed to.  This particular class assumed that whoever used it, did so in a specific order.  The class didn't really give any clues about the correct order.  Apparently whoever uses this class is supposed to look into the class and study it completely first.  Ya know, really get to know who you're dealing with.  Only when you knew everything there it to know about the class, could you use it with the at-most efficiency.  Fixing the error is easy, but that doesn't solve the problem.  This class needs a little redirection on what it means to be "user-friendly".</p><p>Out of one world and into another.  The park was pretty nice, but overall a waste of time.  There are a thousand other things I could be doing rather than laying in the sun.  Stuff is backing up at work, I could probably do some of that.  I have two discs from Netflix I haven't watched either, I could probably do those both at once.  I just hooked up my PS2, though, so I could start playing some of those games.  So many things to do.</p><p>A little bit of refactoring brings the class back into society a new and better person.  The error is fixed and shouldn't return in the future.  A perfect little cog in the machine...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to More HSSF dumbass" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/more-hssf-dumbass">More HSSF dumbass</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A month or two ago I wrote about a Java package for writing and reading excel documents named POI+HSSF, which stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation + Horrible SpreadSheet Format. <a href="/old/v7/poihssf-using-excel-with-java" title="/poihssf-using-excel-with-java">Read all about it.</a></p><p>Today, I had to write an importer for a bunch of data in an excel sheet, so I figured I should use what I know.  Everything seemed to go find until I got to cells containing dates.  My cell I wanted to read simple said '10/11', but it was a formatted date.  Underneath, the data said 10/11/2007.</p><p>No Problem, I setup a SimpleDateFormat and treated the cell as a string.<br/><pre>public static final SimpleDateFormat DATE_FORMAT = new SimpleDateFormat("MM/dd");</p><p>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        String date = cell.getRichStringCellValue().getString();<br/><span />        return DATE_FORMAT(date);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(ParseException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Unfortunately, this threw a NumberFormatException, stating that the cell had numeric contents.  O_o?? what?  I debugged my code, and found out the numeric value of cell was 39366.0.  "Ok," I thought..  "I can see where POI may have thought it was 10/11, or 10/11/2007.. but those don't add up."</p><p>I called over a co-worker to show him this weird-ness, and one of us suddenly thought.. maybe it's number of days.  I divided the number by 365 and sure enough.. it equated to 107.8..  which is about that many years since 1900.  haha!  success!</p><p>I changed my code to work with this...<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span />        return new Date(millis);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Well, this is also incorrect..  My dates would come back with the correct day, but the year was 2077!  What the...  When using new Date(millis), the millis is the number of milliseconds from January 1st, 1970, not 1900.  So, now I need to correct for that.<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span /> <span />        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />        cal.setTimeInMillis(millis); //days since 1970<br/><span />        cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, cal.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 70); //remove 70 years diff.</p><p><span />        return cal.getTime();<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>After using Java's standard way of messing with dates, we've done it!  Correctly written a function that should have already been part of the POI+HSSF sdk.</p><p>but wait!</p><p>I started getting a couple of NumberFormatExceptions with my importation.  Apparently, a couple cells in the excel sheet ARE actual text fields and not dates.  These fields simply had a date in the month/day format..  no year.</p><p>So... now I had to account for this...<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span /> <span />        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />        cal.setTimeInMillis(millis); //days since 1970<br/><span />        cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, cal.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 70); //remove 70 years diff.</p><p><span />        return cal.getTime();<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        try<br/><span />        {<br/><span />            String date = cell.getRichStringCellValue().getString();<br/><span />            Date dates = DATE_FORMAT.parse(date);</p><p><span />            Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />            cal.setTime(dates);<br/><span />            cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2007); //assumes year is 2007<br/><span />            return cal.getTime();<br/><span />        }<br/><span />        catch(ParseException e2)<br/><span />        {<br/><span />            throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e2);<br/><span />        }<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Ok..  looks good, right?  wrong..  If the cell is empty, HSSF considers this as 0 for Numeric and "" for String values.  So, I need to add in some checks so we don't parse an empty cell as a date, which would come back as January 1st, 1900.  Also, a null check for cell, would be a good idea too.</p><p>This whole function has begun to really bulk up..  I guess that's why they don't have it in their SDK.</p><div class='title'><b>Who Cares?</b></div><p>Anyways, I thought it was rather interesting that Excel stores dates as days.  I guess that means you can't store a date/time value in a single cell then.  One cell for the date, the other cell for the time.</p><p>I find it also kinda funny that Microsoft and Java don't agree on when to start the day counter.  I swear I've seen another program or language that counts days or time starting at 1940.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to POI+HSSF: Using Excel with Java" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/poihssf-using-excel-with-java">POI+HSSF: Using Excel with Java</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Migrations" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/migrations">Migrations</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings all, today is Labor Day, which is a paid vacation day at my place of business.  So instead of going into the office I can do whatever I want.  Funny that, I ended up spending close to 6 hours both finishing up that poorly written Metroid Prime and migrating all my Movable Type journal entries to this Wordpress blog.</p><p>The main bulk of that time was cutting out the 24,000 comments from prescription drug companies, magazine, and pornographic websites.  After toying around, they were all posted on one article, so cutting them out was pretty easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Exporting Movable Type into Wordpress</b></div><p>Movable Type's exporting is quite amazing, by the way.  It dumps all the articles into a text file   They have a bizzare format, but it's still pretty readable:<br/><pre>--------<br/>AUTHOR: dyre<br/>TITLE: stuff?<br/>STATUS: Draft<br/>ALLOW COMMENTS: 0<br/>CONVERT BREAKS: __default__<br/>ALLOW PINGS: 0<br/>PRIMARY CATEGORY: daily<br/>CATEGORY: daily</p><p>DATE: 10/09/2003 08:43:39 AM<br/>-----<br/>BODY:<br/>omitted boring emotional text.<br/>-----<br/>EXTENDED BODY:</p><p>-----<br/>EXCERPT:</p><p>-----<br/>KEYWORDS:</p><p>-----</pre><br/><pre><br/>--------</pre><br/>Even though Wordpress is an annoying piece of crap, it has a convient "import from Movable Type" feature, which is very helpful.  So Importing all these old entries really only took 5 minutes.  200 more articles in 5 whole minutes..  not bad.</p><div class='title'><b>Upkeep on old stale articles</b></div><p>Despite my best judgement, I decided not to cut out content related to my life at the time, so there's plenty of school related articles talking about how lazy I can be, what classes I was attending, what homework I need to do and also several articles talking about my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>All those personal articles really tappered off when broke up with her and took a 9 or 10 month break from the internet, so around April 2004 my articles became more about the subject I was writting about and less about what I did that weekend or how I felt about the crushing stress of finishing off a semester at Platteville.  Paints an emotional picture doesn't it?</p><p>To fit all these new articles, I added a couple new categories, and also organized them into sub-groups.  I also made an <b>Opinion</b> category for all my reviews, gamelogs, and impressions about various Games, Moves, Music Events and such.</p><div class='title'><b>Still more</b></div><p>There are still plenty of articles that predate installing Movable Type that I haven't gathered up, but I could easily make a program that would convert all those entries into a Movable Type backup file, and have Wordpress import them.  Handy!</p><p>Many of these are very old reviews, but are still pretty funny..  like my Treasure Planet review, Kingdom Hearts review, and Magnolia review..  Now that I finished up Metroid, maybe that's what I'll work on.</p><div class='title'><b>Bored?</b></div><p>Well, if you're really bored, feel free to go back in time and read all those articles.  It's not like these haven't already been on the internet over at <a href="/old/v7/journal" title="/journal">theschlock.com/journal</a>, so you don't really gain anything new from reading them, unless you haven't read them.  You'd probably want to use the Search engine and category trees to your advantage to finding the better articles though.</p><p>Some of my old reviews are kinda funny at least.  especially my timely <a href="/old/v7/metriod-prime-2-impressions" title="/metriod-prime-2-impressions">Metroid Prime 2 review</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>ADVICE</b></div><p>by the way, NEVER use wordpress's entry edited for writing your blog posts.  Wordpress uses some funky CSS and Javascript to make your articles look like they do after you submit them.  BUT because of this, the text field is not longer a trackable DOM field.  SO when you submit an article, the text is immediately whisked away to the HTTP request and the field is blanked out.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means if you end up getting any browser errors, domain errors.. basically any error at all: <b><em>You lose your entire post!</em></b>  I've had this happen to me enough, that I don't even use the editor unless I'm actually edited an entry.</p><p>I use Wordpad to actually write out all my entries, and then I just copy and paste them into the editor, hit save, and then hit publish.</p><p>I'm currently using Wordpress 2.0.4, so maybe they've fixed it, but I'm not taking any chances anymore.  Especially when Firefox is somewhat buggy too and can crash at will.</p><p>Something to think about anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/programming/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
