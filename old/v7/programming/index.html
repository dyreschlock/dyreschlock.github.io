| October 13, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month, the Analogue Pocket has continued to be an absolute monster. The Sega Genesis is now available. The Nintendo Entertainment System is now available. Sega GameGear is available, too. And there have been many cores of 1980s Arcade games released, too.</p><p>It's starting to get unwieldily, so I've created a collection of programs to help me organize and process games so they can be played on the Pocket.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils</a></p><p>I've been working on this pretty solidly for the past three weeks, and I think it's finally feature finished. The GitHub repository has straight forward information of how each process is set up and what exactly each process does. But, overall…</p><p>Pocket Utils is a collection of scripts and programs that do several things, including the following: (1) Process MRA files and Create Arcade Roms, (2) Create Library Images for sorted Games, and (3) Update Platform information for cores.</p><div class='title'><b>Process MRA Files</b></div><p>The Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, or MAME, on computer standardized how to emulate arcade games. When ripping games from their original boards, each component had their own file, and everything was put together in a zip file. </p><p>FPGA emulation of arcade games doesn't like this. The chip wants direct read access to the data it wants and unzipping a file in memory is extra useless overhead. Thus, the idea of a MRA file was introduced. A MRA file contains specific instructions on how each piece of the arcade board can be assembled into a single ROM file. This file is not compressed and allow free access to all the data the FPGA wants. </p><p>A separate program is required to process these MRA files, though. I use this <a href="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c" title="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c">MRA Tool</a> found in NullObject's GitHub. When an arcade core is released for the Analogue Pocket, it'll come with MRA files to create ROMs from ZIP files of arcade components. You must get the arcade ROM zips, process the MRA file in the program giving it the zip files, and then place the generated ROM into the core's folder on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>There are lots of steps to getting this to work, and many arcade cores released for the Analogue Pocket play multiple games. Some releases come with 10 or more games. In fact, arcade systems like Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 have as many as 300 variants of their games. Doing all of this manually is not feasible.</p><p>This program solves this problem.</p><p>Put all of your MRA files in the to-be-processed directory. Run the program. It'll attempt to download any and all ZIP files required to make the arcade rom, and store them locally. If the Arcade ROM is successfully generated, it'll copy it to the correct directory on the Pocket, and also copy the MRA file to the Pocket, too.</p><p>If it can't find the ZIP files online, you can manually search for them and put them in your local store. If a ROM was already generated, it'll copy over the MRA file anyway. If the MRA file is already there, it'll copy it to a duplicate directory.</p><p>With Standard games, everything works really well and there are almost never any problems. Problems usually only come up when trying to generate bootlegs or hacks of roms. Those often require extra steps.</p><div class='title'><b>Create Library Images</b></div><p>One of the most appealing features of the Analogue Pocket is the Library feature. </p><p>Something I've never liked about using emulators is having to choose the games I want to play from a list. It's so sterile and clinical. The Super Nintendo Mini was so amazing because of its visual presentation. You had a line games presented with their box art. And you could visually choose the game you wanted to play by selecting that box art.</p><p>The Library feature of the Analogue Pocket was just that. It gave you a visual list of all your games to select from. Further still, you could organize all of your games in Playlists. This was promised in Analogue's Tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888">Analogue OS</a>.</p><p>By default, the Analogue Pocket has an internal list of game data but it doesn't have an images. Early on, you could download an image pack that gave you all the title screens for every game. But I don't want title screens. I want box arts.</p><p>It took a little while to figure out, but the Analogue Pocket uses a CRC hash of the file to reference which image is uses in the Library. If you have a correctly sized PNG file, you can run it through <a href="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter" title="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter">DerTolleEmil</a>'s Image Converter and it'll give you a BIN file. Put this bin file in the correct folder named with the CRC hash, and it'll use this image in the Library.</p><p>So, my program goes a bit further with it.</p><p>In each of the folders for Consoles and Handhelds on the Analogue Pocket, I have the ROMs that I like sorted into genre folders. My initial "CreatePocketEntries" program will collect all of these games in my database. "CreateLibraryImages" will look at every game in my database and attempt to download the box art image from <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" title="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails">LibRetro</a> on Github. With this image, my program will resize it to the correct dimensions for the Pocket, convert the PNG image to BIN, name it correctly, and copy the file to the System folder on the Pocket.</p><p>Now, when using the Library, the image matches the box art. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Update Platform Information</b></div><p>Another thing that I collect in my database is Core information.</p><p>When a user chooses a core from the openFPGA menu on the Pocket, it lists certain information about itself, such as when the console or handheld was original released, who was the manufacture, and also the name and category of the core, too. All core developers are very particular about the accurate representation of the consoles, games, and their code, so this information is usually correct, but sometime it is not to avoid copyright and trademark violations.</p><p>In the database, it's easy for me to edit this information and also collect all the information into categories. My program will rewrite all of the information in the Platforms directory with what I have in my database. </p><p>Additionally, it'll create Platform Images using agg23's <a href="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process" title="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process">Platform Image Creator</a>. Any new images that I've made and placed in the processing directory will be converted and copied over.</p><div class='title'><b>Run the Updater</b></div><p>There is also a simple shell script that runs <a href="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility" title="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility">Matt Pannella</a>'s command line program with all of the settings that I like.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I use this stuff pretty often when new cores and new features are released, so there continue to be more updates. When Playlists eventually come to the Pocket, I'll have a new program to make those. I'm also working on another program that will make a list of games I have in my "unsorted" directories for each core.</p><p>The Pocket continues to be one of the absolute best gaming devices made, and being able to make all this stuff to organize games has gotten back into programming on the side. It's been pretty great. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock Bot" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>With the world in lockdown, late last year I decided to look into what it would take to start streaming video games on the Internet. I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer from Amazon, and after a lot of tweaks, I have my stream running pretty well through OBS and broadcasting to Twitch. I've had a small following, too, so I've made a Discord to chat with people while I'm not streaming.</p><p>You can find me on Twitch here: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock">https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock</a><br/>You can join my Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK">https://discord.gg/...</a></p><p>These days I've been playing a lot of Let's Go Eevee on stream. In each stream, I hunt for Shiny pokemon and eventually I plan on collecting all of them. In order to make my streams more engaging, I have created a Chat Bot that has various games and activities. This is <b>Schock Bot</b>.</p><p>Schlock Bot is a locally run program. When it is active, it'll connect to Twitch and Discord. It will read every message in the Twitch chat and every message in the Bot channel on Discord. If a command appears, it will respond. It is written in Java with connections to MySQL. Recently, I retro-fitted Tapestry into it, so it will also host webpages, which I use as Twitch overlays.</p><p>On Git-hub, you can view all the current functionality and how to use it. For Twitch Chat, its main function is taking bets on which Shiny Pokemon will appear next in Let's Go. Also, there's a guessing game, which will give the Chat hints on a Pokemon. The first one to guess will get points!</p><p>You can view the entire project here: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot">https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot</a></p><p>It's been really fun getting back into programming. It is really satisfying that while building this thing everything really came together. And then being able to use it immediately on stream and have real people interact with it. It's great. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Plans</b></div><p>Rock blocks are always what slows down progress and kills motivation, though. Nearly everything I've been able to think of, I've been able to put into this, but there are 2 major things I wish to add that have not been working.</p><p><b>One</b>, I want to be able to listen for Channel Points redemptions and other Twitch notifications. Apparently you do this through Web hooks, but I haven't been able to get it working. With this working, I could automate a few things in the background rather than doing it manually.</p><p><b>Two</b>, I have Schlock Bot hosting web pages, which are connected in Twitch and displayed. But, again, I'm manually turning on and off their visibility. I want to make a host of other webpages that show the most recent followers and display graphics or play sound effects. I'm having trouble getting these pages working. There would need to be some kind of Ajax thing that would listen for a prompt, and then react accordingly.</p><p>With both of these things working, viewers could redeem points and have graphics show up on my stream or have a sound effect play.  Ya know, just like all the other obnoxious streamers.  Some day, this'll happen.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion Dammit" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit">Evangelion Dammit</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 15, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>How long ago was Evangelion 1.0 released in theaters?  I think it was around July 2007, wasn't it?  Even so, it's been out for a while.  And you'd think a die hard, unapologetic Evangelion fan such as myself would have seen it by now.  But I have not.  I guess I thought I was going to have or attend some big group watching Party with friends to see the rebirth, but that never happened.  At this point, I figured that the North American Bluray release would finally be the time I'd see it.  Funimation is releasing it in November 2009.</p><p>Anyways, this weekend was the first free weekend I've had for a while now.  So far on this lazy Saturday my accomplishments include: Watching the 5 most recent episodes of Late Night w/ Jimmy Fallon and sleeping on and off for about 12 or 14 hours.  As I ran out of Jimmy Fallon episodes to watch and read Eva fans going nuts over <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65" title="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65">Asuka's name change</a>, I thought about finally watching Evangelion 1.0.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 1: Finding a torrent</b></div><p>Finding a torrent for Evangelion 1.0 wasn't too difficult.  Though, my choices of which torrent to use was varied and confusing.  I finally picked one that had a decent amount of seeders and looked like an English language version.  It took about an hour or two to download.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 2: Playing the movie</b></div><p>The file I downloaded was a Matroska (MKV) file.  One of those ridiculous video formats that Anime geeks like because you can swap out subtitle files at your whim.  I thought I had means to play MKV files, but Media Player and DivX Player informed me that this was not the case.  <a href="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html" title="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html">Matroska dot Org</a> had the answers for me.  I downloaded a copy of Media Player Classic, and the video played perfectly. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 3: Subtitles</b></div><p>The torrent was kind enough to provide only the movie file.  So, when Shinji listened to the phone recording in the first moments of the film, it was in Japanese without the aid of subtitles.  It only took about 10 minutes of searching on Google to find a subtitle file.  (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf" title="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf">http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf</a>).  I opened up Evangelion 1.0 in Media Player Classic, set the subtitle file, and prepared to watch.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 4: Correcting the Subtitle file</b></div><p>Not every video file of Evangelion 1.0 is the same.  Some are recorded from a Camcorder in the theater.  Some are directly ripped from the DVD release.  Whatever the case, my copy of Evangelion 1.0 has about 32 seconds of Company IDs at the beginning before the film actually begins, which the subtitle file doesn't take into account.  So, Subtitles start to appear 32 seconds before any dialogue is said.</p><p>The whole beauty of the MKV format is that you can make your own subtitle files.  The subtitles aren't hardcoded on the video.  You can edit them.  So, I'll just fix the subtitle file by changing every time in it.  I'd do it by hand, except there are over 1000 lines of dialogue to change.  I could write a program much faster than I could do fix by hand.  Plus, it would be much more interesting.</p><p>So, that's what I did.  Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java">github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/EvaSubtitleFixer.java</a>.  If you want to use it, feel free. ^_^  You might want to change the ORIGINAL_LOCATION to whatever your subtitle file is called.  And change OFFSET_BY_SECONDS to however many seconds your subtitle file is off.  It'll plop a file called subtitles_fixes.srt in your C directory.</p><p>I guess this'll really only work with Subtitle files of the srt format.  I'm not sure how the other subtitle formats are designed.  I just took one look at the SRT file and figured out the pattern instantly.</p><p><i>Update: I wrote that code in a web application, so you can use it right now without needing any compilers or experience or whatever.  The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a><br/><br/><b>Success</b></p><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MGS4 Development" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mgs4-development">MGS4 Development</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I bought something rather frivolous.  When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Relax" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/relax">Relax</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I can hear everything they do, what they're touching, what they're thinking.  They've infected my senses and ruined everything.  ugh.. I'm outta here.</p><p>The problem was that some part of the program was doing something it wasn't supposed to.  This particular class assumed that whoever used it, did so in a specific order.  The class didn't really give any clues about the correct order.  Apparently whoever uses this class is supposed to look into the class and study it completely first.  Ya know, really get to know who you're dealing with.  Only when you knew everything there it to know about the class, could you use it with the at-most efficiency.  Fixing the error is easy, but that doesn't solve the problem.  This class needs a little redirection on what it means to be "user-friendly".</p><p>Out of one world and into another.  The park was pretty nice, but overall a waste of time.  There are a thousand other things I could be doing rather than laying in the sun.  Stuff is backing up at work, I could probably do some of that.  I have two discs from Netflix I haven't watched either, I could probably do those both at once.  I just hooked up my PS2, though, so I could start playing some of those games.  So many things to do.</p><p>A little bit of refactoring brings the class back into society a new and better person.  The error is fixed and shouldn't return in the future.  A perfect little cog in the machine...</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to More HSSF dumbass" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/more-hssf-dumbass">More HSSF dumbass</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A month or two ago I wrote about a Java package for writing and reading excel documents named POI+HSSF, which stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation + Horrible SpreadSheet Format. <a href="/old/v7/poihssf-using-excel-with-java" title="/poihssf-using-excel-with-java">Read all about it.</a></p><p>Today, I had to write an importer for a bunch of data in an excel sheet, so I figured I should use what I know.  Everything seemed to go find until I got to cells containing dates.  My cell I wanted to read simple said '10/11', but it was a formatted date.  Underneath, the data said 10/11/2007.</p><p>No Problem, I setup a SimpleDateFormat and treated the cell as a string.<br/><pre>public static final SimpleDateFormat DATE_FORMAT = new SimpleDateFormat("MM/dd");</p><p>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        String date = cell.getRichStringCellValue().getString();<br/><span />        return DATE_FORMAT(date);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(ParseException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Unfortunately, this threw a NumberFormatException, stating that the cell had numeric contents.  O_o?? what?  I debugged my code, and found out the numeric value of cell was 39366.0.  "Ok," I thought..  "I can see where POI may have thought it was 10/11, or 10/11/2007.. but those don't add up."</p><p>I called over a co-worker to show him this weird-ness, and one of us suddenly thought.. maybe it's number of days.  I divided the number by 365 and sure enough.. it equated to 107.8..  which is about that many years since 1900.  haha!  success!</p><p>I changed my code to work with this...<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span />        return new Date(millis);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Well, this is also incorrect..  My dates would come back with the correct day, but the year was 2077!  What the...  When using new Date(millis), the millis is the number of milliseconds from January 1st, 1970, not 1900.  So, now I need to correct for that.<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span /> <span />        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />        cal.setTimeInMillis(millis); //days since 1970<br/><span />        cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, cal.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 70); //remove 70 years diff.</p><p><span />        return cal.getTime();<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>After using Java's standard way of messing with dates, we've done it!  Correctly written a function that should have already been part of the POI+HSSF sdk.</p><p>but wait!</p><p>I started getting a couple of NumberFormatExceptions with my importation.  Apparently, a couple cells in the excel sheet ARE actual text fields and not dates.  These fields simply had a date in the month/day format..  no year.</p><p>So... now I had to account for this...<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span /> <span />        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />        cal.setTimeInMillis(millis); //days since 1970<br/><span />        cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, cal.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 70); //remove 70 years diff.</p><p><span />        return cal.getTime();<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        try<br/><span />        {<br/><span />            String date = cell.getRichStringCellValue().getString();<br/><span />            Date dates = DATE_FORMAT.parse(date);</p><p><span />            Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />            cal.setTime(dates);<br/><span />            cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2007); //assumes year is 2007<br/><span />            return cal.getTime();<br/><span />        }<br/><span />        catch(ParseException e2)<br/><span />        {<br/><span />            throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e2);<br/><span />        }<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Ok..  looks good, right?  wrong..  If the cell is empty, HSSF considers this as 0 for Numeric and "" for String values.  So, I need to add in some checks so we don't parse an empty cell as a date, which would come back as January 1st, 1900.  Also, a null check for cell, would be a good idea too.</p><p>This whole function has begun to really bulk up..  I guess that's why they don't have it in their SDK.</p><div class='title'><b>Who Cares?</b></div><p>Anyways, I thought it was rather interesting that Excel stores dates as days.  I guess that means you can't store a date/time value in a single cell then.  One cell for the date, the other cell for the time.</p><p>I find it also kinda funny that Microsoft and Java don't agree on when to start the day counter.  I swear I've seen another program or language that counts days or time starting at 1940.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to POI+HSSF: Using Excel with Java" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/poihssf-using-excel-with-java">POI+HSSF: Using Excel with Java</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, my work day was spent using POI HSSF, which can read and write Excel spreadsheets in Java.  You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Migrations" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/migrations">Migrations</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

So instead of going into the office I can do whatever I want.  Funny that, I ended up spending close to 6 hours both finishing up that poorly written Metroid Prime and migrating all my Movable Type journal entries to this Wordpress blog.</p><p>The main bulk of that time was cutting out the 24,000 comments from prescription drug companies, magazine, and pornographic websites.  After toying around, they were all posted on one article, so cutting them out was pretty easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Exporting Movable Type into Wordpress</b></div><p>Movable Type's exporting is quite amazing, by the way.  It dumps all the articles into a text file   They have a bizzare format, but it's still pretty readable:<br/><pre>--------<br/>AUTHOR: dyre<br/>TITLE: stuff?<br/>STATUS: Draft<br/>ALLOW COMMENTS: 0<br/>CONVERT BREAKS: __default__<br/>ALLOW PINGS: 0<br/>PRIMARY CATEGORY: daily<br/>CATEGORY: daily</p><p>DATE: 10/09/2003 08:43:39 AM<br/>-----<br/>BODY:<br/>omitted boring emotional text.<br/>-----<br/>EXTENDED BODY:</p><p>-----<br/>EXCERPT:</p><p>-----<br/>KEYWORDS:</p><p>-----</pre><br/><pre><br/>--------</pre><br/>Even though Wordpress is an annoying piece of crap, it has a convient "import from Movable Type" feature, which is very helpful.  So Importing all these old entries really only took 5 minutes.  200 more articles in 5 whole minutes..  not bad.</p><div class='title'><b>Upkeep on old stale articles</b></div><p>Despite my best judgement, I decided not to cut out content related to my life at the time, so there's plenty of school related articles talking about how lazy I can be, what classes I was attending, what homework I need to do and also several articles talking about my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>All those personal articles really tappered off when broke up with her and took a 9 or 10 month break from the internet, so around April 2004 my articles became more about the subject I was writting about and less about what I did that weekend or how I felt about the crushing stress of finishing off a semester at Platteville.  Paints an emotional picture doesn't it?</p><p>To fit all these new articles, I added a couple new categories, and also organized them into sub-groups.  I also made an <b>Opinion</b> category for all my reviews, gamelogs, and impressions about various Games, Moves, Music Events and such.</p><div class='title'><b>Still more</b></div><p>There are still plenty of articles that predate installing Movable Type that I haven't gathered up, but I could easily make a program that would convert all those entries into a Movable Type backup file, and have Wordpress import them.  Handy!</p><p>Many of these are very old reviews, but are still pretty funny..  like my Treasure Planet review, Kingdom Hearts review, and Magnolia review..  Now that I finished up Metroid, maybe that's what I'll work on.</p><div class='title'><b>Bored?</b></div><p>Well, if you're really bored, feel free to go back in time and read all those articles.  It's not like these haven't already been on the internet over at <a href="/old/v7/journal" title="/journal">theschlock.com/journal</a>, so you don't really gain anything new from reading them, unless you haven't read them.  You'd probably want to use the Search engine and category trees to your advantage to finding the better articles though.</p><p>Some of my old reviews are kinda funny at least.  especially my timely <a href="/old/v7/metriod-prime-2-impressions" title="/metriod-prime-2-impressions">Metroid Prime 2 review</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>ADVICE</b></div><p>by the way, NEVER use wordpress's entry edited for writing your blog posts.  Wordpress uses some funky CSS and Javascript to make your articles look like they do after you submit them.  BUT because of this, the text field is not longer a trackable DOM field.  SO when you submit an article, the text is immediately whisked away to the HTTP request and the field is blanked out.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means if you end up getting any browser errors, domain errors.. basically any error at all: <b><em>You lose your entire post!</em></b>  I've had this happen to me enough, that I don't even use the editor unless I'm actually edited an entry.</p><p>I use Wordpad to actually write out all my entries, and then I just copy and paste them into the editor, hit save, and then hit publish.</p><p>I'm currently using Wordpress 2.0.4, so maybe they've fixed it, but I'm not taking any chances anymore.  Especially when Firefox is somewhat buggy too and can crash at will.</p><p>Something to think about anyways..</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Concurrency in Java" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/concurrency-in-java">Concurrency in Java</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hey everyone.  These past few days, I've been doing a lot of work making some of our processors concurrently work on things.  Concurrency is the idea of having your program do many things at once, rather than linearly.  The major positive of doing this is a sharp performance gain.  For example, if you have 10 tasks that take 1 minute each to accomplish.  If you have one person do all these tasks it'll take 10 minutes.  If you have 10 equal people do one each, it'll take 1 minute to do all the work.  Pretty basic concept.</p><p>What's not so basic is how to go about implementing this in your code.  Let's say you have a function that does your work to complete this task:<br/><pre>public void doWork()<br/>{<br/>   ...<br/>}</pre><br/>and you have some Manager Class that is continuously running, looking for something to do.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         doWork();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>where acquireWork() will return null if there's no work to do.  Pretty standard operations.  You give this thing 10 1 minute tasks, it'll take 10 minutes to do them.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's use Threading!</b></div><p>Let's split some of this stuff up and use Threading.  Threads will spawn a new process that works aside from your current program.  When you start up a Thread, your main process will go on its merry way and let the thread do all the work.</p><p>To make a process run on a thread, you need your class to implement Runnable, and put all your work in the run() method you must implement..  So, let's do that with our doWork method.<br/><pre>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>now, back in our while(true) loop, we can spin off threads to do all the work, rather than getting holding up processor time doing all the work ourselves.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         new Thread(new WorkerThread(work)).start();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>the start() method will spin off your thread, while your main processor goes back to find more work for threads to do.  You give this thing 10 1 minutes tasks, it'll take around a minute for all those tasks to complete, but it'll take virtually no time for the main processor.</p><p><b>Note!</b> Do not use threads when your task operates on an overall chunk of data.  You want to give threads task that can be done completely independent of each other.</p><p>Not bad eh?  You've got the thing running smokin' fast..  Almost too fast though..  what happens when you get 100 tasks, or 1000 tasks.. or 1,000,000 tasks?!  You're going to run out of resources very fast, and eventually your program will probably throw some Out Of Memory Exceptions.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's not use Threading</b></div><p>You need to manage this stuff so it doesn't <em>spin</em> out of control.  That's where Executors come into play.  Executors manage all of your threads in a thread pool.  The main class you want to use is the ThreadPoolExecutor which has severals parameters in its constructor.  You specify how big your pool is, which type of waiting queue to use, how long to hold onto created threads, and, optionally, can specify a saturation policy.</p><p>It's quite customizable, so it can be confusing at first.  The Executors class is comprized of static methods with commonly used, pre-built ThreadPoolExecutors for ya.</p><p>There's the fixed pool executor, which will hold onto a specific amount of threads and when all those threads are busy it'll queue up the extras.  This is the perfect way to throttle the amount of work going on at once.  Say you have 10 1 minute tasks, but want only 5 people to work on them (budget reasons, probably).  When you get these 10 tasks at once, all 5 will work on the first 5 and when they finish them, they'll grab the next one in the queue.  If you get 1000 tasks, 995 of 'em will go straight to the queue.</p><p>There's also a cached pool executor, which will grow will the work.  It'll create new threads when there's a ton of work, but once things die down, it'll start giving back the resources to keep these threads alive.  meh..  There's not much difference in using a cached pool than starting up all the threads yourself.</p><p>Even though, the fixed pool bottles necks a lot of the work, it'll save system resources and prevent the program from running out of memory.</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ExecutorService exec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>It looks pretty indentical to the previous code.  Now it'll take about 2 minutes to go through those 10 1 minute tasks, but the program won't die when it gets 1,000,000 tasks.</p><div class='title'><b>Customizing the Executor</b></div><p>We can do better than this.</p><p>The workers are happy with their tasks, but the main process is going crazy.  Every little task that comes along will be taken right away and throw in the queue for the workers.  That's not too bad, unless you're doing some sort of transaction service.  If you open up a Transaction everytime you acquireWork, then you'll have 1,000 open transaction waiting to be processed sitting in the queue.</p><p>You could do away with the waiting pool completely, and never have an open task sitting in the queue.  This isn't such a bad idea, but what do you when all your threads are busy, and you give a new task to the executor?  You need a Saturation policy that will tell the executor what to do in this case.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturation Policies</b></div><p>By default, the Executor uses the Abort Policy, which just throws an exception.  Well, we probably don't want to do that.  There are two other ones that are available that aren't so great either:  DiscardPolicy, which will discard the new task, and DiscardOldestPolicy, which will discard the oldest piece of work that a thread is working on.  You defintely don't want to lose work, so discarding is out.  (and) Discarding the oldest piece of work?  You'd get into a cycle of constantly throwing away half worked on tasks.  Nothing would get done except the last remaining pieces of work.</p><p>If we're going to use a saturation policy, then we should use the Caller Runs policy, which uses the main process to execute the newest task when all threads are busy.  Then by the time the main processor finishes a task, the other threads should be ready to receive more work..  hell if not, the main processor can do the next one too.</p><p>This works out pretty well, since when times are busy everyone is jumping in to do the work.  The manager actually lend a helping hand ^_^.</p><p>There's one big problem with this though.  What happens when you have variable task lengths, and the manager ends up getting one that takes far longer to complete than normal?  Everything is held up by that one task, and your performance dips very quickly.  You should really only use this when you have tasks of predictable uniform completion time.</p><p>All of our tasks take 1 minute to complete, so using a Caller Runs policy should be fine.</p><p>I should note that the static Executors method return an ExecutorService, not a ThreadPoolExecutor, which actually have the setRejectionHandler that you use to set the saturation policy.  So you'll need to work around a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>This is pretty good except for one problem..  When you get six pieces of work, the 5 worker threads will get their work and the manager will work on the 6th.  Before the manager finishes task #6, all 5 workers will have finished their tasks, and now must wait for the manager to finish before they can get anything new.  Now you're wasting time again.</p><p>You can solve this by going back and using the waiting queue.  If you have your waiting queue the same size as your thread pool, then in that time when those workers finish their first piece of work, they'll have something new to work on right away.  When the manager finishes up his piece of work, the queue should be empty and ready to receive more work.  Very streamlined.</p><p>Now you'll need to actually make your own ThreadPoolExecutor, rather than using the pre-built one.  I start off by just copying the code from the Executors class and tweaking it a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec =  new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 5,<br/>              0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,<br/>              new LinkedBlockingQueue(5));<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>The LinkedBlockQueue is your waiting pool, and you must set the size in its constructor.I suppose one problem with this setup is.. What if you get 6 tasks, and then another 5 tasks a few seconds later?  Then, by the time the manager finishes up with task #6, the 5 workers will already been done and waiting for work.  Maybe this isn't the best implementation afterall..</p><p>but if you're working with a steady workflow and uniformally timed tasks..  you'll be fine.</p><div class='title'><b>Semaphores</b></div><p>Let's do something else..  Let's not use the Caller Runs policy, and let the manager just manage the workflow.  Instead of having the manager grabbing an extra task that can't be performed on because everyone is busy, we can halt the process until something is available by using a Semaphore.</p><p>A semaphore will have a certain amount of tickets that is acquired by using semaphore.acquire().  If you only give the Semaphore 10 tickets to hand out, you can only run semaphore.acquire() 10 times.  On the 11th time, semaphore.acquire() will wait for a ticket to be returned.  You return tickets be running semaphore.release().</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.  We want our ticket taker before any processing, and then the threads must return the tickets when they're done with their task.<br/><pre>private Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10);</p><p>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      semaphore.acquire();<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work, this));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</p><p>public void releaseSemaphore()<br/>{<br/>   semaphore.release();<br/>}</p><p>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;<br/>   private Manager manager;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work, Manager manager)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>      this.manager = manager;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>      manager.releaseSemaphor();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>Now the manager isn't constantly grabbing tasks when everyone is busy.  The semaphore will let him know when there's space free for a new task.  We don't need to setup a saturation policy, nor a waiting pool size, because with 5 worker threads and 10 tickets, the waiting queue will never exceed 5 tasks.</p><p>This seems like it would work pretty good in all situation.  The main processor isn't held up by anything, the worker threads will always have some work to do.</p><p>Not too shabby..</p><div class='title'><b>Fine-Tuning the Thread Pool</b></div><p>You can still get your processing power performance up just a little bit.  When a thread pool gets a task, it doesn't simply run Thread.start on it.  The task immediately goes into your blocking queue, and threads will take the task out of there to work on.  You have 3 basic types of Block Queues to use.</p><p>The LinkedBlockQueue I've found to be the slowest.  It uses your typical LinkedList setup.  The ArrayBlockingQueue runs faster, by using an Array.</p><p>If you don't plan on having any sort of waiting pool, you should definitely use the SynchronousQueue, which doesn't hold on to your tasks at all.  It passes them to a worker thread right away, without delay.</p><div class='title'><b>There you have it</b></div><p>There you have it..  running concurrent processes will provide you a decent performance gain, but make sure you manage them properly, or else you may be in trouble.</p><p>Never use Thread().start..  Use Executors instead.</p><p>The information was learning through reading the book Java: Concurrency in Practice, written by Brain Goetz with Tim Peierls, Joshua Block, Joseph Bowbeer, Dave Holmes, and Doug Lea.  Definitely check it out for more information of concurrency ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera's Wii Browser Extended API" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/operas-wii-browser-extended-api">Opera's Wii Browser Extended API</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
