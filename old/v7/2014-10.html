Within this building are all the government offices which run all the affairs within the Tokyo district <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>東京都</span></span>, which includes all the small towns and cities outside of the metropolis, too.  This "building" is split into 2 separate large buildings, building number 1 and building number 2, and the assembly building, too.</p><p>Building No. 1 is the more prominent and the taller of the two.  It's also the one mostly featured in the following photos.  It has 48 floors, 3 of which are under ground.  At floor 33, the building separates into 2 separate towers, which gives it its distinct look.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Within Metro Building No. 1 on Floor 45 of both towers is an observation deck.  It's one of the semi-lesser known sightseeing locations in Tokyo.  Most people are concerned with Tokyo Skytree, or Tokyo Tower.  Unlike those locations, the observation decks on both towers are completely FREE to anyone, and it's open most days out of the year.  Building No. 1 was actually the tallest building in Tokyo, at 243 meters until 2006.  Floor 45 is at 202 meters.</p><p>Dirk, Zach and I visited the building on a Sunday, so there were almost no people around the building.  There were some tourists, but it was mostly vacant.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When entering the Metro Building square, the assembly building looks like a command ship, and it's main assembly room watches over everything that happens in the area.  It's offices form arms that reach out and surround the entire area, hugging it, and watching over it.  It's an odd feeling.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love the architecture of this place.  If the surrounding building didn't create enough claustrophobia, Metro Building No. 1 shoots straight into the sky, and peers back down at you.</p><p>We went inside and had our choice between visiting the North or South tower first.  We chose the North for some reason.  After going through some light security, we were whisked directly to the top floor by special elevator.  We arrived, and were given a great view of the city.</p><p>Here is the view further west.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The weather was very nice and clear.  It was not clear enough to see Mt. Fuji, though, unfortunately.  I think the map said it would appear above that large soccer field near where the two photos meet.  I'll try to visit Skytree in December when the air tends to be more clear, and see if I can get a photo.</p><p>Tokyo is such an urban sprawl.  Even in the visible distance, you can't see any mountain or line of nature.  It's all buildings, with the occasional patch of green for a park.

It just continues and continues.  The choking hold of humanity.  It has creeped over all the available space, and now must ascend into the sky to make room for more and more people.  There are so many buildings, with so many tiny apartments.  Enough to fit 12 million people.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0870_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="twoColumnLast column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0861_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/><!--div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0900_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div--><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The view to the west was most interesting.

Things change, and the Tokyo Tower still stands to remind us of the past, in the shadow of the present.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" /></p><p>It's construction finished in 1958, more than 55 years ago.  It was originally built as a antenna to broadcast television and radio signals throughout the metropolis.  It's height ensured the signal would travel far enough to the households of Tokyo, and prevent the unnecessary construction of many shorter towers.</p><p>The architect, Tachu Naito, chose the Eiffel Tower as the design because it's structural sound design could withstand massive earthquakes, and torrential Typhoon winds.  He improved the design slightly increases the height 30 meters above the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>Unfortunately, with the conversation to digital television, Tokyo Tower was too short to completely cover the Tokyo area with the digital signal.

The Spring festival celebrates the Sanno Shrine <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>山王神社</span></span>, and takes places on the southern end of downtown Takayama.  I wrote about that one here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.  The Fall festival is on October 9th and 10th, and centers on the Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>八幡神社</span></span>.  This is the more northern area of downtown Takayama, and is much closer to my house. :)</p><p>Thousands of tourists, both domestic and foreign, come to Takayama to view the beautiful and hand-crafted festival floats, or yatai <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>屋台</span></span>.  The floats are pulled out of storage, and displayed for the town to see.  Every year, there are marionette performances <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>からくり奉納</span></span>, and a procession of the shrine <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>御巡幸</span></span>.  At night, the floats are lined with lanterns, and paraded through town.  </p><p>This year, the crowds were really sparse.  Perhaps only one thousand people actually attended.  The newspaper blamed the eruption of Ontake-yama, and the recent typhoons.</p><p>Both festival days were weekdays, so I could only attend the night parade, as usual.  This was better than last year, though, which had the night parade canceled due to rain.</p><div class='title'><b>Night Parade <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>夜祭</span></span></b></div><p>I arrived after the parade started, but that's fine.  It began at 6pm, and continued until 8:30pm or 9pm.  It mostly circled through the streets downtown, so it was very easy to go down side streets and catch up with the start of the parade.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last few floats were still waiting at the starting point when I reached Hachiman shrine.  Circling around to the start was easy.  I tried to watch the Shi-shi performance, but the crowd was too large to get a good view.  One of my 4<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>年生</span></span> students found me.  She's a tiny girl less than a meter tall.  She could not see either.  </p><p>She had me follow her to the next point ahead of the parade, and we waited while see showed me her pictures.  There were almost no people there either, so we had a front view of everything.  The Shi-shi arrived and waved to the crowd.  All of the teenage and child Shi-shi dancers were students of mine (past and present).  One yelled out, "Hey Jimu!"  The whole crowd was silent as I replied, "Hello!"</p><p>They continued walking on, and the floats followed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are 11 floats in the Takayama Fall Festival.

During the harvest moon the remaining fields are collected.  Now, it's the hunter's turn to gather food for the winter.</p><p>I observed the Harvest Moon last month: <a href="/old/v7/september-moon" title="/september-moon" title="/september-moon">September 8th</a>.  I was lucky because this happened to be a Super Moon as well.</p><div class='title'><b>Wednesday October 8th</b></div><p>This month's full moon was also a coincidence of two celestial events.  As the full Hunter's Moon continued into Wednesday night, a total lunar eclipse happened as well.  When this occurs, the moon darkens, and turns red from the residual light.  In effect, this creates a "blood" moon.</p><p>Wednesday evening's weather was even more clear than Tuesday.  For the first time since Spring, you could completely view Norikura-dake, and the Kita Alps.  You could even see the steam still rising from Ontake-yama's eruption.  As I returned home from work, the moon was no where in the sky.  At 5pm the previous night, the moon was a fixture in the sky.  Now, nothing was in the sky.  Meh, I ate dinner.</p><p>Next to Hida Takayama High School, on Nakayama (i think?) is a park that completely overlooks the town.  Skypark <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>スカイパーク</span></span> has a clear view of the eastern sky as well, which is where the moon will rise.  I went there at 5:30pm, and several other moon gazers had the same idea.  Photographers lined the edge of the park looking at the town, and prepared for the moon.  Several others continued to arrive.</p><p>Clouds had moved in, so Norikura was no longer visible.  But, behind those clouds lay a massive light, that had begun to rise.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8675_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8694.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8694.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8694.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8694.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141007_moon/IMG_8694.webp" /></p><p>The moon climbed over the clouds, then hung in the sky over looking Takayama.

| October 6, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>When shopping for video games in Japan, I think a lot of people think about going to Akihabara in Tokyo, or perhaps Den Den Town in Osaka, or one of the other popularized meccas of video game and anime nerdom.  But, if you've ever gone to any popularized retro gaming place in the U.S., their selection is great, but their prices typically are not.  Much like the U.S., there are tons of used stores throughout the country, and they usually yield better scores.</p><p>I currently live in Takayama in Gifu, and while the gaming stores are pathetic in my city, Toyama <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>富山市</span></span>, an hour and a half to the north, has quite a few, for some reason.  Gifu City <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>岐阜市</span></span>, Kanazawa <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>金沢市</span></span>, Matsumoto <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>松本市</span></span>, and Nagoya <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>名古屋</span></span> are within the same distance and time frame (in different directions), but they don't have nearly the cache Toyama does.  I don't know why.</p><p>I hadn't been on a video game shopping trip in quite a while, and my brother-in-law recently decided to repair and mod his Super Nintendo for import games.  He asked me to search for some games, along with the list of Famicom games I've been working on.</p><p>I'm not completely familiar with the Super Famicom library, but whatever. Let's go!</p><div class='title'><b>Shuttle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>シャトル</span></span> in Tonami <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>砺波</span></span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" /></p><p>I left my house around 8:30am, and went directly the first place on my list.  This was my first time going to Shuttle.  To find used game stores using Google Maps, I usually search for <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ファミコン</span></span>, and that pulls up stores that carry Famicom games.  Chances are if they carry those games, they carry all games.
