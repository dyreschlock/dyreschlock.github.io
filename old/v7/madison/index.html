| July 31, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I was back in the US, I visited Madison for only a brief 8 hours before moving on. I visited State St and the Square and was shocked at how much the place had fallen apart, due to a combination of Covid and people working from home. Stores were boarded up and gone. They were in the process of tearing down some buildings. And homeless folks were everywhere.</p><p>There were always homeless people in Madison, but they were among the many other people walking around, working, and living in the area. Now, it felt empty and ravaged. I don't think the downtown area of Madison was the only place in America that has fallen apart in recent years. (Visiting the city during a rainstorm probably also contributed to the gloomy atmosphere.)</p><p>Anyways, one of my destinations in Madison was to visit where I used to work, Widen Enterprises. After graduating university, I worked for Widen Enterprises as a Software Developer for over 7 years and then worked abroad for them a litlte bit after coming to Japan.</p><p>Widen Enterprises had a history of print which began in the 40s. They first began detailing and manufacturing plates for newsprint and then broke into catalog printing in the 60s. In the 90s, they invested in developing a user interface and backend that would aid their customers and building these catalogs. This move was perfect syngery with their printing service.</p><p>However, with the Internet becoming more and more ubiquitous, print died and their software division grew considerably. During my years of working there, the printing division became smaller and smaller. The basement used to have huge printers for all their costumer's catalogs. As company's workflows moved online, less and less were printing and these printers just took up space. Just after I left, I think the entire print division was disbanded.</p><p>Widen's Digital Asset Management system grew to become their main focus and now it had become their only focus. When I began work there, we occupied half of the top floor. After I left, the building was remodeled and development took over the entire ground floor.</p><p>Even before the Covid years, I think many developers and staff worked from home at least one day a week. And then during Covid, I think everyone switched to remote working. Not uncommon for companies in the US.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, in September 2021, they sold the company to Acquia. Acquia's main product is a line of content management software for your enterprise website. Having a digital asset management system is powerful tool to allow your costumers to host all their product images and use their software to build their corporate website or commerical website around it.</p><p>Over the 4 years of ownership and looking at some staff listsing at Acquia, it looks like much of the brilliant excellent folks at Widen have been moved into more senior roles within Acquia. From other rumors, it seems like much of Widen's staff has either been absorbed into other areas of Acquia or left the company altogether.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the old Widen building is for sale. It is no longer used by any developers or staff still working on DAM, wherever they may be. I think Widen had been at this location since the late 60s or 70s? Some of the other print buildings in the area still look like they're in business. It seems like a blight to have one of the major businesses in the area gone.</p><p>Someone had recently mowed the lawn, so it doesn't look too bad. But there are still some overgrown plants around the parking lot. Nobody comes here. (The overgrowth is much more present on Google Street View.) I'm not sure when they sold the building. Maybe it was still being used in late 2023?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While I was in the US, I drove past many corporate buildings and businesses that were completely empty because of the workforce moving online. I'm not a fan of working from home, but my commute to work is only 5 minutes in this dense mountain town. If I had to drive 45 minutes to work every day in a dense metro traffic, I would probably prefer working from home, too.</p><p>While everything feels like it's falling apart in the states, I think it's a consequence of transitioning the next (or another) form of our society. And change hurts.</p><p>It still <a href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead" title="/toys-r-us-is-dead">sucks that another one of my former workplaces is gone.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Richie Hawtin's CNTRL Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/richie-hawtins-cntrl-tour">Richie Hawtin's CNTRL Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 6, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, legendary DJ Richie Hawtin came to Madison on his CNTRL Tour, which comes with the title "Beyond EDM".  The Beyond EDM moniker is the driving force behind this tour, and has several meanings behind itself.</p><p>Initially my thoughts were that "Beyond EDM" meant an exposure to other genres outside of the massive popularity of Electro House, Dubstep, Pop House, some Trance, and everything you hear on the radio, in most clubs, and so forth.  Many of the new kids to the scene don't realize the rich history and beautiful sounds of true House, Techno, and other more minimal genres that built the scene back in the day.</p><p>But, aside from exposure, the "Beyond EDM" meant something else, and something more.  In the strictest sense, "Beyond EDM" means there's more than just the music.</p><p>"Beyond EDM" means connections.  The wonderful thing about nearly all of electronic dance music is the community that supports it.  For those who are fans, it's about connecting with other fans and artists, supporting them, and sharing music.  For those who are artists, it's about reaching your fans, growing your fanbase, connecting with other artists, and supporting them too.  Support and Collaboration.</p><p>The best (and most unique) thing about Richie Hawtin's CNTRL tour was the education and community focus.  Earlier in the evening, Hawtin held a round-table style discussion and lecture at each of his tour stops, completely free.  Hawtin had 3 or 4 other panelists, and they would discuss various topics such as "the business of EDM", "EDM: Now and Then", "The evolving artist", etc.</p><p>In Madison, Hawtin held his lecture at the Madison Media Institute in southeast Madison.  It almost immediately sold out.  Along with Richie Hawtin, Kevin Saunderson, Ean Golden, Gaise, and Kurt Eckes, from Drop Bass Network all sat in front of us all and talked about EDM for about 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp"  /></p><p>The whole format was mostly question and answer, but the questions were a little bit leading, and were really more like prompts that guided the information the panelists wanted to say.</p><p>And I wrote a bunch of notes...</p><div class='title'><b>Rave Act</b></div><p>The first main topic of the night was history.  With the explosion of EDM today, we need to look at the past to make sure the same mistakes won't happen again.  Electronic dance music was rather prevalent in the late 90s with the rave scene, but it died out.  What happened?</p><p>This question was directed at Kurt Eckes.  Eckes is one of the founders of the Drop Bass Network, a company responsible for some of the largest rave events across the midwest in the mid 90s to the 2000s.  So, what killed his events?</p><p>Kurt had a few answers, but his main answer was the Rave Act, and the negative publicity of raves in general.  The Rave Act basically slammed an event where any illegal substance was found with a massive fine.  Cops would have the authority to raid any event they believed had a substance, and run through everyone there until they found something, or were satisfied enough, and left.</p><p>This was a huge bummer for several reasons.  Kurt admitted that nearly all of the parties he put on were illegal.  They never checked for drugs, and they pretty much didn't care.  After the Rave Act was introduced, it was way too risky to continue the way they were.  Hiring a bunch of security guards was a bummer.  And if, on the off chance, a party attendee brought something, and the Cops raided the place, he'd be slammed by the law.</p><p>Aside from that, other companies that did throw legal parties were still getting busted.  The cops would shut down the music, have everyone on the ground, and comb the place for an hour.  That's not a fun night for anyone, whether or not they actually find something.</p><p>The Rave Act killed the fun, and made everything too damn risky.  And Kurt's personal interest in the business was beginning to wane, and it just felt like too much damn work to go through all the red tape.</p><div class='title'><b>Clubs</b></div><p>One solution to the problem was to move the scene into the clubs.  But this had its own problem.  The club scene is not the rave scene.  Aside from banning illegal substances, clubs had strict operating hours.  Most of the places in the midwest had to close at 3am.  Most raves went until dawn, or even past dawn, continued through the next day, and night.  Raves never stop, but clubs certainly do.</p><p>The Rave kids just weren't into the club scene, so they just didn't go.  And with raves dying out, they had nowhere to go, and basically quit the music scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Shorter Sets</b></div><p>Even the artists had to adapt to the time restrictions.  DJs could no longer spin a 5 or 6 hour set on their own, they only had a time slot of an hour or 2.  True DJs don't play song after song after song, they play a set.  Songs are chosen to build off of each other, and tell a story.  6 hours is plenty of time to tell a story and try out new things.  But now that time has shrunk.  You can't tell a 6 hour story in just one hour.  There's not enough time to build, and have variety.  And instead of having 30 minutes to build up, you only have about 3.</p><p>There's very little time to be creative and flesh out anything new, too.  Hawtin mentioned that he really needs a good 4 hour set to try out new things.</p><p>To tell all that you want to tell, you need to build the intensity much faster with the shorter sets.  The story is condensed, and faster.</p><div class='title'><b>Larger Shows</b></div><p>Richie Hawtin asked the question, "Was the scene blowing up because of Skrillex, or did Skrillex blow up so fast because of how fast the scene grew?"  Obviously both the scene and Skrillex benefitted from each other greatly, but which one really started it?</p><p>Deadmau5 and Skrillex have raised the bar with the amount of production put into their stage performance at their shows.  But with the larger scale shows, this is so many more things that can go wrong.  Everything must be choreographed, and perfect for the show to be a hit.  Failure can be easy, so these DJs don't take as many risks anymore.  They can't.  They have to stick to a schedule, and can't be as flexible.</p><p>In fast, Deadmau5, who never considered himself a DJ in the first, really doesn't consider his artist persona his main job anymore.  He says that his title is an "event driven marketer."</p><div class='title'><b>Music Sales Today</b></div><p>Another big difference between the scene today and yesterday is that Music does not sell the way it used to, which is really due to piracy.  The whole panel really didn't slam piracy at all while they were up there.  Exposure is exposure.  It's just another vehicle to get your music out there and heard.</p><p>Hawtin gave the comparison that the scene was about a tenth of the size back in the day, but they sold about 10 times more records.  Which is incredible to think of.  But!  They were selling actual records.  These days, you can buy a whole album for $2 on the internet (or just pirate it).  And there's a ridiculous amount of competition.</p><p>Piracy is real and the competition, and the artist needs to be aware of these things.  You cannot survive on record sales alone.  You have to go out and perform your music, and personally spread your unique sound.</p><p>Which means you have to think of the whole package when composing music.  You have to know exactly how you're going to play your track, and design the track itself to be heard live.  And, your music ends up being advertising for your live show, and your message.</p><p>That last part is definitely true for me.  These days, if I hear something I like, I seek out the artist, and if I really like what they're doing, I want to see them live.  The live experience is a completely different monster than hearing something on the computer, or the iphone.  It is the whole package.</p><div class='title'><b>Balancing performance and creation</b></div><p>Building music and advertise your music means that you'll be out on the road and in the clubs a lot.  Hawtin finds himself having to schedule time to actually create tracks...  which is difficult.  You can't schedule creativity.  You need to be prepared to act when inspiration strikes.</p><p>And that isn't all that hard these days.  A lot of the music people make is on their laptops, and the very laptops they bring around with them to perform.  Going from studio work to club performance is nearly seamless.  You can perform works in progress, and really craft your tracks on the fly.</p><div class='title'><b>Copy Cats</b></div><p>It's really easy to make music today.  It's great for the artists, but it has opened the door for a lot of imitation and unoriginality.</p><p>You can take someone else's idea and run with it if you like, but people aren't as stupid as you think.  Fans and other artists are very in tune with what they hear and what they like and can spot a fake almost immediately.  They see right through them.</p><p>If you have no substance, authenticity, or originality, then you won't get far.  You have to be you.  Be natural.  Be genuine.  And the distinctiveness will shine with time.</p><div class='title'><b>Technology</b></div><p>The next question asked if anyone on the panel found it difficult to be creative with the massive influx of technology in the scene.</p><p>Hawtin replied with, "Technology opened up music creatively for me."  (or something like that.  damn autocorrect.)</p><p>He posed the question to the audience, "Do you really really care if the DJ is using the sync function on stage?"  Most of the audience basically just said no.</p><p>He continued by stating that Beat Matching is really is more mechanical than creative.  The machines we use today are WAY more precise than a record and a turntable.  DJ no longer have to chase records, and constantly make sure everything is synced up.  Technology today is incredibly liberating.  It gives the DJ peace of mind.</p><p>As such, they're able to be more creative and complex.  Hawtin can blend more than just two tracks together, and build a more unique layered sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp"  /></p><p>He demonstrated what he meant by that.  He went over to his laptop, and ran some sounds with each other using Traktor.  He had one track supply the baseline, while he blended the melody of two other tracks on top of that, and a fourth track with some samples.  This kind of thing is just not feasible with turntables.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment</b></div><p>The next train of thought went to the environment.  While the music should stand on its own, you're kidding yourself if you don't think the environment doesn't enhance the music.  Whether it be the crowd, or visuals, or being animated on stand, the environment is part of the performance.  It's part of building that moment for the audience.  And for some people, it's the catalyst that launches them into music, and transports them to another place.</p><div class='title'><b>Be Proactive</b></div><p>The scene is build on the idea of DIY, Do It Yourself.  Don't wait for someone to discover you, get out there and do it yourself!  Connect with everyone around you, and build your vision.  Reach out!</p><p>As you build your sound, let people in.  Accept criticism.  Accept help.  And give help back.  Be transparent, share idea, and include those interested around you.  That's how this scene was originally built in the first place!</p><p>Celebrate our diverse opinions, and grow!</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>Experimentation with your inspiration is how you find yourself.</p><p>Saunderson mentioned that one of the first things he ever did was attempt to copy a sound, or copy a feeling.  He would hear something, and try to recreate it from scratch in the studio.  And out of building toward that sound, the feeling, he found his own sound.  It was what he heard, but now it was through his own voice.</p><p>While copying things outright is rather opaque, you need to start somewhere.  Chasing what you like will give you direction.  And through that journey, you will find yourself.  You just need to keep at it.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>There were a couple more topics, but those were all the notes that I wrote down.  Hawtin ended the lecture with a rather inspirational quote, <b>"Dig deeper and continue to explore.  This is an incredible time.  Don't be disillusioned because popstars are making EDM tunes."</b></p><p>These times are pretty exciting.  I've met more people in the last 2 years into this kind of music, that I have ever met before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Majestic</b></div><p>I met up with Bryan after the lecture, we had dinner, and then we went to The Majestic, where the panelists performed.  Ean Golden started off the evening with an eclectic selection of tracks that went back and forth a little too rapidly for me.</p><p>The night began for me when Gaiser took the stage, and performed live.  Beautiful, rich, heavy Techno.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Kevin Saunderson took the stage, and blended some beautiful House tracks together.  Followed up by Richie Hawtin.  Absolutely incredible night.</p><p>The whole package was something truly unique and special: an education and a mind blowing performance.</p><p>Also, I broke my goddamn camera :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shpongle the Masquerade @ The Majestic" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shpongle-the-masquerade-the-majestic">Shpongle the Masquerade @ The Majestic</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is the third time I've see him DJing some fantastic tracks from his back catalogue, and every time he always pulls out something amazing of his I hadn't heard before.</p><div class='title'><b>DJ sets</b></div><p>The first time I saw Simon performing a DJ set was almost exactly two years ago in Minneapolis.  He was at the Epic event center, formerly The Quest.  His 4th album, Ineffible Mysteries in Shpongleland, was just released and his set consisted mostly of those tracks, along with Shpongle's entire catalogue.  I finally heard some of my favorite songs live, and the "new" song I heard that night was "I am a Freak".  </p><p>"I am a Freak" is by Younger Brother which is Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan.  Younger Brother is also part of Simon's record label, Twisted.  And Benji Vaughan also performs as a solo artist, Prometheus, also on the Twisted record label.  That night, Simon also performed a couple songs from Hallucinogen in Dub.  Hallucinogen is Simon's psytrance persona, and Hallucinogen in Dub consists of psydub remixes by Ott, also on the Twisted label.</p><p>After that night, despite playing all of my favorite Shpongle tracks, I realized his DJ sets were more of a showcase for his label with an emphasis on Shpongle.  Which isn't a bad thing at all.  This gives him PLENTY of content to work with and build a unique performance every time.</p><p>Last year, Simon went on a full fledged US tour with his stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  He played a fantastic set of original songs, remixes, and plenty of other songs on the Twisted label.  That night he played another spiffy Younger Brother song I hadn't heard before: the Cicada remix of "All I Want".</p><p>And tonight, it was another unique Shpongle experience.  His set was full of remixed Shpongle tracks, and he only played a few original versions of the songs.  His encore was freakin' incredible.  He played some fantastic psytrance beats layered with an Irish tone.  It was amazing how well those two sounds complemented each other.  I was off the ground, and hopping around to that tune.  Fantastic!</p><p>Simon was in a group called Celtic Cross back in the day, so maybe he pulled a song from the single album they produced.  His encore felt live an overall medly of Shpongle tracks though, so maybe he just mixed or mashed something in at the end.</p><p>Also, the audience was restricted from any audio recordings during tonight's performance.  It could be that Simon was road testing some new material for his upcoming 5th Shpongle Album.  I definitely heard plenty of Shpongle-like tracks tonight that I hadn't heard before, and didn't sound like remixes either.  I'm definitely looking forward to that new album.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage Presence</b></div><p>Another unique thing about each Shpongle performance has been the stage presence.  In Minneapolis, Simon toured with the dance troup Archedream for Humankind, which performed unique dances tailored to each Shpongle track performed by Simon.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" /></p><p>Last year, the Sphongletron absolutely blew my mind.  It just looked like a dumb weird looking setup when we first walked into The Majestic, but the Shpongle head attached to the front came to life when it was fully illuminated.  The projected face on the stage setup moved, twisted, and contorted along with the music.  It was so bright and lifelike that it actually looked like it was moving on stage.  You can see this in some video I took <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg">here</a>.</p><p>The Sphongletron experience was definitely my favorite time seeing Shpongle. :D</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" /></p><p>Tonight, Simon was back with a new contraption known as The Masquerade, I guess.  It was much larger, and had much more canvas for the projector to paint onto, but it was nowhere near as amazing as the Shpongle head on the Sphongletron.  The Masquerade had only visuals moving about the white canvas, rather than the canvas actually moving and contorting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" /></p><p>It was still an amazing time, though.  All 3 of these performances were unique and amazing.</p><div class='title'><b>Shpongle in America</b></div><p>It's pretty great that he's roaming around the US quite a bit these days.  I first came across Shpongle just after he released Tales of the Inexpressible, his 2nd album, in 2001 and really wanted to see him live.  But he never toured.  At least, not in the US.  He'd do shows in Europe, and Australia, but never in the US.  And now he's been through the midwest each May for the past 2 years.</p><p>AND his DJ performances have improved quite a bit over the last 2 years.  In 2010, it just seemed like he was playing track after track without a whole lot of transition between them.  Last year, he's been stitching the tracks together much more fluidly.  And this year, it was all a choreographed set.  The underlying tone flowed throughout his entire performance, and each track got its spotlight.  He's improved quite a bit!</p><p>Definitely check Shpongle out if he comes to your town. :D<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Local Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-3-local-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Local Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The local scene has exploded over the last year, and we've actually been able to get some international talent as well thanks to the loyal scene in Madison.</p><p>Many events are pretty mainstream, but there are plenty of dudes in the area who have been DJing for more than 10 years, and know exactly where the music today comes from, and what makes the past so special, too.</p><p>Here are my favorite events I attended in town put on by some of the best talent in the Midwest.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Demetri Nocturnal, Psycotron, Scatter @ Poor Boy's Rave, Segredo // Dec 22nd</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/">http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/</a></p><p>No event was more surprising, or amazing than the second to last Poor Boy's Rave of the year.  It was a night of modern Psytrance that continued to be infused with classic Trance hits from the late 90s and 2000 until that beautiful classic sound took over completely.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp"  /></p><p>After Wyatt's opening set, Scatter took the stage and set the mood was some groovy Psytrance beats.</p><p>I don't pay attention to this genre at all, but it was very different than the Hallucinogen and Infected Mushroom I was told were representative of this genre.  Modern day Psytrance (at least according to these guys) was very similar to the classic sound of Trance I was in love with back in the day.</p><p>Scatter continued to hold that classic sound but with a harder edge.  Pyscotron picked up exactly where Scatter left off, but his sound became more melodic and dreamy.</p><p>Demetri Nocturnal took the stage and played a set that was straight out of the year 2000.  I haven't heard these songs in YEARS.  It was like listening to Paul Oakenfold in his prime.  This was exactly the sound I heard in clubs when I first started going out, and the sound that I had completely forgotten about.  It was the reason I went out back in the day, and the reason I have such love for Electronic Dance Music these days.</p><p>I never thought I'd hear this again, and this is why it was the most amazing moment I had in Madison throughout the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>2. The Gimp @ Jump Around, The Cardinal // July 27th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/">http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/</a></p><p>Likewise, one night in July, the Milwaukee Noise Collective was invited to spin at Wyatt's monthy event at The Cardinal, Jump Around.  This was a week before Caleb's big summer party, and I was gearing up to DJ that party all night long.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp"  /></p><p>A couple DJs started off the night, but when The Gimp, aka Brandon Standal, took over the decks the atmosphere completely changed.  It was another set infused with classic DJ tracks that I hadn't heard since the year 2000, and it built a wonder sound.  I was so happy to be with a bunch of my friends at the time.  This was the sound I wanted to bring to Caleb's party.</p><p>Brandon built up the atmosphere with several tracks and then slammed us with Above &amp; Beyond - On a Good Day.  The original Club Mix, not the slightly harder Metropolis mashup.  It was euphoria.  A perfect blend of old and new.</p><div class='title'><b>3. The Horrorist @ Inferno // May 14th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/">http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/</a></p><p>This party was definitely the drunkest I had been all year.  My friends and I somewhat pre-gamed at the Come Back Inn with some Boots.  I slammed some Red Bulls, and we went off to Inferno shortly after.  I was drinking Spotted Cow all night, one after the other.  After the event ended, everyone went across the street to an after party on the second story of some supply store.  And we continued partying for another 2 hours probably, I dunno, I don't remember.  I probably got home around 5am?</p><p>All the opening DJs put an entertaining sets that really set the mood for the night.  Some very hard tracks, mostly Electro House and Techno.  As time progressed and the headliner loomed, the sound become very focused on Techno, and continue to bang pretty hard.</p><p>The Horrorist took the stage and started laying down tracks.  He picked up the microphone and provided all the vocals himself.  He yelled and screamed into the mic along with the beat, and the crowd went absolutely crazy to it.  We yelled at the top of our lungs back at him.  YEAHHH!</p><p>Aside from being drunk and manic due to beer and Red Bull, it was definitely the most energetic party I've ever been to in Madison.  The crowd was completely in tune with his performance, and after Inferno closed, the vibe continued at the after party.</p><p>Despite how ridiculously drunk I was, I remember so much of that night.  It's crazy how incredible and unique that night was that it shown through any attempts of memory blindness. Also, it was great to have company with me so we could piece the evening together at a later date.  It was my favorite drunken night of the year :)</p><p>I think that funniest thing about this was that on Monday, I found out that they recorded the audio from the entire night.  After listening to set performed by The Horrorist, it really didn't sound all that great.  It was a fantastic night, but the majesty of it all was really in his stage presence and ridiculous amount energy pumping up the crowd.  That kind of thing doesn't translate to audio so well. :/</p><p>It was a night that you truly had to be there to experience it all.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Alex Hall @ Wobble, Electric Earth // Halloween</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/">http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/</a></p><p>Alex Hall is a member and featured artist of one of the music forums that I've frequented for quite a while now.  Hybridized.org specialized in Progressive Trance, and Progressive Breaks mostly.  The have huge acts such as Hybrid and Way Out West, but these days focuses a whole lot more on rising talent across the world.</p><p>Alex Hall became a member around the same time I found the forums, but I had no idea he lived in the midwest!  I came across his name on this event, and made it my mission to be in attendance.</p><p>A lot of the Wobble crew threw down some groovy sets, but mixed in some occasion medicore tracks.  One of the openers had some amazing classic Acid House tracks, but then mixed them into Skrillex, bleehhh.  One of the other openers started off with some Drum 'n Bass, and Alex Hall yelled out from the back room, "Drum 'n Bass is for pussies!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp"  /></p><p>Alex Hall took the stage as Satan.  This was the same night Wolfgang Gartner was at Segredo, and Alex's opening remarks were, "Who needs Wolfgang Gartner!  Let's Party!".</p><p>He spun a modern techno set with plenty recent huge hits including Pryda - Moksha and Eric Prydz - Personal Jesus.  It was great to hear such big name sound coming from a Wisconsin resident.  He ended on Mike Koglin - Enjoy the Silence and absolutely blew my mind.</p><p>It was a remarkable Halloween night.  Far better than what Wolfgang would've offered. :)</p><div class='title'><b>5. Wyatt Agard</b></div><p>@ The Cardinal (closing out a dead night)<br/>@ Segredo (opening for Halo)</p><p>Through the year, Wyatt has put on a ridiculous amount of shows.  He DJs at various gigs at least 3 or 4 times a week, and sometimes every single day of the week.  He puts on special events at The Majestic, holds a monthly show at The Cardinal, and weekly shows at Jolly Bobs, and Segredo.</p><p>Wyatt's an amazing dude, and there were two moments throughout the year that really popped for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp"  /></p><p>One late summer's eve at The Cardinal, the place was pretty much dead.  There was a bunch of people there at one point, but never more than 30 people on the dance floor, and eventually they all left leaving me alone out there to groove along.  Wyatt mixed in some of the amazing tracks throughout his set, and built a very progressive vibe.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo">Booka Shade - Regenerate (Pan Pot Remix)</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8">Moby - Pale Horses (Gui Boratto Remix)</a>, and some mashed up remix of Xpander (or at least it sounded like it.)</p><p>These were all tracks I had been groovy to over the summer, and it was great to hear them live. :)</p><p>Later on, when opening up for Halo Varga, he spun another fantastic Prog set.  And even managed to mix in an actual remix of Xpander, most likely the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8">Funkagenda Remix</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-2-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Popularity for DJs soured in 2011.  DJs of all genres and tastes are in high demand, and the promoters of Chicago worked their asses off all year round.</p><p>And with the massive success of the North Coast Music Festival in 2010, promotion company React opened up their own night club, The Mid.  The Mid saw an unprecedented amount of talent week after week after week.</p><p>Through the year, the following events were my favorites, and almost all of my favorite tracks of the year ended up on the turntables at them one way or another.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Kings of Progressive House</b></div><p>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo @ Sound-Bar, Chicago // December 16th<br/>Sasha @ The Mid, Chicago // March 12th<br/>John Digweed @ The Mid, Chicago // March 23rd</p><p>All 4 of the best in Progressive House visited Chicago throughout the year.  John Digweed and Hernan Cattaneo stopped by twice!  All of these guys are my favorite DJs, and having the chance to see them all live in a single year absolutely blows my mind.</p><p>But out these nights, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo was the clear Event of the Year for me.  After trying to see Nick live for the past 8 years, the top person on my music bucket list was finally crossed off.  They spun for over 4 hours, and fed off of each other the whole time.  Nick was create some massive builds, and Hernan continued the plateau of that build into his couple of tracks.  Back and forth, back and forth, it was absolutely brilliant.  Here's my words about it from the day after: <a href="/old/v7/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago" title="/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago">December 18th</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>Sasha's set from March was unlike anything I'd heard from him lately.  He had been building up his Never say Never vibe which was mostly Tech House, and Indie tracks.  It was a very light, glowing, and joyful sound from him.  By his March set from The Mid pulled him back into the pure darkness.  It was a dark set filled with Progressive House and Techno.  It completely blind sided me, and carried the rich atmosphere that made me a Sasha fan in the first place.</p><p>Digweed's set from March felt like a showcase of all the talent he would later release in the year.  It was right in the middle of WMC, and it felt like he was road testing a whole lot of tracks for the upcoming weekend.  Among them was my favorite track of the year, Meridian, and many other beautiful and banging tracks.  It was on a Wednesday as well, so the vibe wasn't really as crazy as the weekend, either.</p><p>I kind of wish I would've went down there for Digweed's follow up set in May, but I was busy in Madison that weekend.  Having him on a proper weekend date would have been special. :)</p><div class='title'><b>2. North Coast Music Festival</b></div><p>Carl Cox, James Zabiela, Ida Engberg, Steve Bug</p><p>With PAX scheduled one weekend before Labor Day, I had all weekend to take in Chicago's massive Electronic Dance Music festival.  And I wrote a detailed diary of everything I did that weekend.</p><p>Day 1 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-1" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-1">Friday September 2nd</a><br/>Day 2 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">Saturday September 3rd</a><br/>Day 3 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-3" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-3">Sunday September 4th</a></p><p>While it was heavy with mainstream acts, North Coast had so much going on at anyone time, there was something for everyone.  Many of the acts that I attended were refreshing and classic compared to the many Electro House, and Dubstep acts of today.</p><p>James Zabiela spun and scratched some amazing breaky tracks on Friday.  It had been so long since I have heard any breakbeats live, I had almost forgot what they sounded like.  His set at the festival was only a taste of the mayhem he brought to Sound Bar that evening.  He mixed breaks into some amazing progressive house tracks.  It was fantastic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>Carl Cox blew my mind the next day as he performed a massive genre bending set that ripped into the crowd around his stage.  He spun Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz towards the beginning of his set, absolutely ruined the crowd, and kept up that energy and electricity throughout the rest of his set.  It was incredible.</p><p>For an after party, Five and I went to see Andy Moor at Vision.  While not a sanctioned North Coast after party, it was another highlight on my weekend.  It was great to hear harmonizing hard trance that didn't feel too generic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp"  /></p><p>At the end of Sunday, I went to Transit for a night of that classic House sound I grew up hearing in Minneapolis.  Steve Bug played a solid smooth House set, and Ida Engberg pumped up the energy with her brand of Techno.</p><p>It was a fantastic (and beautiful) weekend, and one of the best of the best of the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>3. M83 @ First Avenue, Minneapolis // November 16th</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp"  /></p><p>On a Wednesday in November, I drove up to Minneapolis and finally had the chance to see M83, one of my favorite bands.  I am a huge fan of their songs Teen Angst, Couluers, and their new lead single Midnight City.  The event was part of their tour for their new double length album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.</p><p>And seeing them live for the first (real) time was a dream.  They played all of their amazing hits from the new album, and all of their amazing hits from their previous album, Saturday = Youth, and plenty of amazing tracks from their past.  Hearing Teen Angst live and Couleurs live had been a dream of mine for a while, and it was another moment of crossing things off my music bucket list.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp"  /></p><p>As soon as they started playing Midnight City, all of First Ave was hopping up in the air, and tearing the roof off of the place.  It was tremendous, and a true show of how everyone there was feeling the exact same vibe.  From hipsters to business men, from moms to teens, from loving couples to singles, everyone embraced in the love pounding from the stage.  It was absolutely one of the best moments of the year.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Twisted in Madison</b></div><p>Shpongle @ The Majestic, Madison // April 26th<br/>Ott @ The Majestic, Madison // March 18th</p><p>My favorite psychedelic artists were on tour in 2011, and both of them made their way to Madison for two very special nights.  Twisted is the record label both them are a part of, though I think Ott may have split from them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp"  /></p><p>Ott was fresh off releasing a new album, Mir, with the beautiful and surreal track Adrift in Hilbert Space.  He had been to Madison the year before, but his 2011 experience showed a more enthusiastic and motivated Ott.  He was no longer just performing the same songs he already had.  His new album invigorated him, and that energy passed on to the crowd.</p><p>The whole night was a journey into his unique sound, and it was fantastic being there with like minded fans from the area.</p><p>The same thing happened again one month later with Shpongle, aka Simon Posford, label boss of the Twisted label.  Simon took us through a journey of Shpongle's greatest hits mixed in with several tracks from other artists on the Twisted label.  He was DJing in Minneapolis the year before, but to hear him locally at the Majestic with so many other fans was truly special.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp"  /></p><p>The event was as music visual as it was aural.  Shpongle brought with him the Sphongletron, a unique stage setup the used LEDs, back projectors, and a power front projector that illuminated the Shpongle head on the front of the Sphongletron.  The Shpongle light up during songs, and the lighting moved around the head to give the impression of a physical moving light.  And then!  The head started to move!  The head opened up his mouth, and his tongue started licking around his face.  And then!  The head began to twist and turn along with the trippy music.  At first, I had no idea what was going on.  It looked like the physical statue was moving and contorting on its own.  It was amazing and mesmerizing.</p><p>It was a night as unique as their respective sounds, and fantastic to seem them just down the street from where I lived. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phantogram-high-noon-madison">Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Phantogram is an American indie band with members Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel.  According to wikipedia, they formed in 2007, but I don't think anyone really heard of them until 2009.  And 2010 is really when they got their "big break", so to speak.</p><div class='title'><b>Eyelid Movies Tour</b></div><p>I was introduced to them last year, right as they started their first national tour for the release of their upcoming debut album, <b>Eyelid Movies</b>.  I saw them on the upcoming board for High Noon Saloon, and my brother, Bill, had mentioned that they were pretty good, and that I'd probably like them.  I listened to some of their songs, and definitely liked them indeed.</p><p>On my birthday last year was when they came into Madison, and my local record store, Strictly Discs, had them put on an intimate in-store performance limited to 50 people.  I got down there the moment they opened up, and made sure to secure my place in line.  Well, it turned out that not a lot of people had heard of this.  Or they weren't interested.  I came back around 3pm when they were actually performing, and was 1 out about 30 people who listened to their short 30 minute set.</p><p>It was pretty fantastic.  They have a very melodic tone that builds a very ambient atmosphere, followed with a drum beat that guides the melodic and chorus of songs.  It's relaxing, but still energetic.  It paints a picture in my mind, every time I hear their songs.</p><p>I recorded the whole performance, last year: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4" title="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4</a></p><p>After they finished, everyone met upstairs for a quick meet-and-greet.  They brought along Vinyl copies of their yet unreleased album.  So I bought one of those, and got it signed by Josh and Sarah.  Unfortunately, I missed their performance at The High Noon later on due to birthday drinking.</p><p>Birthday Drinking wasn't a problem this year, because they came into town one day after. And the concert was on a Monday night, so I wasn't about to get shit-faced on a work night.</p><div class='title'><b>Nightlife Tour</b></div><p>It had been a while since I heard anything about Phantogram.  I saw them on High Noon's upcoming list, and had wondered if they were going to perform anything new since last year.  All of the concerts I had heard leading up to last year, were the same 11 tracks from their album.</p><p>Once again, my brother Bill sent me a link for an upcoming mini-album titled <b>Nightlife</b>.  It had 6 songs, but it still gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard them.  Some songs were rather similar to their earlier stuff.  But others actually iterated on their style, went in a few different directions, but kept their sound in tact.  I really like <b>Turning into Stone</b>, which seems to channel Moby but keeps it in their own voice.</p><p>Last night, they performed at The High Noon Saloon to a sold out crowd.  Sold out! on a Monday night, even.  Phantogram's popularity is exploding right now.  Many critics have very high praise for <b>Nightlife</b>, and even publications such as Wired are even commenting on them.  It's kind of crazy.  I doubt it would be possible to do an intimate in-store performance with them as the place would be overrun.</p><p>Along with greater popularity and a greater crowd, their stage performance has expanded.  They hired a drummer, rather than using a drum looping kit, or whatever.  Using a live drummer really makes their sound POP even more than before.  <b>They are much better live now.</b> Before it just sounded the same.</p><p>They brought along a bunch of lazers and lights too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp"  /></p><p>The crowd at the High Noon was interesting.  There were plenty of girls, hipsters, and kids totally into the indie scene.  They probably follow pitchfork, who have been talking this band up.  Right in the front were a bunch of bros whom I wouldn't think would attend such a show.  In fact, they were the most into Phantogram out of the whole audience.  They were probably drunk, but their hands were in the air the whole time, and they were rockin' out.  They bought me beer, too. :)</p><p>I recorded some video, but I mostly took a bunch of pictures.  I think I took enough notes to identify their set list, too.</p><p>1. ???

| September 19, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For his "College Invasion" Fall tour, larger than life, trance superstar DJ Tiesto, made Madison, WI one of his stops.  What?  It's kinda odd thinking about Tiesto performing in Madison.</p><p>Though, given how the scene has been exploding around here, and local bookers have been getting some serious talent to come to our town, AND how this is a college tour and Madison is one of top 10 schools in the country, I guess it makes sense.  This is a DJ concert anyway.  He's not playing in some fancy douche bag club.</p><p>Tickets were a mere $37, which is cheap compared to almost any gig in the last 5 years. Also, he took the trouble to come to my town. He's bringing the show to me! I can walk to the damn concert. So, I decided to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Merchandising</b></div><p>To prove just how big a sellout he is, upon entering the lobby of the Alliant Energy Center, I'm greeted with several booths selling and advertising shit.</p><p>There's Tiesto's merchandise booth with a whole lot of overpriced T-Shirts, and other crap.  There's a photo booth!  You can get your picture standing next to a picture background of Tiesto!  Hot Damn!  There was a booth that had the Playstation Move setup showing off some game.  There was a booth with energy drinks.  And another for Axe Body spray.</p><p>I think the bigger offense was during Porter Robinson's opening set.  The huge LED display behind would switch to ads! Which advertised the merchandise booth out in the lobby.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp"  /></p><p>People love rockin' out to T-Shirts!</p><div class='title'><b>Porter Robinson</b></div><p>Opening for Tiesto was Porter Robinson.  I got there around 8:30pm, so I caught the last half hour of his set before Tiesto began at 9pm.  As I entered, he was jammin to a remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4">Deadmau5 - Raise your Weapon</a> that sounded like Madeon's fantastic remix.  It was much longer, and the extended parts didn't sound like it at all, so maybe it was a mashup, or something.</p><p>He set was pretty cookie cutter.  He played songs similar to what I've heard the locals spin around here.  He threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc">Wolfgang Gartner - Illmerica</a> towards the end, which felt like he was going for the popular vote, rather than building his own sound.  (At least, I think it was Illmerica.  It was some well known Wolfgang song.)</p><p>But whatever, I only caught the last half hour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Tiesto</b></div><p>Man, I got there at the perfect time.  I didn't have to stand through any of the openers at all.  30 minutes after I arrived, Tiesto took the stage and started up his set.</p><p>I got the recorded the first 70 minutes of this (plus a few other clips), so take a look for yourself.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627</a></p><p>He starts off which a self indulging intro.  It's probably the club life theme song.  After he throws in a sample of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk">Imogen Heap - Hide &amp; Seek</a> (I thought it was BT at first), and starts hopping from trance anthem to trance anthem, and eventually goes into more Big Room (or whatever) House.  He pretty much kept with the Housey trend throughout the rest of the set, though some songs still kept a trancey vibe.  It's the kind of sound that he's known for these days.</p><p>He DID throw in a few classic tracks, which was a pleasant surprise.  One of which was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw">Delerium - Silence (Tiesto Remix)</a>.  Only it WASN'T the Tiesto Remix!  Arrgghh.  It was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4">W&amp;W + Jonas Stenberg Remix.</a> This song is evil.  It uses the exact same build up as the Tiesto mix, but then shits all over itself with a breaky climax, rather than the beautiful atmospheric sound of the original.  Fuck this song.</p><p>I caught a few other songs too, but I don't remember their names.  (I did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0">record</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ">them</a>, though.)   He ended with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujB7A5ycew" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujB7A5ycew">Tiesto v.

This is the exhibition hall in the Alliant Energy Center.  A huge room surrounded by concrete and steel.  And, as Zack reminds me, the same place were they have horse shows, and monster truck rallies.  It's the same basic layout as an airline hanger.</p><p>The accoustics are horrible.  The bass bounces off all the walls, and makes a thunderous sound that echos through the entire space.  It drowns out any actual noise from the bass itself.  It turns into this Boom-Boom-Boom.  So, every bass line is identical throughout the set.  You can hear this quite plainly in the video I took.</p><p>The rest of the levels were jacked up, so you COULD make out what the songs actually were.  But even that had echo in this huge concrete hall.  Certainly not as much echo as the bass, but it still blurred the songs a tad.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>A Good Time</b></div><p>While, I'm pretty down on Tiesto, and he is a total sellout and a bit of a hack, I had a great time.  But, with my expectations so damn low to begin with, there's no place to go but up!</p><p>The crowd was quite amazing, too.  I think that was the biggest surprise for me.  There were some college kids there, but they were mostly in the huge bit in front of the stage.  Hanging back in the comfortable section were the actual fans.  Tiesto fans maybe, but definitely Trance fans.  Clubbers from Chicago and Milwaukee, and a bunch of kids that just wanted to dance and have fun.  There weren't any huge assholes.</p><p>When Tiesto hit on his mark with the Trance hits, everyone in the crowd was dancing and cheering.  Everyone was totally in the moment with this concert.  People were actually paying attention!  Rather than typing on their phone, or yelling at each other, or trying to feel each other up.</p><p>I haven't seen a crowd this responsive in a while.  But maybe this could be because it was on a weekday rather than a weekend, and people weren't drinking the night away.  And most trance fans are older than the new crop of EDM fans who are into dubstep, electro house, and all that stuff.</p><p>I had fun :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music-2">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The senate rammed the end of collective bargaining through on Wednesday.  The assembly passed it on Thursday.  And Walker signed for it on Friday.  Despite the constant protests, the republicans of Wisconsin did not care at all.  "Busting" the unions was their ultimate goal and financial situations played no part in it.</p><p>The people of Wisconsin, and citizens of the Midwest responded by showing up to the Capitol on Saturday to show their disapproval.</p><p>The Saturday rally comprised of 2 events.  Before Noon, the Wisconsin Farmer's Association drove their tractors to the Capitol and circled the square for about an hour in solidarity.  At 2pm, the main rally took place on the State St. side of the Capitol with several musical acts and speakers.</p><p>Jess, Jon and I got up to the Square to check out the tractors, which was more parade-like that protesting.  I don't really have any pictures of that because it was about as interesting as a parade.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp"  /></p><p>After roaming around for a while, we went to lunch.
