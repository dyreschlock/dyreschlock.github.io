The storm extended itself to Madison, WI, but the temperatures were much higher in our region than the North.  It was a beautiful warm winter day at 40 degrees.

What could have been snow accomulation turned into an inch of ice beneath the 5 or 6 inches that continued into the night.</p><p>Oh well, we were still dumped on.</p><p>I had nothing to do today.

| January 25, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the past week, I've been to a couple music events in Madison that were pretty fun.  I love living in a town where all the great venues, bars, and other attractions are all in one small area.  A town large enough to foster, nurture, and bring in some amazing talent.  Yet, small enough that I can get anywhere in 30 minutes at most. ^_^  Especially when it's January and the weather is horrible.</p><p><b>Dustin Zahn @ High Noon</b> // Jan 15th</p><p>Last weekend, we caught word of some amazing music at the High Noon and stopped there for the evening.  The air was filled with an amazing energy of raw techno, house and a little electro.  Dustin Zahn kept the crowd moving all night long.  It was one of the best nights I've had in Madison.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v9HdtyPlDEM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v9HdtyPlDEM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"> </embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/arEZg4aH40k&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/arEZg4aH40k&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Rez!</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MHDEVO1HcYE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MHDEVO1HcYE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Dustin Zahn hails from Minneapolis, which explains a lot.  The whole night gave off the vibe of a mid-90s rave.  The kind that were prevalent in niche corners of the USA, and especially in Minneapolis.  The Minneapolis rave scene gave birth to the amazing talent and fans that surge in Minneapolis today.  Last weekend was a glimpse into that pure energy.</p><p><b>Holy F*ck @ Majestic</b> // Jan 22nd</p><p>This weekend, Madison played host to Toronto's "must-see live act" Holy Fuck.  Apparently, these guys have "redefined" what it means to give a live performance by using their raw common-sense genius to build up new songs and sounds that make every one of their shows unique.</p><p>Unfortunately...  they conducted a DJ set.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>They played some pretty awesome songs.  And after hearing what I recorded, some of the other songs sound pretty good too.  But, they came at the tail end of a horrible performance by a DJ duo known as the Fun Cartel.</p><p>The Fun Cartel are two guys with opposing musical tastes and skill.  The skinny afro guy was pretty cool.  But his sidekick would throw in tracks that completely ruined the vibe.  In addition, they failed almost each one of their transitions.  In the end, their set felt like a 3 year old's finger painting.  "Let's just throw in all of our favorite songs.  Orange mixes with Blue, right?!"  Ugh..</p><p>Also, our dinner plans for the evening didn't go so hot either.</p><p><b>Erebus @ The Annex</b> // Jan 23rd</p><p>Erebus is not in my realm of music.  They are Metal.  And while their music is definitely different than mine, metal fans could not love their music more.  Metal fans are born to rock, congregate, and mosh together.  Erebus does an amazing job of channeling that passion, energy and fandom into something that anyone with a strong passion for music can love.</p><p>Examples:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Even though there were probably 30 people or less in attendance, Erebus performed with such enthusiasm and attention that everything they did on stage was clearly meant for us.  We were the reason they were on stage.  The songs they chose, the monologues spoken.. it was all for us.  And the true fans reciprocated by doing what Metal fans do:  Hopping off the stage, slamming into each other, head bangin', and truly rockin' out.</p><p>I've seen them a couple times before, but this was truly their best night, in my opinion.  Though, I might be semi-biased.  Erebus' lead members are Dave and Gage.  Gage is one of my good friends in Madison.  We met at Widen back when we were both interns.  I first saw them perform live almost exactly 3 years ago, when they first performed live themselves (<a href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show" title="/erebus-first-show">here</a>).</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways</b></div><p>Anyways, Madison is pretty amazing.  Great music at a small scale. Daedelus is coming to town in 3 weeks! King Cannibal in 2.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oysy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oysy">Oysy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The place was called <b>Oysy</b> and is located where Tumbleweed used to be.  Yes, that disgusting unappetizing restaurant went out of business, thank god.  And now we have a Sushi buffet?  We definitely got the better end of the deal on that one.  Since Dave was in town on Friday, he and I went to try it out.</p><p>They certainly had a rather large selection of foods.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp"  /></p><p>They had crab legs, chicken teriyaki shish-kabobs, salmon, shrimp, tempura shrimp, tempura brocolli, tempura squash, kalamari, octopus, frog legs, prawns, oysters, and so on....</p><p>The salmon wasn't too bad, and the tempura shrimp and veggies were great.

It was pretty decent, though it wasn't gourmet by any means.  It tasted identical to the sushi you can find at Copps, actually.  They had plenty of sushi chefs on staff preparing it and putting it out immediately.  But again, the quality is nothing compared to what you'll find at Takumi or Sushi Muramoto.</p><p>They had plenty of Japanese beers, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp"  /></p><p>Their buffet was the only food item on the menu, and for a $20 entry fee, the price is a little steep.  If you're going to dine for Japanese tonight, I would definitely recommend any other Japanese restaurant in Madison.  Takumi and Sushi Muramoto are absolutely delicious for Sushi, and Ginza and Takara are fantastic too with a more well-rounded menu.</p><p>I don't want to bash on the place because I love Japanese food and it's great to see a new restaurant open that isn't just Sushi or Teppanyaki and has more variety, but...  you can do better.</p><p>I really wish a Ramen restaurant would open in Madison or somewhere nearby.  The closest and only one I know of is in Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights, Chicago.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Healthcare March on Capitol Square" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/healthcare-march-on-capitol-square">Healthcare March on Capitol Square</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Those with musical instruments started playing some "pump up" songs for the crowd.  And one of the guys with a megaphone started spreading the word.  "We're all here today for the same thing.  We want healthcare reform, and we want it now!  Let's march on the Capitol!"</p><p>And with that crowd began oozing down State, and completely screwing up traffic.

Unfortunately, I don't remember any of these people's names.  (With the exception of Tammy Baldwin, obviously).  I figured this event was pretty well covered given the turnout and news reporters at the scene.  But, I cannot find any information about this protest at all.  You'd think someone would've reported something.</p><p>Jesus, I guess in that way, this protest was a collosal failure.  Were the speeches given at the Capitol merely self serving choir preaching?</p><p>I don't follow politics at all, so most of the information didn't really stick on me.  The woman organizer talked about stuff.  Then they presented this old hippy with a plaque.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4617.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4617.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4622.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4622.webp"  /></p><p>Then a doctor took the podium.  He recanting a story of a 30 year old came through the ER having a diebetic episode.  He did not know he had diebetis, because he couldn't afford Health Insurance.  After the ER visit, he still couldn't afford health care..  3 months later, when he ran out of insulin, the doctor met his patient again in the ER.  He was in shock again from diebetis.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp"  /></p><p>Next up was a school teacher...

But because they don't make a whole lot of money on the farm, he can't afford healthcare for his family, nor his workers on the farm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4636.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4636.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4636.webp"  /></p><p>Next up, this women talked about her battle with Breast Cancer and how her insurance provider kept changing the grammar of her plan to avoid paying for "preventive" care.  Like Xrays, annual checkups.  It was pretty sad.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4638.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4638.webp"  /></p><p>This next guy was a great speaker.  This preacher talked about how his parents are great Americans, who've played by the "rules" the entire life.  They had great jobs, and supported the economy all these years.  But...  they worked for GM.  And because of the recession, GM would no longer provide extensive healthcare for their employees.</p><p>You may have great healthcare now, but what happens when those that provide it to you can no longer afford to do so?  He had always thought that there were two kinds of Americans..  those with healthcare, and those without.  However, with these economic times, he revised his statement:</p><p>There are 2 kinds of Americans:  Those that care about healthcare reform, and those that will in the future when they are forced to care.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4666.webp"  /></p><p>For their final demostration, Tammy Baldwin was given the podium.  She talked about how she's fighting for the public to have a choice in healthcare.  And how the other senators in Wisconsin don't know what they're doing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4667.webp"  /></p><p>"What do we want?" "Healthcare Reform" "When do we want it?" "Now!"</p><p>That's about it.</p><p>After that, the crowd began to disperse.  Leif, Caleb, and I met up with Zaher.  We went over to Genna's on the square and drank beer for a couple hours.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera in the Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/opera-in-the-park">Opera in the Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Opera in the Park, Brat Fest, Rhythm and Booms..  Art fair on the Square was pretty well attended too.  What other traditional Madison festivals and fairs are there?  At the end of the night, they announced that over 13,000 people were there which is pretty incredible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" /></p><p>The event started around 8pm and went on into the night.  The first two songs that began with I had heard in one form or another before hand, but had never heard the actual song.  Largo al factotum (the figaro song) and Anvil Chorus I remember from Looney Tunes. ^_^  The figaro song is also usually heard in commercials too.  Usually spaghetti sauce commercials.  I think it's kinda funny that the height of my opera experience was from other forms of media using it either poorly or commercially, but at least I had some exposure to it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was the perfect day for laying in the park listening to some fantastic music. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Madama Butterfly</b></div><p>Despite not knowing anything about Opera, there is one opera that I know of thanks to Asian American Literature at Platteville and that is Madama Butterfly.  I think we read the original short story, Madame Butterfly, the opera was based on.  It was rather brief, but gave us the background needed to start reading M. Butterfly, which is a play inspired by the book.</p><p>Madame Butterfly is about a Japanese Geisha woman in Nagasaki known to her friends as Butterfly.  She meets an US sailor, Pinkerton, who's ship is in town.  They fall in love and get married, but Pinkerton must return to the states.  The main emotion of the story is Butterfly's longing and loyality to Pinkerton as she continues to work as a Geisha   She continues to wait and wait and wait for his return, despite her friends constantly telling her that he's never going to return.  That he doesn't love her and it was just a little fling for him.  She continues to believe in Pinkerton.  AND.. Many twists and turns happen when Pinkerton finally returns to Nagasaki.</p><p>M. Butterfly is an interesting parallel tale of love between the actors who portrey the characters in a similar opera featuring cross-dressing and John Lithgow.</p><p>Anywho, Madama Butterfly is being performed by the Madison Opera in November!  I'm totally going.  I think I'll try to read the books again beforehand.  They also have a preview/lecture about the play a week before that'll probably be interesting, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Art Fair on the Square" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/art-fair-on-the-square">Art Fair on the Square</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

First, I bought a very nice end table from American TV in their clearance section. It matches my desk quite nicely and can house food and drinks, which previously took up real estate on my desk. A couple days later, I went to East-side Slumberland and bought a decent coffee table for super cheap from their clearance section. I thought it would look great on the other side of the my desk than my end table and could house my record player, which previously sat atop my foot locker.</p><p>My home work space is starting to feel quite spacious. ^_^</p><p>I haven't been living in my new place for long, and have really only given my new address to Netflix, and the post office; however, over the weekend, I got a very peculiar piece of mail at my new address. I got a small manilla-like colored envelope from Mr. Rob Leibfried whom has very bad handwriting. It was personally addressed to myself, living at my new address. "What in the hell is this?!" I inquired to those within earshot. I was somewhat creeped out..</p><p>Those feelings began to elevate as I opened the letter to find a "Thank You" card. Inside the Thank You note said, with horrible handwriting, "Thank you for your recent purchase, rob". I began to cycle through my memory the things I had purchased with this address in mind. The only place was Slumberland, since I didn't give my new address to American.</p><p>You'd think a little context would have been helpful since the guy I bought it from was completely rude. Kyle and I discussed this a little bit, and came to the conclusion that maybe the dude felt bad about it, or something like that. I still think it's incredibly bizarre.. I spent a whopping $40 on that coffee table, and its not even all that sturdy. Even though it was crazy cheap, I still feel like I was doing them the favor... hey, I guess that's why they thanked me, huh.</p><p>Anyways, today I'm at work and my phone rings with an unidentified number. I do what I usually do: Not answer, and type the number into google to identify it for myself. By the way, if I don't have your phone number in my phone and you give me a ring, please leave a message. Otherwise, I'll probably just ignore it, if I can't figure it out through google.</p><p>This particular phone number is 608-271-1000, which is the number to American TV. "What the hell do they want? I picked up my end-table when I bought it.. I didn't sign up for anything else, despite spending 30 minutes looking at TVs," I immediately thought. Luckily, I was left a message. "Hi there Jim, this is <blank> from American TV just asking if you're enjoying your recent purchase. Let me know if you need help with anything and I look forward to seeing you soon." Jesus Christ, needy much? If I had answered, what would we even talk about? It'd be the most awkward phone call I'd ever had been a part of. Also, "see you soon"?! How soon are we talking here? Like "you're going to break into my house and stab me with a knife" soon?</p><p>It is a really good End-table though. One of the most sturdy pieces of furniture I own, next to my file cabinet. I was actually rather lucky to find it at such a spiffy price.</p><p>But anyways, do all furniture stores train their employees this way? Ikea never called me about my desk and JC Penny never called about my file cabinet. This is borderline invasion of privacy. I assumed my address was used for billing purposes, not another entry into their Rolodex. This makes me think twice about buying a TV from American or clearance couch shopping at Slumberland.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 80s Prom porn @ Inferno" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/80s-prom-porn-inferno">80s Prom porn @ Inferno</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

To date, there has only been one ocassion where I left the establishment satisfied, which was around two years ago when Richard Divine tore up the place (<a href="/old/v7/richard-divine-inferno" title="/richard-divine-inferno">here what i wrote</a>).  The other two times at Inferno had been a stark disappointment.  Extremely low turn-outs..</p><p>When arriving at Inferno around 9:45pm, it seemed like I was being setup for disappointment again.  There were maybe a dozen or two people there, most of which were sipping drinks at the bar.  There was one group that was quite into the scene and were on the dance floor.</p><p>Brett and I found a table off to the side and perched ourselves for the night.  Despite having few people around, the track selection was absolutely amazing.  80s dance hit after 80s dance hit.  Amazing song I never remember this well, to several great songs I had never heard before.</p><p>DJ Smitty was the resident all night long and he kep the hits coming along.  His track selection was top notch.  Unfortunately though, he didn't mix any tracks together at all.  When one song ended, it was a quick to the next.  It was like getting punched in the side or pushed into a wall at the end of every song.  ughh..</p><p>I never got used to his hard cuts, but what can you do really?  The genre is 'retro' which covers ALL genres of dance from the 80s and other eras.  Track mixing really didn't become all that prevalent until the 90s..  I would've liked some effort but towards mixing, but all these songs are so radically different, it would probably be disastrous if you weren't already a mixing god.  Oh well...</p><p>The track selection made the night perfect, and as the night went on..  more and more people did begin to show up and started flocking to the dance floor.  The power of delicious 80s tracks truly did bring people into the venue despite Spring Break and a Snow Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" /></p><p>This event was the highest viewed for the month of March on Inferno's website, so I really wonder what kind of crowds this'll draw when it's not Spring Break and the weather is fine.  80s Night at Inferno is the 3rd Friday of each month, so I guess we'll see next time on April 18th.</p><p>April 18th also happens to be No Brand Con, so I won't be able to get any SPAMM friends to go, but if you aren't going up to Eau Claire that weekend, feel free to stop by Madison, ^_^</p><p>Favorite Track of the Night: Ghostbusters Theme ^_^.  Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough for Smitty to play my request of the Beverly Hills Cop Theme.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Barack Obama in Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/barack-obama-in-madison">Barack Obama in Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

We're probably past a total of 80 inches total for the year AND there's more to come on Thursday and Saturday.  Because of the snowfall, my fancy plans to travel to Minneapolis with Tony and attend the Cinematic Titanic launch party had failed.  Driving conditions were poor, so Madison we stayed.</p><p>Luckily, there was another high profile event happening in our very city.  Democratic Nominee, Barack Obama had a rally downtown at the Kohl Center.  An excellent Plan B to follow through.  So that's what we did. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting In</b></div><p>Obama's speech was set for 8pm, with the doors opening at 6:15pm.  I got there around 5:45pm and caught up to Tony without a problem.  But the crowds were massive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" /></p><p>It's kinda tough to see, but the wonderful people that organized the event decided to funnel the massive crowd of thousands into a single entrance way.  BRILLIANT!  By the time we arrived and the time we decided to screw the line we were in, we moved about 40 feet?  I think.. about a foot a minute.</p><p>Eventually they opened up other entrances, and we eventually positioned ourselves to a point where we could get inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" /></p><p>We entered the premises around 7:15pm..  7:30pm.  And, since we took forever to get inside, nearly every single seat in the building was taken.  After stooping around, we found some seats above the exit way that were covered up for unknown reasons.  Unknown enough for us, and another group, to pull the tarp off the seats and uncover the perfect spot to sit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" /></p><p>We had a nice little perch, and eventually the arena became more and more full.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Speech</b></div><p>The speech had several lead-ins, starting with the student organizer and the campus organizer.  Eventually, Governor Doyle took the stage to pronounce his support for Barack Obama.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" /></p><p>With the conclusion of his speech, Governor Doyle introduced "the next president of the United States", Barack Obama to uproarious applause and cheering.  It was a thunderous pounding roar that was really captivating and emotional.</p><p>On stage, Obama gave his speech about how he will bring about change and fix our broken country.  How the politics of the last 'decade' have screwed us and what we stand for.  I'm not a huge follower of Obama, but I can imagine it's quite similar to his other speeches.  He didn't really focus on health care or working class as much as the Bush Administration and the failed politics in Washington.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" /></p><p>It was incredibly powerful.  When you hear him on TV, you get a sense of how powerful his voice and his message are, but to hear them directly, with the same man in the same room amplifies the message and really hits you.  It's the same effect as listening to music on headphones or speakers versus going to a real club and feeling the pounding bass in your heart and being soaked with sound.</p><p>If I had one word to describe the evening, it would be "powerful."  Can't stop the signal.  Can't stop the message.  Hopefully, he will bring about change and fix everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, as the speech concluded, he closed on the same powerful note he kept reiterating.  "We will bring about change, and YES we can make it happen," and as he ended Tony and I got the crap outta there to beat the crowds.</p><p>All toll, the Kohl Center was packed beyond capacity.  Every single seat was filled.  All the aisles clogged.  The floor jam packed with as many people as possible.  And there was even an overflow room outside of the arena packed with people, who were treated to a speech prior to his actual message.</p><p>The papers and press tomorrow will probably have the exact count of attendees, which should be an interesting statistic.</p><p>Speaking of press, there were plenty of satelite linked vans outside as we exited.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" /></p><p>beep beep beep beep..  Can't stop the signal.</p><p>It's unfortunate, that Tony and I missed the Cinematic Titanic launch party, but I almost think this was a much better spent evening.  Hopefully, Joel and the rest of the gang will have a Wisconsin tour in the future.</p><p>Also, if you look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp">third-from-the-last</a> image above, you can see Waldo in the lower-left hand corner.
