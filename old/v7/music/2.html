| April 19, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Weekend on April 10th, Video Games Live performed in Minneapolis for their first time.  Video Games Live is headlined by seasoned video game music composers Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall who bring their compositions of popular video game franchises to your "local" orchestra and perform them.</p><p>This concert is meant to be a celebration of video games and game music.  Tallarico and Wall said that their mission with Video Games Live was to show all generations the legitimacy of games and how they've changes our lives and culture.  And it was a celebration.  This concert attracted all flavors of game enthusiasts from children and families to hipsters to hardcore gamers to casual gamers and to nerds and geeks in general.  There was a wide variety of cliques and cultures in the audience which is really proved their point.  Video Games aren't for some niche demographic, they're for everyone to enjoy.  It was neat to see everyone join together in harmony.</p><p>Here's the set list from the evening:</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. Metal Gear Solid<br/>3. God of War<br/>4. Space Invaders Demonstration<br/>5. History of Video Games<br/>6. Kingdom Hearts<br/>7. Martin Leung performs "Final Fantasy"<br/>8. The Legend of Zelda<br/>Intermission<br/>9. World of Warcraft<br/>10. Super Mario Brothers<br/>11. Martin Leung performs "Super Mario Brothers" while blindfolded<br/>12. Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross<br/>13. Guitar Hero "Van Halen - Jump"<br/>14. Halo<br/>Encore<br/>1. One Winged Angel - Final Fantasy VII<br/>2.

Distant Worlds</b></div><p>Video Games Live is strikingly similar to another video game themed 'concert' I've been to before entitled Distant Worlds.  Distant Worlds is a concert featuring music solely from Final Fantasy and created by primary Final Fantasy Composer Nobuo Uematsu.  Uematsu has been in charge of music in Final Fantasy since the beginning, and his concerts aren't really so much a celebration of Final Fantasy, but revisiting the music and compassion that made these games so memorable.</p><p>That's really the true division between Video Games Live and Distant Worlds.  Video Games Live's music simply represents a game.  Comparing Video Games Live and Distant Worlds is like comparing the question "Dude, do you remember Super Mario Brothers?" to the question "Do you remember how you felt when Yuna performed her dance for the souls of everyone in her camp?" (or whatever).  Yeah yeah, Super Mario Brothers NES doesn't lend itself well for emotion memorable experiences, but VGL performs music from other games that are such as Legend of Zelda and Metal Gear Solid.  Their performances didn't really engage me with the same emotion and life as any Final Fantasy song performed at Distant Worlds.</p><p>I think the real difference boils down to Video Games Live simply being a cover band.  That's not meant as an insult, but I think their songs are missing what made these games good and memorable to begin with.  In some cases the most memorable parts of these games was not the music.  Like World of Warcraft?  Does that game even have music?Â  And in other cases where the games have a clear memorable melody, it's not best expressed with an orchestra.  Like Guitar Hero with an Orchestra?!  Halo?  In both cases, Tallarico is using an electric guitar.  Yeah, that fits in an orchestra setting.  Though, their Castlevania song is pretty bitchin'</p><p>I think Distant Worlds is a much better performance because the songs are meant to capture and emphasize those emotional experiences, they same way any classic song should.  And with the original composes, Nobou Uematsu, behind it all, he ensures that the essence of the song is in tact and more powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of which...</b></div><p>Distant Worlds started back in 2008 and is still roaming the globe.  I saw them on March 1st 2008 on their first visit to Chicago.  They've already been back through there again.  Probably because it sold out immediately the first time.  They're coming through Chicago for a third time on August 1st, 2010 and tickets go on sale this Thursday.  This time they're performing at Ravina, wherever that is.</p><p><a href="http://ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=details&amp;id=26:ravinia-august-1-2010&amp;Itemid=62" title="http://ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=details&amp;id=26:ravinia-august-1-2010&amp;Itemid=62">Distant Worlds Link</a> - <a href="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=139" title="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=139">Ravina Link</a></p><p>Huzzah!</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Korg DS-10 &amp; Korg DS-10 Plus" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/korg-ds-10-korg-ds-10-plus">Korg DS-10 &amp; Korg DS-10 Plus</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 2, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The other night, Conan O'Brien visited my dreams.  It was a semi-normal dream for me.  Some friends and I went to some event at a movie studio.  The event was a tribute to Conan O'Brien that showed his legacy on Late Night.  It took place in a parking lot type area.  There were only about 30 of us, and we all sat in desks, like in a classroom.  I sat near the projector, which was also near the speaker, which was somewhat in the middle of all the desks.</p><p>We watched some clips, introduced some acts, and the speaker started playing a piano as Conan O'Brien showed up and started his speech.  In the middle of the speech/musical act, he hopped on the piano bench and tried to play, but could not.  Eventually the original speaker took over, and Conan sat in a desk in front of me.</p><p>He murmured something like, "I guess I should've learned the piano before trying to play."  I mentioned something like, "That's ok.  I don't know how to play either.  Though, I've always wanted to."  To which he retorted, <em>"Well, if you want to play the piano, you should buy one and start playing."</em></p><p>That's about where the dream ended for me.  I woke up with the phrase "Buy a Piano" echoing in my head.  It really reminded me of that episode of Futurama when advertisers implanted product placement in Fry's dreams.  Which WILL happen someday...</p><p>I do want to learn the Piano, but I think there's other things I've already started learning I should specialize in first, such as other facets of Software Development and Japanese Language.  I should probably return to Drawing at some point too...  But music is very much a part of my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Korg DS-10</b></div><p>I really don't have the money or room to buy an actual Piano, but I do already own a music instrument of sorts.  Almost one year ago, XSeed released <b>Korg DS-10</b> in the states, which was originally released in Japan on July 27th, 2008.  Korg is the world leader in synthesizers, but those are pretty expensive and sometimes huge.</p><p>Korg DS-10 is 'software' for your Nintendo DS that mimics the basic functionality of a synthesizer.  It gives you two synth tracks, four drum tracks, and plenty of FX and fades to mix them together, along with a song timeline to bring everything together and actually compose music.</p><p>Thanks to Conan's advice, I actually played around with it for a substantial amount of time last night.  I got the feel of how all the synths and drum synths are laid out, how they interact, and how everything comes together.</p><p>I am an extreme novice when it comes to actually making the music, and everything I did always had the exact same sound.  I tried changing the demo song to be more ambient, but everything I did still kept it in the realm of techno.  Ya know, the whole "unce unce unce" feel.</p><p>Techno is just fine.  Personally, I had a hard time getting away from the demo song (again, I'm a novice), but other people have made some pretty fun songs.</p><p>Such as Jetdaisuke's Express #471:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vty4pMfJkZ4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vty4pMfJkZ4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"> </embed></object></p><p>Also, the Demo videos on youtube are pretty good too:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bQcp2Mkt_-A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bQcp2Mkt_-A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>It's kinda simple...</b></div><p>Many of the other songs I came across all follow this style of music, but I want something ambient, progressive, and maybe a little trance, which is the style of Electronica I adore.  Or at least something more complex.</p><p>The third demo video gets closer to this:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vmIwZDVJSwI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vmIwZDVJSwI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>But, as the video demonstrates, it requires more than the 2 synths and 4 drums on the single Korg DS-10 cart.  You can cluster up to 4 Nintendo DSes and Korg DS-10s for a total of 8 synths and 16 drums, but that's a bit much to spend.  (Especially in Japan where Korg DS-10 was only available through Amazon.co.jp and cost $50 each).</p><div class='title'><b>Korg DS-10 Plus</b></div><p>A year after Korg DS-10 was released in Japan, AGI released Korg DS-10 Plus, which made use out of the recently released Nintendo DSi.  You could still get the same functionality from DS-10 Plus if you used it on a DS, but with the DSi, you effectively doubled your processing power and functionality.</p><p>With the DSi, Korg DS-10 Plus has 4 synths, and 8 drums.  Plus, you can edit your composition while playing in Song mode, which you couldn't do previously.  Korg DS-10 Plus is like having two regular DS-10s in one.</p><p>This really branches the synthesizer into more complex songs with a single cart:</p><p>Such as Magomusume's Mago_004:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/crax4GSIgR0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/crax4GSIgR0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>And S_Ishimaru's Millenium:</p><p><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Lx4r1ro15eg&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Lx4r1ro15eg&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>February 16th!</b></div><p>Korg DS-10 Plus comes out in America in a mere two weeks!

It has all the functionality of the original, with twice the amount of functionality for DSi owners.</p><p>It's not a piano, but it's definitely something.  And it's the cheapest and most portable synthesizer you'll ever buy. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Electronic Music Events of Interest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-electronic-music-events-of-interest">Upcoming Electronic Music Events of Interest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

So far, it's been a pretty packed month..</p><p>Sept 30th // <b>Moby</b> @ Vic Theater, Chicago<br/>Oct 1st // <b>Moby</b> @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis (<a href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis" title="/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">write up / pics</a>)<br/>Oct 8th // <b>Armin Van Buuren</b> @ Epic, Minneapolis<br/>Oct 9th // <b>MC Chris</b> @ The Annex, Madison (<a href="/old/v7/mc-chris-the-annex-madison" title="/mc-chris-the-annex-madison">write up / pics</a>)<br/>Oct 9th // <b>Armin Van Buuren</b> @ Aragon, Chicago<br/>Oct 10th // <b>John Digweed</b> @ Visions, Chicago (<a href="/old/v7/john-digweed-visions-chicago" title="/john-digweed-visions-chicago">write up / pics</a>)</p><p>But that's really only been the tip of the iceberg.  After double checking forums and collecting some fliers, the storm of music is far from over.  November is bringing just as much talent to the Midwest as October.  Even locally to Madison, too!</p><p>Oct 16th // <b>DJ Three</b> @ The Casbah, Madison  &lt;--- whoo!<br/>Oct 17th // <b>ATB</b> @ Visions, Chicago<br/>Oct 24th // <b>James Zabiela</b> @ Visions, Chicago<br/>Oct 30th // <b>Tiesto</b> @ Epic, Minneapolis<br/>Oct 30th // <b>Sasha</b> &amp; <b>Hernan Catteneo</b> @ House of Blues, Chicago  &lt;--- whoo!<br/>Oct 31st // <b>Tiesto</b> @ Congress Theater, Chicago<br/>Nov 1st // <b>Tiesto</b> @ The Rave, Milwaukee  &lt;--- whoo!</p><p>Nov 6th // <b>Basement Jaxx</b> &amp; <b>Mstrkrft</b> @ Congress Theater, Chicago  &lt;--- whoo!<br/>Nov 14th // <b>Infected Mushroom</b> @ House of Blue, Chicago<br/>Nov 20th // <b>Deadmau5</b> @ Congress Theater, Chicago  &lt;--- whoo!<br/>Nov 20th // <b>Above &amp; Beyond</b> @ Epic, Minneapolis<br/>Nov 20th // <b>Dubfire</b> @ Sound-bar, Chicago<br/>Nov 21st // <b>Above &amp; Beyond</b> @ Visions, Chicago  &lt;--- whoo!<br/>Nov 24th // <b>David Guetta</b> @ Spin, Minneapolis<br/>Nov 27th // <b>Sharam</b> @ Sound-bar, Chicago<br/>Nov 28th // <b>Marco V</b> @ Visions, Chicago</p><p>Moby, Armin, Digweed, Sasha, Hernan and Tiesto bring a very strong October, but Basement Jaxx, Mstrkrft, Infected Mushroom, Deadmau5, Above &amp; Beyond, Dubfire, Sharam and Marco V show that November brings just as much talent and sound.  I was super surprised and excited for Moby, Sasha, and Digweed all in one month, but November is definitely out to prove something.</p><p>Why are all these DJs traveling through the Midwest during the fall rather than the rest of the year?  October and November so jam packed, I have to pick and choose the events I go to!  I would absolutely love to see Dubfire, but Deadmau5 is performing the exact same night.  Sharam is amazing, but it's thanksgiving weekend and I'm out of town.</p><p>There's more talent in these two months than all the other months out of the year.  Which means that after Thanksgiving, the clubs will be absolutely barren once more.  By that point, it'll be cold and snowy and I'll rather stay home than crash my car on a slick highway.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rocktober!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rocktober">Rocktober!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Many musical events are beginning to align themselves to make October 2009 one of the best months out of the entire year!  I must be inclined to label this coming October as the rocking-est Rocktober ever.  Though, Tim Shafer had already used that tagline to promote his upcoming game <a href="http://brutallegend.com" title="http://brutallegend.com">Brutal Legend</a>.</p><p>On with the events!</p><p><b>Thursday, October 1st</b> // Moby @ Myth, Minneapolis // <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60" title="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60">link</a><br/><b>Friday, October 9th</b> // Armin van Buuren @ Visions, Chicago<br/><b>Saturday October 10th</b> // John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago // <a href="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248">link</a><br/><b>Friday October 30th</b> // Sasha @ House of Blues, Chicago // <a href="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show">link</a><br/><b>Sunday November 1st</b> // Tiesto @ The Rave, Milwaukee</p><p>Sasha, Digweed AND Moby all in the same month!  Also, Armin and Tiesto.  I already wrote a little post about what <a href="/old/v7/moby-djing" title="/moby-djing">Moby means to me</a>, but Sasha...</p><div class='title'><b>I love Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090726_sasha/sasha.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090726_sasha/sasha.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090726_sasha/sasha.webp"  /></p><p>I was hoping that Sasha would stop by the Midwest this year. ^_^  He was here last year with John Digweed.  Also, he was touring solo for the release of Involver 2.  But he completely skipped the Midwest!  Involver 2 was pretty cool, though. ^_^</p><p>Now that I have an iPod, I've been reacquainting myself with the music I have loved so much.  And then using that to springboard into music I've missed over the more recent years.  2003 Sasha to 2007 Sasha, 2008 and 2009.  I've been listening to it so much that I had hoped I would see him live rather soon.  It's rather fitting that he would be here a week after my birthday. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check out the following sets..  These are some of my favorites:</p><p>August 4th, 2002 // Essential Mix, Sasha @ Manumission, Priviledge, Ibiza<br/>June 27th, 2003 // Sasha @ Glastonbury 2003<br/>October 19th, 2003 // Sasha &amp; James Zabiela for Annie Nightengale<br/>August 11th, 2007 // Essential Mix, Sasha @ Cream, Amnesia, Ibiza<br/>July 31st, 2008 // Sasha @ Cream, Amnesia, Ibiza</p><p>Even since my introduction to Sasha through Wipeout 3 and Global Underground, I've been hooked.  For the most part, I've gone out of my way to catch him whenever he's nearby.  Except for one or twice, when I didn't know he was nearby or I was too busy with things.  As such, this will be my 8th time seeing him live (6th time solo).</p><p>April 24th, 2002 // Sasha + Digweed, Delta Heavy Tour @ The Quest, Minneapolis // <a href="/pages/sasha.htm" title="/pages/sasha.htm">text</a> &lt;-- god, horribly written.<br/>July 5th, 2003 // Sasha @ The Quest, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-the-quest" title="/sasha-the-quest">pics</a><br/>March 13th, 2004 // Sasha @ Visions, Chicago // <a href="/old/v7/sasha" title="/sasha">text</a>, <a href="/old/v7/sasha-vision-chicago" title="/sasha-vision-chicago">pics</a><br/>June 17th, 2004 // Sasha, Involver Tour @ Sound Bar, Chicago // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago">pics</a><br/>October 26th, 2004 // Sasha @ Club Escape, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis">pics</a><br/>June 10th, 2005 // Sasha, Fundacion Tour @ Sound Bar, Chicago // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2">pics</a><br/>April 16th, 2008 // Sasha + Digweed, Spring Tour @ Epic, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">post</a> <a href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">pics</a></p><div class='title'><b>Digweed</b></div><p>I've seen Digweed a couple times, aside from the times listed above w/ Sasha.</p><p>August 24th, 2004 // John Digweed @ Club Escape, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis">pics</a><br/>March 9th, 2007 // John Digweed @ Myth, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">post</a> <a href="/old/v7/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">pics</a></p><p>I find it really amazing who their sound changes from when they DJ solo and when they DJ together.</p><div class='title'><b>Armin, Tiesto</b></div><p>Armin is pretty sweet, but Tiesto is a bit of joke.

| July 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Whether it be for inspiration, playfulness, or living the life, Moby returned to clubs last year as a DJ.  He's always been close to the dance scene.  In fact, in his earlier years, didn't he frequently DJ?  Wikipedia doesn't seem to think so, but I thought I heard something about that.</p><p>My fandom for Moby doesn't go way back to his beginning.  I started paying attention to his music when some of his tracks started showing up in compilations.  In 1999, he released Play which I liked.  I fell in love with 18 in 2002.  That Summer in 2002 was the first time I had a chance to see Moby live, but I blew it because I thought $50 was too expensive for tickets.  It's still somewhat expensive, but Paul Oakenfold was there too.  (Edit: Actually it was Summer 2001 for the Area One Tour)</p><p>I've been a fan every since.  I loved Hotel.  I listened to it everyday throughout the summer of 2005.  Up until that point, I had seen all my favorite musicians and groups live, but Moby was ever elusive.  He'd either not tour in the Midwest, or I'd hear about it after the fact.</p><p>To this day, Moby is still my favorite musician who I've not seen live.</p><div class='title'><b>DJing</b></div><p>But anyways, back to the point.  In 2008, Moby released an album entitled Last Night.  It was a correspondence to all his memories DJing the previous several months.  It was a very chill but upbeat album.  It was great to flip on and lounge to. ^_^</p><p>So when he started touring a little more extensively as a DJ last year, I really wondered what his live sets would actually sound like.  On August 2nd, 2008, I had my chance.  It was my chance to not only see Moby live for the first time, but to listen to him DJ!  I was pretty excited.</p><p>However, those plans were dashed by a prior engagement (literally).  It was the same date as my good friend Erika's wedding, of which I was part of.  Even though Moby was a mere 2 hours away in downtown Chicago, it was not my fate.  That night, I did not belong in Moby's audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Wait for Me</b></div><p>A couple of weeks ago, Moby released his newest album, <b>Wait for me</b>.  Unfortunately, I don't really like it.  Play, 18, Hotel, Last Night all had a playful inspired energy.  Wait for me is a pretty depressive anti-war album that really doesn't appeal to me.</p><p>But, with Wait for Me, Moby is back into song writing and playing music rather than DJing.  He's become pretty political over the past year which has taken him out of the clubs and into the studio.  So, my chance to see him DJ has passed for now.</p><p>That is...  until yesterday.</p><div class='title'><b>Essential Mix</b></div><p>Thank god for Radio 1 and Pete Tong.  During the Ultra Music Festival last year, they recorded Moby's set on stage with Carl Cox.  After coming across a torrent from this set, I quickly downloaded it and had the pleasure of listening to it today on the bus!</p><p>Moby's Essential Mix set is pretty interesting.  It's incredibly high energy.  I knew that there was no way he'd play anything but House music, but I thought it would be a little more progressive and ambient given his album background.  If you had me listen to this set and afterward told me this was Moby, I would be shocked.</p><p>But there could be two major factors in play here.</p><p>1) This is the Ultra Music Festival.  DJs don't fuck around when it comes to Miami in Spring.  They bring their A game to the table, and cater to the 10,000 music lovers hopping around in the tent.  The music feeds off the crowd just as the crowd feeds off the music.  It's wildly intense, so it stands to reason that if he were playing House music, it would be incredibly energetic.</p><p>2) He's playing on stage with Carl Cox.  Carl Cox is known for incredibly energetic sets.  With Moby's set leading into Carl Cox, Moby has to bring the energy up to the level of Carl Cox.  So there's a little of that too.</p><p>I was super happy that the 3 or 4 ending tracks were all remixes of previous Moby songs. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>A True Moby set?</b></div><p>But, I have to ask myself, "Is this a true Moby set? When Moby DJs, is this really his sound?"  I'm not entirely convinced.  Again, it would've been nice to see him in Chicago last year to have some context, but that's not fair to Erika to complain about it.</p><p>The DVD packaged with 18: The B-sides, has Moby's entire live performance at Glastonbury 2003. This performance is exactly what I would picture Moby live.  It's a pretty mellow and vibrant performance.  This is the kind of rich ambient energy I was expecting from his DJ set.  It's really weird...</p><div class='title'><b>Finally!!</b></div><p>The day has finally come!!  These past ten years of listening to Moby, striving to hear him live, will finally come to light.  On September 30th, Moby will be touring through Chicago for "Wait for Me" which is pretty awesome.</p><p>But!  He'll be @ Myth, Minneapolis the day after on Thursday October 1st.  I think it's finally time to scratch off one of my life goals.  And it probably won't be anything like how I expect it to be. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hybrid I Choose Noise" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hybrid-i-choose-noise">Hybrid I Choose Noise</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 24, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>10 years ago, the electronic music group Hybrid released their first studio album, <b>Wide Angle</b>.  Wide Angle had an unprecedented sound that brought a cinematic quality to electronica.  The album carried the tone and flow of an epic experience and ended with one of their most celebrated tracks of all time: Finished Symphony.</p><p>Wide Angle definitely set a trend among producers and music makers, who begin adding a little cinematic flair to some of their music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp"  /></p><p>In 2003, Hybrid took a slightly different musical approach with their second album, <b>Morning Sci Fi</b>.  They added a base guitarist, and lead guitarist/singer.  They tried to distance themselves from their electronica roots and bring a more diversified set of sounds to their music.  Morning Sci Fi definitely still kept many of the cinematic tones they established in Wide Angle.  But they definitely led their songs heavy on the Guitar.</p><p>I actually saw them when the toured for Morning Sci Fi!  Man, I was so happy.  On November 14th, 2003, I completed one of my life goals at the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis: <a href="/old/v7/hybrid" title="/hybrid">Photos!</a> My friend at the time, Stu, got his synth signed, and I got some Vinyl Mats signed!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp"  /></p><p>It doesn't have Chris Healings signature, though :/</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after that I became too busy finishing school, working, going to Japan, and being depressed after Japan that I missed out on their third album...  until now!</p><div class='title'><b>I Choose Noise</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp"  /></p><p>In Late 2006, Hybrid released their third studio album, I Choose Noise.  It fetches a pretty high price on the Internet, actually.  Prices on <a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ55368631QQcpidZ1376705458" title="http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ55368631QQcpidZ1376705458">Half.com</a> are in the $125 range for new, $77 range for very good used.  Which is ridiculous!  Of course, who buys CDs these days, right?  You can download the entire album from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Choose-Noise/dp/B000S9FQNO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1245879554&amp;sr=8-2" title="http://www.amazon.com/I-Choose-Noise/dp/B000S9FQNO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1245879554&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon</a> for a mere $9.  Screw those annoying collectors.</p><p><b>I Choose Noise</b> leaves the band behind from Morning Sci Fi and continues the electronic cinematic experience.  It feels like a true sequel to Wide Angle, but still learns from the sharp crisp sounds in Morning Sci Fi.  It brings both techniques together to form an absolute masterpiece.  It feels really odd that I skipped over this album for the past 3 years.</p><p>I know I'm a little late to the party of this one, but definitely check out I Choose Noise.  Also, check out their previous two albums if you missed 'em.  I Love Hybrid. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming Album #4</b></div><p>After touring for I Choose Noise, Hybrid has been working on their next album.  They blogged about it last month on <a href="http://www.distinctiverecords.com/news_150509.html" title="http://www.distinctiverecords.com/news_150509.html">Distictive's website</a>.  Seems like what they original had last year didn't sit well with them.</p><p>But it sounds like they're back on track with something fantastic that should starting seeing the light of day around October 2009.  Here's hoping!</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update</span>: How embarrassing, I totally spelled Hybrid incorrectly in the title.  It's fixed now.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha &amp; Involver 2 further thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-involver-2-further-thoughts">Sasha &amp; Involver 2 further thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, I picked up Involver 2 without giving it much thought.  I found it at the first place I went to!  But after researching it a little bit, it seems they released a Limited Edition version.  I'm not quite sure why I didn't realize this since nearly every Global Underground release has a Limited Edition.  Buying it from Amazon was quite easy.  They had plenty.</p><p>Besides the nifty packaging, it also included a second CD with extra tracks and remixes, so that was reason enough to make the purchase.</p><p>Over the weekend, I went out to Milwaukee with Dave and hung out with Matt and Dan.  I popped Involver 2 into Dave's car and we listened to it quite a bit.  It's interesting how the CD takes a completely different form when the bass is the prominent sound.  Not saying that Dave has the most kickass sound system, but the Bass really takes on a melody of its own.</p><p>Man...  It really puts me in the mood to see him live again.  Or Digweed for that matter.  Digweed is a virtuoso of progressive pounding Bass.</p><p>Luckily, <b>Sasha has a free mix on his <a href="http://djsasha.com/fr.php" title="http://djsasha.com/fr.php">website</a>, which you can download directly from <a href="http://www.djsasha.com/Thank_You_Mix_2008.zip" title="http://www.djsasha.com/Thank_You_Mix_2008.zip">here</a></b>.  It's his "Thanks" to his fans.  It's amazing how very very Digweed this mix sounds.  I wonder if his Sasha+Digweed reunion tour earlier this year really inspired him to pull into a deep progressive direction.</p><p>Like every new piece of music, I listen to it over and over again at work until I get sick of it.  I think I listened to it 3 times today...</p><p>When I returned from Milwaukee, I came to find that I had received my LE copy of Involver 2.  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2028.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2028.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2028.webp" /></p><p>It comes in a nifty little pamphlet.  It's a little different than the first Involver LE which came in a pillow-pack.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2029.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2029.webp" /></p><p>The second disc of Involver 2 is neat, but quite unloved.  The care and attention that was put into the album as a whole was lost on this extras disc, but I guess that's to be expected.  Each song is very chill, even compared to the opening of Involver 2.  I only listened to it once though.  It didn't hold my attention the same way the actual Involver 2 does.</p><p>I'm excited again for Sasha after hearing his recent stuff.  During his Fundacion phase, I was starting to feel unmoved by his music.  I was starting to wait for what he had next, rather than not wanting it to end.  In fact, I missed him once or twice as he passed through the midwest and really didn't care.  But now I can't wait for him to get back here.  Hell, if he's in or around Tampa, I'd go visit Justin and make him bring me there. ^_^</p><p>Good Stuff.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/music/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/music">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
