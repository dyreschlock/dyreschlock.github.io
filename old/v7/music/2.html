| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Popularity for DJs soured in 2011.  DJs of all genres and tastes are in high demand, and the promoters of Chicago worked their asses off all year round.</p><p>And with the massive success of the North Coast Music Festival in 2010, promotion company React opened up their own night club, The Mid.  The Mid saw an unprecedented amount of talent week after week after week.</p><p>Through the year, the following events were my favorites, and almost all of my favorite tracks of the year ended up on the turntables at them one way or another.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Kings of Progressive House</b></div><p>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo @ Sound-Bar, Chicago // December 16th<br/>Sasha @ The Mid, Chicago // March 12th<br/>John Digweed @ The Mid, Chicago // March 23rd</p><p>All 4 of the best in Progressive House visited Chicago throughout the year.  John Digweed and Hernan Cattaneo stopped by twice!  All of these guys are my favorite DJs, and having the chance to see them all live in a single year absolutely blows my mind.</p><p>But out these nights, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo was the clear Event of the Year for me.  After trying to see Nick live for the past 8 years, the top person on my music bucket list was finally crossed off.  They spun for over 4 hours, and fed off of each other the whole time.  Nick was create some massive builds, and Hernan continued the plateau of that build into his couple of tracks.  Back and forth, back and forth, it was absolutely brilliant.  Here's my words about it from the day after: <a href="/old/v7/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago" title="/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago">December 18th</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>Sasha's set from March was unlike anything I'd heard from him lately.  He had been building up his Never say Never vibe which was mostly Tech House, and Indie tracks.  It was a very light, glowing, and joyful sound from him.  By his March set from The Mid pulled him back into the pure darkness.  It was a dark set filled with Progressive House and Techno.  It completely blind sided me, and carried the rich atmosphere that made me a Sasha fan in the first place.</p><p>Digweed's set from March felt like a showcase of all the talent he would later release in the year.  It was right in the middle of WMC, and it felt like he was road testing a whole lot of tracks for the upcoming weekend.  Among them was my favorite track of the year, Meridian, and many other beautiful and banging tracks.  It was on a Wednesday as well, so the vibe wasn't really as crazy as the weekend, either.</p><p>I kind of wish I would've went down there for Digweed's follow up set in May, but I was busy in Madison that weekend.  Having him on a proper weekend date would have been special. :)</p><div class='title'><b>2. North Coast Music Festival</b></div><p>Carl Cox, James Zabiela, Ida Engberg, Steve Bug</p><p>With PAX scheduled one weekend before Labor Day, I had all weekend to take in Chicago's massive Electronic Dance Music festival.  And I wrote a detailed diary of everything I did that weekend.</p><p>Day 1 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-1" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-1">Friday September 2nd</a><br/>Day 2 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">Saturday September 3rd</a><br/>Day 3 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-3" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-3">Sunday September 4th</a></p><p>While it was heavy with mainstream acts, North Coast had so much going on at anyone time, there was something for everyone.  Many of the acts that I attended were refreshing and classic compared to the many Electro House, and Dubstep acts of today.</p><p>James Zabiela spun and scratched some amazing breaky tracks on Friday.  It had been so long since I have heard any breakbeats live, I had almost forgot what they sounded like.  His set at the festival was only a taste of the mayhem he brought to Sound Bar that evening.  He mixed breaks into some amazing progressive house tracks.  It was fantastic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>Carl Cox blew my mind the next day as he performed a massive genre bending set that ripped into the crowd around his stage.  He spun Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz towards the beginning of his set, absolutely ruined the crowd, and kept up that energy and electricity throughout the rest of his set.  It was incredible.</p><p>For an after party, Five and I went to see Andy Moor at Vision.  While not a sanctioned North Coast after party, it was another highlight on my weekend.  It was great to hear harmonizing hard trance that didn't feel too generic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp"  /></p><p>At the end of Sunday, I went to Transit for a night of that classic House sound I grew up hearing in Minneapolis.  Steve Bug played a solid smooth House set, and Ida Engberg pumped up the energy with her brand of Techno.</p><p>It was a fantastic (and beautiful) weekend, and one of the best of the best of the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>3. M83 @ First Avenue, Minneapolis // November 16th</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp"  /></p><p>On a Wednesday in November, I drove up to Minneapolis and finally had the chance to see M83, one of my favorite bands.  I am a huge fan of their songs Teen Angst, Couluers, and their new lead single Midnight City.  The event was part of their tour for their new double length album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.</p><p>And seeing them live for the first (real) time was a dream.  They played all of their amazing hits from the new album, and all of their amazing hits from their previous album, Saturday = Youth, and plenty of amazing tracks from their past.  Hearing Teen Angst live and Couleurs live had been a dream of mine for a while, and it was another moment of crossing things off my music bucket list.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp"  /></p><p>As soon as they started playing Midnight City, all of First Ave was hopping up in the air, and tearing the roof off of the place.  It was tremendous, and a true show of how everyone there was feeling the exact same vibe.  From hipsters to business men, from moms to teens, from loving couples to singles, everyone embraced in the love pounding from the stage.  It was absolutely one of the best moments of the year.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Twisted in Madison</b></div><p>Shpongle @ The Majestic, Madison // April 26th<br/>Ott @ The Majestic, Madison // March 18th</p><p>My favorite psychedelic artists were on tour in 2011, and both of them made their way to Madison for two very special nights.  Twisted is the record label both them are a part of, though I think Ott may have split from them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp"  /></p><p>Ott was fresh off releasing a new album, Mir, with the beautiful and surreal track Adrift in Hilbert Space.  He had been to Madison the year before, but his 2011 experience showed a more enthusiastic and motivated Ott.  He was no longer just performing the same songs he already had.  His new album invigorated him, and that energy passed on to the crowd.</p><p>The whole night was a journey into his unique sound, and it was fantastic being there with like minded fans from the area.</p><p>The same thing happened again one month later with Shpongle, aka Simon Posford, label boss of the Twisted label.  Simon took us through a journey of Shpongle's greatest hits mixed in with several tracks from other artists on the Twisted label.  He was DJing in Minneapolis the year before, but to hear him locally at the Majestic with so many other fans was truly special.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp"  /></p><p>The event was as music visual as it was aural.  Shpongle brought with him the Sphongletron, a unique stage setup the used LEDs, back projectors, and a power front projector that illuminated the Shpongle head on the front of the Sphongletron.  The Shpongle light up during songs, and the lighting moved around the head to give the impression of a physical moving light.  And then!  The head started to move!  The head opened up his mouth, and his tongue started licking around his face.  And then!  The head began to twist and turn along with the trippy music.  At first, I had no idea what was going on.  It looked like the physical statue was moving and contorting on its own.  It was amazing and mesmerizing.</p><p>It was a night as unique as their respective sounds, and fantastic to seem them just down the street from where I lived. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Tracks" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-1-tracks">Favorite Music of 2011 - Tracks</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2011 was probably the best year for music for me.  With Electronic Dance Music's popularity at an all time high, the genre has gotten a large amount of attention, and DJs and artists have been working non-stop at getting their names out there, and promoters have been going over the top all year round to bring the world's greatest talent to their city.</p><p>There has been some amazing new music, mixed in with fantastic local talent and events.  Over the course of 2011, I've seen almost all of my favorite DJs and heard fantastic new music, and plenty of oldies as well, and they have opened my ears to some fantastic talent and music that made the perfect soundtrack to 2011.</p><p>Here are my favorite I heard throughout the year.  Almost all of them I was introduced to in a live setting, or later heard them live.</p><p class='img'><b>1. Guy J &amp; Henry Saiz - Meridian</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU</a></p><p>This massive track debuted towards the end of the year, but had support from John Digweed since Spring.  As he shopped it around, he knew he was sitting on something big, and made it part of the 100th release on his record label, Bedrock.</p><p>It has beautiful atmosphere that continues to build and build with a unique electricity.</p><p class='img'><b>2. David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA</a></p><p>Another massive track that Sasha shopped around as part of his Never say Never residency at Ushuaia in Ibiza.  This distinct track always shone through the tracks he was mixing, and was the highlight of a several track build.  It has that perfect summer Tech House feel.</p><p class='img'><b>3. M83 - Midnight City</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE</a></p><p>From start to finish, Midnight City exudes energy.  It has this classic feel-good sound.  I can't help but smile whenever I hear it.  It's a perfect follow-up to many of M83's other amazing hits, like Teen Angst and Couleurs.</p><p>I saw them at First Ave in Minneapolis, and when they started playing this song, the entire club erupted in cheers, and jumping, and dancing, and smiles everywhere.</p><p class='img'><b>4. Nick Warren - Beunos Aires</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8</a></p><p>Another distinctive progressive track from the very best in Progressive House.  Beunos Aires has a very smooth undertone that hooked me the moment I heard it.  It guides the track, and them slams you with the melody.  It's a really hard banging track, but the light melody likes to disguise itself as something else.  It's interesting, and works together amazingly well.</p><p>When Nick Warren played this song in Chicago, it made my day.  It made my year.  Different one of my favorite moments I've experienced in Dance music. :)</p><p class='img'><b>5. Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA</a></p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, I would say this is my favorite purely hard track of the year.  When a DJ throws down this track, there's no way to ignore it.  It rips through the scene and everyone pays attention.

| February 5, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been almost 2 1/2 years since Above &amp; Beyond performed in Minneapolis.  As they took the stage, right before midnight on Saturday, their gigantic LED display started off by saying, "Minneapolis, it's been too long."</p><p>Currently, on tour for their new artist album, <b>Group Therapy</b>, Above &amp; Beyond have visited a lot of lesser known clubs.  I think they intend to have another North American tour later in the year to all the American clubbing hot spots.  They've completely skipped over New York and Florida.  And have found themselves in Indiana, Ann Arbor, St. Louis, and plenty of Canadian areas too.</p><p>I was there in November 2009 when they took the stage and completely reopened my dormant thoughts about the good 'ol days of Trance.  All of their tracks were beautiful, melodic, and completely uplifting.  I was smiling all night.  <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Read all about it!</a></p><p>Last night was a little different though :/</p><p>A lot has changed in Electronic Dance Music over the past 2 years.  Electro House and Dubstep (and other) producers and DJs have brought the music genre into the mainstream, and popularity is currently at a ridiculous high.  Above &amp; Beyond have continued to capture the attention of old fans while still raking in new ones.  Which made for quite a crowded site.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp"  /></p><p>I've seen Epic (or The Quest) more crowded than it was last night, and still had a fantastic time.  But the crowd was a different beast than what I expect from Minneapolis.  Almost every time I've attended a DJ event in Minneapolis, the crowd is friendly.  They'll give you space, smile at you when you're dancing around, and be quite courteous and mindful of others.</p><p>Kids these days...  It's all pushing and shoving, and crowding out others while making more space for yourself.  Or maybe it's because it feels like the true fans of Minneapolis are STARVED for the type of music that pioneered the scene in the first place.  Now, if a remotely decent international DJ finally makes their back way to Minneapolis, every one remoted interested shows up, nerd or not.  Not to mention the #5 DJ Act in the world, Above &amp; Beyond.</p><p>I expect this kind of behavior from the crowds in Chicago, but Minneapolis?  And at a Trance show?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp"  /></p><p>Crowd mentality wasn't the only that has changed since the last time.</p><p>In order to stay relevant, Above &amp; Beyond have adapted to the changes in the EDM landscape with their own sound.  They have somewhat shifted away from the uplifting melodic sounds that blew me away 2 1/2 years ago, to more mainstream modern day trance, ala Armin van Buuren.  Their huge single last year, Sun &amp; Moon, is a perfect example of keeping some hints of melody while totally succuming to hard Trance beats.</p><p>I was very very hopeful, when they began their set with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c">Above &amp; Beyond - Filmic</a>, which is a beautiful track, but it turned into modern trance shortly after.  I was keeping track of everything they played, but it was pretty damn close to the Data Trasmission Podcast ep 200, and their Essential Mix last year.</p><p>Actually, one thing about those two mixes that I found absent in their set last night was the addition of some breaky tracks, or, at least, some breaky soundy tracks.  While the mixes were still modern day trance, it was refreshing to hear some of that mixed into it.  I don't recall hearing any of that last night.</p><p>Blah blah blah, complain complain complain... If I had picked up their new CD and listened to it a little more, I would have certainly been more prepared for modern day Above &amp; Beyond.  They should get Ocean Lab back together and make a follow up to Sirens of the Sea!</p><p>They did play On a Good (Metropolis) Day. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp"  /></p><p>I went up to Minneapolis with Fishy and Five.  Five had a great time.  He's more into the modern day Trance sound than I am, so he was absolutely in heaven the whole time.  Fishy was hopping around with her glue sticks (when we actually had a room), and attracted random people here and there.  Also, I was able to meet up with a childhood friend of mine, so the night turned out pretty great. :)</p><p>Once the night finished, Above &amp; Beyond exited the stage and raced back to the merch booth.  They blew right past Five as Jack Trash announced they're signing stuff at the merch booth.  Five turned around and was first in line for signed shit!  So, he picked up a $4 tour poster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp"  /></p><p>Only Paavo and Tony were signing things, though.  The third member, Jono, was not back there.  Actually, I never saw Jono on stage either.  Maybe he was waiting in the bus, or something.</p><p>Also, if you noticed the tour dates on that schedule, Minneapolis was the last stop on a 12-day concert binge for them.  Today was their first day off since last Tuesday.  And these 12 dates are almost the entire tour.  That's pretty crazy.  Though, I suppose if you have 3 members and only 2 of them are up on stage doing the work, it's not so bad.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/reuben-wu-of-ladytron-segredo-madison">Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They have negotiated a monthly (?) residency with Chicago local Dani Deahl, and they were able to get Reuben Wu from one of my favorite bands, Ladytron.  Rather than rescheduling, they just decided to role with it and have them both perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp"  /></p><p>Opening up for them were locals DJ Nick Nice and Mike Carlson.  Mike Carlson played a rather ridiculous set.  I think he fit almost every popular electronic dance genre into his set.  House, Techno, Electro, Electro House, Dubstep, Trance, and a little Acid House.  I (my phone) caught a couple of the tracks.</p><p>Steve Angello - Knas<br/>Freestylers - Cracks (Flux Pavilion Remix)<br/>Wolfgang - Illmerica<br/>Knife Party - Internet Friends<br/>Deadmau5 - Some Chords (i think?)</p><p>I though everything actually worked out quite well. Â Despite spanning all these genres, the whole set was pretty cohesive, and made sense.  It was rather interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dani Deahl</b></div><p>Dani Deahl took over a little bit before midnight.  She seems to have a lot of fans around the Midwest, and doesn't mind traveling up to Wisconsin to plays shows in Madison, or Milwaukee.  I've seen her before, opening up for JFK at The Mid.  That opening set was ok.  It didn't really seem like she was having much fun.  She was holding back.  She had to hold back, being a warm-up DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp"  /></p><p>Last night, she was able to completely let loose, and her set was fun for the most part.  She threw in several popular songs, but had an array of a few deeper tracks that really ripped up the crowd.  Here's some tracks I caught:</p><p>Calvin Harris - Awooga<br/>that Steve Aoki song<br/>iPhone marimba tone<br/>Swedish House Mafia - One</p><p>About halfway through her set, when she played that Steve Aoki song, I think things startedÂ deterioratingÂ for me.  And then she started throwing in more dubstep, and some ridiculous songs choices, like that track with an iPhone marimba tone drop?  What's the purpose of that song?  There's no musical reason for it what so ever.  Is the crowd supposed to laugh and say, "hurrr, it's that sound my phone makes"?  I hate dubstep (brostep).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Reuben Wu</b></div><p>Reuben Wu started around 1, and begin putting Dani's set to shame.  I feel like he started off a little dry, but after a few quick songs he tore into the crowd with a much harder edge.  I recorded the first half hour of his set.  I think it starts getting pretty damn good at the 14 minute mark.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o</a></p><p>I'm not really sure what genre this would be.  It's kinda of a mix of Electro House and Techno, I think.  I'm glad I recorded it because as the night (and drinking) progressed, my memory becomes less effective.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp"  /></p><p>It always interesting to see members of the band spin shit on their own.  I wonder imagine they play music they enjoy and draw some inspiration from.  I don't think Reuben threw in popular tracks to get people to like him.  I think he was a building a set he enjoyed and made sense.</p><p>Also, there was a decent crowd for Dani Deahl as she was throwing down tracks, but after Reuben took the stage, people started to slowly exit the club.  By the end, I think Segredo went from 400+ people down to 100. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Mira Aroyo @ The Rave last year</b></div><p>Apparently, all the members of Ladytron met in clubs in London while DJing back in the day, so I was always interested to hear what that might have sounded like.  Last year in Milwaukee, Mira Aroyo, one of the lead singers, was in Wisconsin as well.</p><p>It was a very odd night.  The Rave shacked her up in one of the side rooms, rather than either main room.  Only 50-70 people showed up throughout the night.  Most of those people were probably friends with the opening DJs.  (and) Beers were stupid expensive because it's The Rave, and that place is garbage.</p><p>Mira's mixing wasn't all that great, and her track selection wasn't very inspired.  She'd play a couple tracks, and then pick a remix of a Ladytron song. Play a few more tracks, then Ladytron remix again.  And the other tracks she played were either Electro, or Electro House, or Dubstep.  Mostly popular stuff.  It wasn't very cohesive, and she failed to build any kind of vibe.  The 70ish people there never really danced, so it was just a bunch of people standing around.</p><p>It was pretty awkward to begin with, but the most awkward moment was when she ended her set.  The crowd applauded, but then DEAD silence.  Mira gave a "Thank you", people clapped again, and dead silence again.  It was the saddest DJ event I've ever been to.</p><p>I like Mira quite a bit though.  I think she's my favorite member of Ladytron.  But after last night, I think Reuben is now my (secret) favorite.  Mira's set was pretty shallow.  And Reuben definitely proved he knows how to take command of the decks.  I'd be real interested to hear Helen and Daniel spin a set, but I doubt I'll ever have a chance to see that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago">Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He has had a residency at Ushuaia Beach Hotel, and hosting an event called "Never say Never."  As he puts it, this is chance for him to play any music he wants.  No expectations, no reservations.  Just spin all the tracks that give him inspiration from artists he loves and admires.</p><p>As such, the style of music is a bit different than his semi-typical Progressive House tone.  It's more light, semi-upbeat and rich Tech House.  But the feel is still Sasha.  The first time I heard a Never say Never, it was really odd.

Out of all the times I've Sasha over the last 10 years, i have NEVER seen his as energetic, on having as much fun, or generally happy to spin his tracks.  He was moving around in the booth all night, shaking hands with the happy people up front, and even gave out his headphones at the end of the night.  (He got them back, though, after he went up for 2 encores.)</p><p>Every other time I've seen him spin, he seems so into the vibe, and stoic that it's hard to tell if he's actually having fun.  Digweed is somewhat similar too.  They stand there the whole night, and build and build, layer and layer.  Perhaps they're too much into the technical aspects of mixing and set building to actually have fun?  Or maybe Sasha feels like he's being pigeon holed into a specific genre, and mixing in other stuff won't work with what he's already built.</p><p>But he was having the time of his life in the booth this night, and it completely fed the crowd.  For being as crowded as it was, everyone had a smile across their face.  Lots of hand shaking, high fives, and hugs.  Sasha's good vibes energized everyone there.</p><p>It was very different than the (semi) normal douchebaggery crowd that tends to show up to a Chicago club.  Maybe the horrible weather scarred them away.  Or maybe because the crowd was 80% dude, there weren't any chicks around to bring out the douchebag clubber within.  Or it could be a combination that resulted in actual Sasha fans braving the weather, and filling the majority of the club.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and was holding my camera in the air the whole time to capture the audio.  All the video is up on youtube right now, with a bit of a tracklist.</p><p>Playlist //<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6</a></p><p>Chris Walsh<br/>0.

Two of the very best in Progressive House, Two of the my favorite DJs, Two of my idols, Two legends, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo made a stop at Sound-Bar in Chicago on their brief USA tour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p>I have been a fan of Nick Warren not too long after I started really getting into Sasha.  Much like Sasha, he's a huge proveyor of a layered, building sound, but adds his own rich ambient flair to the mix.  It was his mix for Global Underground #24 that hooked me for life, though I think his set from <a href="http://hybridized.org/sets/839" title="http://hybridized.org/sets/839">Tonic in 2004</a> illustrates the vibe from that time much better.  His ambient sounds builds a warm, comfortable atmosphere, that builds throughout the night into massive energy.</p><p>Nick Warren is one-half of Way out West with Jody Wisternoff.  Way out West is responsible for some of the best and influential acid house, trance, and progressive trance hits over the last 15 years.</p><p>Nick has two radio shows.  He flexs his ambient sound on Frisky Radio every 2 months for Sound Garden.  And he has another show on Delta FM which he does every 2 months, also.  He usually posts them on his soundcloud page, so give 'em a listen: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren" title="http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren">http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren</a></p><p>For Hernan Cattaneo, I became a fan of his more recently.  His deep progressive house doesn't always resonate with me, but his live sets build an immense vibe that is unforgettable.  I missed his solo performance earlier this year at The Mid, so I was grateful to get another chance to see him so soon. :)</p><p>With Sasha and Digweed, I consider the 4 of them, the kings of Progressive House.  All of them are good friends, and tend to spin together at events.  They usually all get together for the bedrock boat cruise during the Winter Music Conference in Miami.</p><div class='title'><b>Sound Bar</b></div><p>Sound Bar did a horrible job promoting this event.  I only knew about it from Nick Warren's facebook page back in October.  Sound Bar said nothing about the event at all.  The promotion company, React, said nothing either despite promoting events into February already.  It wasn't until 2 weeks ago, when the event finally showed up on Sound Bar's webpage, and THEN react actually started promoting it.  So many people didn't even know this was going on until it was too late.</p><p>Sound Bar usually has a line around the block for weekend events, and there were only 4 or 5 groups of people in front of us when Five and I showed up a little bit before 11pm.  DESPITE that it still took 25 minutes to get into the building.  The lines bottleneck at the hostesses inside the door looking up names on the RSVP list.  They usually take about 3-4 minutes per person, unless you're a VIP or whatever.  She couldn't find my name, for some reason &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Throughout the night, Five and I went to the bar for some drinks.  Later in the evening, when I went to get some water, one of the bartenders was just talking with his friends off to the side not paying attention to the bar.  The other bartender was looking around at people, but didn't actually wait on someone until after 10 seconds of eye contact.  When she finally saw me, she started getting drinks for people right in front of her instead.  It was so bad for Five earlier in the night, that he just went downstairs to the other bar.</p><div class='title'><b>Progressive House</b></div><p>But all that annoying nonsense didn't matter when Nick and Hernan took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp"  /></p><p>They started spinning around 11:30pm!  Five and I had only just arrived, and they were already up!  I don't think I've ever been to a club in Chicago were the headliners started before Midnight.  AND they continued on until the end of the night.  Over 4 hours of pure Progressive House madness.</p><p>Nick started off with a couple smooth opening pieces, and gave the decks over to Hernan who followed it up with a deep vibe.  They continued this trend through out the night.  Nick would played 3-5 songs, and Hernan would follow up with another 3-5 songs, and it would go back to Nick.</p><p>Nick seemed to be leading the night.  His miniture 20 minute sets would start off smooth and continue to build and build and build until the entire dance floor erupted in crazy cheers and dance.  He'd give the decks back to Hernan and he would keep the vibe at the top of the room with a follow up 20 minute set.  It was absolutely nuts how raw the night was.  It kept building and keeping the level high all night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>I'm not as familar with the tracks Hernan was spinning, but I definitely caught a bunch of Nick's tracks from recent sets of his.  My favorite moment of the night was Nick mixing his track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_qufBb32A" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_qufBb32A">Rumbletump</a> into his other track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8">Buenos Aires</a>.  My second favorite moment of the night was Hernan when he dropped <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU">Guy J &amp; Henry Saiz - Meridian</a>.</p><p><b>Edit!</b> I was wrong.  It was Eelke Kleijn's remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuPHok0FgMk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuPHok0FgMk">Water Games</a> being mixed into Buenos Aires.  Still my favorite moment of the night, though.  I love both those songs :)</p><p>I recorded the first 3 hours of the night, which can be found on youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>It was an incredible rare ocassion that two of the biggest names in Progressive House teamed up for a unique massive event.  The entire crowd continued to rock out hard all night, and had nothing but smiles on their faces.  I think this is the first event I've ever been to in Chicago, where (pretty much) every one was getting along, and being friendly for a change.  Though, I think the nerds were in great attendance, so there weren't a lot of girls around on the dance floor messing everything up.</p><p>This was definitely the highlight of the year for me, and definitely in the top 5 music experiences of my life.  It's up there with Sasha from 2003, Hybrid in 2004, Junkie XL is 2004, and The Chemical Brothers last year.</p><p>Plus I got my copy of Global Underground 24 signed!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phantogram-high-noon-madison">Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Phantogram is an American indie band with members Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel.  According to wikipedia, they formed in 2007, but I don't think anyone really heard of them until 2009.  And 2010 is really when they got their "big break", so to speak.</p><div class='title'><b>Eyelid Movies Tour</b></div><p>I was introduced to them last year, right as they started their first national tour for the release of their upcoming debut album, <b>Eyelid Movies</b>.  I saw them on the upcoming board for High Noon Saloon, and my brother, Bill, had mentioned that they were pretty good, and that I'd probably like them.  I listened to some of their songs, and definitely liked them indeed.</p><p>On my birthday last year was when they came into Madison, and my local record store, Strictly Discs, had them put on an intimate in-store performance limited to 50 people.  I got down there the moment they opened up, and made sure to secure my place in line.  Well, it turned out that not a lot of people had heard of this.  Or they weren't interested.  I came back around 3pm when they were actually performing, and was 1 out about 30 people who listened to their short 30 minute set.</p><p>It was pretty fantastic.  They have a very melodic tone that builds a very ambient atmosphere, followed with a drum beat that guides the melodic and chorus of songs.  It's relaxing, but still energetic.  It paints a picture in my mind, every time I hear their songs.</p><p>I recorded the whole performance, last year: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4" title="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4</a></p><p>After they finished, everyone met upstairs for a quick meet-and-greet.  They brought along Vinyl copies of their yet unreleased album.  So I bought one of those, and got it signed by Josh and Sarah.  Unfortunately, I missed their performance at The High Noon later on due to birthday drinking.</p><p>Birthday Drinking wasn't a problem this year, because they came into town one day after. And the concert was on a Monday night, so I wasn't about to get shit-faced on a work night.</p><div class='title'><b>Nightlife Tour</b></div><p>It had been a while since I heard anything about Phantogram.  I saw them on High Noon's upcoming list, and had wondered if they were going to perform anything new since last year.  All of the concerts I had heard leading up to last year, were the same 11 tracks from their album.</p><p>Once again, my brother Bill sent me a link for an upcoming mini-album titled <b>Nightlife</b>.  It had 6 songs, but it still gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard them.  Some songs were rather similar to their earlier stuff.  But others actually iterated on their style, went in a few different directions, but kept their sound in tact.  I really like <b>Turning into Stone</b>, which seems to channel Moby but keeps it in their own voice.</p><p>Last night, they performed at The High Noon Saloon to a sold out crowd.  Sold out! on a Monday night, even.  Phantogram's popularity is exploding right now.  Many critics have very high praise for <b>Nightlife</b>, and even publications such as Wired are even commenting on them.  It's kind of crazy.  I doubt it would be possible to do an intimate in-store performance with them as the place would be overrun.</p><p>Along with greater popularity and a greater crowd, their stage performance has expanded.  They hired a drummer, rather than using a drum looping kit, or whatever.  Using a live drummer really makes their sound POP even more than before.  <b>They are much better live now.</b> Before it just sounded the same.</p><p>They brought along a bunch of lazers and lights too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp"  /></p><p>The crowd at the High Noon was interesting.  There were plenty of girls, hipsters, and kids totally into the indie scene.  They probably follow pitchfork, who have been talking this band up.  Right in the front were a bunch of bros whom I wouldn't think would attend such a show.  In fact, they were the most into Phantogram out of the whole audience.  They were probably drunk, but their hands were in the air the whole time, and they were rockin' out.  They bought me beer, too. :)</p><p>I recorded some video, but I mostly took a bunch of pictures.  I think I took enough notes to identify their set list, too.</p><p>1. ???

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, Five and I went down to Chicago to check out Amon Tobin's tour of his new album ISAM.  His tour included a crazy 3D visualization stage setup designed specifically with his album in mind, and is still currently touring across North America.  From the youtube clips I've seen of the show, it looked pretty neat.</p><p>Here is the trailer for his tour: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI</a></p><p>While the trailer represents what you see on the stage, it has a bunch of audience reactions, which leads me to believe their intended audience is the older, married, family crowd.  These are the types of trailers you'd see for the Blue Man Group, or magicians, or some stupid movie.  The type of trailer that's designed to get those boring people out of their houses and day-to-day lives, and experience something different for a change.</p><p>I'm not sure if they aired that trailer on TV, but the crowd in the Congress Theater was a bit different than the usual EDM crowd I'd expect in Chicago.  Sure, there were plenty of kids who most likely listen to dubstep and electro on the weekends.  As well as the crowd you'd find in clubs on the weekends.  But, there were also those couples who might have seen a commercial, such as the trailer, and figured they could use a night out for a change.  While the normal crowd was pushing and shoving their way around, the married crowd were respectful and nice about how packed the place was.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Opening for Amon Tobin was <b>Emika</b>, who was the official tour opener.  I really don't remember much of her set at all.  We got there about 10 minutes before she finished.  But before Amon Tobin took the stage, they sandwiched in a local opener, <b>Lorn</b>.  Lorn is one half of local electronica group <b>Omega Clash</b>, whose other half is <b>adoptahighway</b>.  I've seen adoptahighway before, and he's pretty slick.  Lorn wasn't too bad either.  He performed a somewhat downtempo, slightly experimental, yet banging set.  It was perfect for keeping the mood solid, while keeping the energy low in anticipation for Amon.</p><p>Lorn finished close to 11pm, and it took a little while for Amon to get everything setup.  I think he finally started around 11:30pm.  The curtains pulled up, and revealed the gigantic geometry stage thingy.  For the most part, it served as a canvas for the visualizations being blasted onto it from the projector right behind Five and I.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp"  /></p><p>The stage presence was huge, and reflected and reacted to the music. Amon Tobin's set was basically playing his new album ISAM from start to finish, with a little improvisation between tracks, but it didn't seem like much.  I hadn't listened to the album ahead of time, but I dunno...  It didn't really speak to me at all.  It was experimental in nature, and didn't really have any groove to it.  Without a constant beat to frame the sounds, it didn't capture my interest.</p><p>After Amon finished ISAM, he exited his contraption, got up a stage, and took a bow.  And went back inside for an encore.  After his encore, he did the same thing, and came back for a second encore.  The style of his first encore was much more drum 'n bass than experimental, and his second encore was kinda in the middle of his two styles.  I'm guessing that his started off as drum 'n bass, and eventually moved into experimental later.</p><div class='title'><b>ISAM v. Shpongletron</b></div><p>Earlier in year, Fishy, Chaos and I saw Shpongle as he rolled in Madison on tour with his own crazy stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  It has wings on the side, and an eye on the top that were made out of LEDs and had several visualizations programmed into them.  In the center sat the Shpongle head.  It would illuminate itself, and the colors would change.  The light source on the head would change as well, which was somewhat trippy to think of how it was doing that.  But then it moved!  The head twisted and contorted.  It would stick its tongue out at you.  It was really interesting to see, mainly because I wasn't expecting that at all.  And there wasn't a projector around either, so I really wasn't sure how that was happening.</p><p>Here's video I took from that show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWf</a> at the 18 minute mark.</p><p>With Amon Tobin's ISAM stage setup, that suspension of disbelief was never there.  The huge projectors in the middle of the floor shone like a spotlight on the stage, and you could clearly see the geometry of the stage setup for what it was.  Plus, there were few times when the visualizations actually took advantage of the cubed nature of the structure.  And even then, you could clearly tell it was being painted on by the projector.</p><p>It really wasn't until Amon's second encore when the visualization reached the level I had experienced with the Shpongletron.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp"  /></p><p>It painted a bunch of stacked cubes on the structure, and they twisted, and collapsed several times.  It was subtle and fit with the design, so it looked believable (at least until they fell over).  The whole rest of the show was way too deliberate.  Some of it would have been better off using a giant LED display instead.</p><p>Overall, it was alright.  Amon Tobin is part of the Ninja Tune record label.  And while I'm a big fan of that label, I think I need to remind myself that their music is very hit-or-miss with me.  Some experimental really grooves and speaks to me, but I think I need to be in a certain mood to receive it properly.  Otherwise, it falls flat :/<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DJ Promos" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dj-promos">DJ Promos</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 14, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I've been a fan of the music for over a decade.  And I continue to listen to the music, both new and old, almost all day long.  I'm always finding some new tracks, or great new artists I hadn't heard of before.  The Internet continues to bring the world of music together, and people can easily display their works, get feedback, and evolve fast.</p><p>I go out to local clubs fairly regularly, and watch how the local talent evolves.  As well as make the trek to Minneapolis or Chicago to see some of the best DJs in the world evolve and shape the industry.</p><p>I have always had the fascination of DJing myself.  Back in the day, this was impossible for me.  At $10 a pop, records are not cheap.  Plus, I needed to buy all the equipment, and there was no guarantee I'd be any good at it.  Before DJs went digital, most local DJs either worked at, or spent all their free time in record stores.  They'd be exposed to all the new tracks, and have the equipment available to them on a daily basis.  I didn't have the knowledge, the skills, or the money to invest in doing any of that.</p><p>But in modern times all of that has changed.  All the record stores are online, and you can fit DAYS worth of music in your pocket.  Songs are a mere $1 or $2.  And the only equipment you need to start off with is a laptop with the correct software.  As time goes on, you'll probably pick up equipment to make it easier and more diverse. The best local DJs end up spending all their time on the computer, whether it be on the Internet, or playing around with tracks.</p><p>With that in mind, my friends finally convinced me to give it a go.  I already had collected a bunch of my favorite tracks I've heard over the years, and a whole bunch of new ones.  I downloaded Traktor, and started mixing them together.</p><div class='title'><b>Summertime!</b></div><p>One of my friends throws his annual bonfire party towards the end of summer, and he let me in charge of the music. Leading up to the party, I would collect a bunch of music during the day while listening at work.  When I got home, I'd download them, and mix them all together for the rest of the night.  Things sounded pretty decent.</p><p>I made a promo mix leading up to his party, so people would have an idea of the sound I was bringing.  Or after the party, people could have something to listen to.</p><p>So that's this mix...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 001.mp3</a></p><p>It includes many favorites that I can't get enough of. :)</p><p>1. Guy J - Heliscope<br/>2. Radiohead - Reckoner (Henry Saiz's Vocal Mantra Remix)<br/>3. Exoplanet - Shepherd of Consciousness (Moonbeam Remix)<br/>4. Booka Shade - Regenerate (Pan-Pot Remix)<br/>5. Denis A - Ocean (Monaque Remix)<br/>6. Christian Cambas - Fireball (Original Mix)<br/>7. Omid 16B - Rain<br/>8. John Digweed - Gridlock (Digweed &amp; Miur's Stereo Club Mix)<br/>9. Unkle - Heavy Drug (King Unique Smoke Nest Mix)<br/>10. Orbital - Halcyon + On + On (Aaron Static 2011 Bootleg)<br/>11. Rone - So So So</p><p>Though, it is heavy on the Bedrock artists: Guy J, Henry Saiz, Omid 16B, and John Digweed.  Which explains why many of the songs mix together as well as they do.  Orbital - Halcyon + On + On is one of my favorite songs, and Aaron Static's bootleg is an amazing cut of it.</p><p>Overall the party was quite a success.  Gage lent me his mixing board and speakers, so things sounded excellent.  I mixed tracks together for about 8 hours from mid-afternoon into the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>End of Summertime!</b></div><p>After the party, I was busy with a bunch of other things and didn't really get back to mixing more tracks.  I had another DJ mix lined up to record after the party, and I've heard some amazing music since then.  I wanted to make another one before I got the Internet restored in my apartment, and start downloading a whole lot of new tracks.  I wanted to capture some of arrangements I found while mixing stuff together for 8 hours.</p><p>After listening to what I had, a lot of it didn't really fit in a one hour time slot.  There really wasn't a good starting point and ending point to include what I wanted.  So, I basically cut it in half, and built up the first chunk with the following mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 002.mp3</a></p><p>1. Golan Globus - Blazer (Version 2)<br/>2. Pezzner - Almost Here Pt 3<br/>3. Caribou - Sun (Midland Re-Edit)<br/>4. Nick Warren - Buenos Aires<br/>5. King Unique - Sugarhigh (Dan Alcala Sweet Stuff Remix)<br/>6. Hybrid - I Know (Keenan &amp; Anderson Remix)<br/>7. Underworld - Two Months Off (Grayarea's Four Year Off Remix)<br/>8. Solarstatik - Waypoint<br/>9. Daft Punk - C.L.U. (Paul Oakenfold Remix)<br/>10. Radiohead - Everything in its Right Place (Oakenfold 2008 Remix)</p><p>I worked backwards piecing together some melodic sounds building up to the somewhat cheesy ending I started off with.  That Pezzner track mixes perfectly with Blazer, and Dan Alcala's Sugarhigh remix is probably the highlight of this set for me.  So smooth :)</p><p>This mix probably would have had a lot more Prog Trance if I had more sources of that type of music.  Trying to keep this mix diverse was hard which is why it turned out so melodic and smooth to start with.  I needed something leading up to Two Months Off, and I didn't want to start off dark.</p><p>But I'm happy with the result :)  I love listening to this kind of music while traveling.</p><div class='title'><b>Falltime</b></div><p>I have a selection of tracks picked out for my next mix, but I haven't arranged them in a cohesive way.  So it's possible I'll end up with something completely different than I intended, much like this last mix.</p><p>Good Times :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ladytron @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ladytron-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">Ladytron @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I listen to a lot of music.  While almost all of this music falls into electronica, and mostly dance and DJ music from there, I try to branch out a bit and find artists that sound different than the rest, or ones that sound totally amazing to me.  This is probably how most DJs cultivate and shape their careers.  At least the ones that actually grow and continue to be relevant, while others drown in the minutia of popular tracks from others.</p><p>I find some pretty amazing music, but end up moving on to the next thing after a while.  As such, I lose track of the artist.  And tend to forget about them, and not really notice if they create anything new, or how their career changes and sound evolves over time.  I never really understand them anymore than a single or few tracks from a particular moment in time.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>But there are a few musicians that I've kept track of over multiple years, and tend to shape my own opinion and taste in music.  One of these bands is <b>Ladytron</b>.  Ladytron has four members, Mira and Helen trade off singing vocals, while Daniel and Reuben are always on synths in the background.   I started listening to these guys towards the end of college in 2005 and 2006.</p><p>They've been around since 1999, and if I heard some of their tracks from the beginning, I probably would have shrugged them off and went on to something else.  In fact, who knows...  I probably did back in the day, and don't remember.  Most of their original songs were kinda emo and seemed to speak to teenage girls.  Their first two albums consisted of several songs dealing with boyfriends and modeling.</p><div class='title'><b>Witching Hour + Velocifero</b></div><p>Around the time I started listening to them, their sound had evolved.  Their third album, Witching Hour (2005), focused much more on the beat and progression of the songs, rather than the lyrics.  The lyrics served as flavor text to captivate the audience, while the beat hooks them in.  "High Rise", "Destroy Everything You Touch", "International Dateline", and "Fight in Built up areas" are all pretty bad ass.  I think <b>High Rise</b> might be my favorite song.</p><p>Velocifero (2008), their fourth album, continued with their more layered rocking atmosphere, but seemed to dial a little bit back, rather than push forward.  Ladytron went on tour in early 2009, which is when I saw them for the first time.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago" title="/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago">Ladytron @ Metro, Chicago // April 4th, 2009</a></p><p>After they finished up the tour, it seemed like they disappeared.  They didn't produce any new music.  They didn't go on tour.  They hardly did anything at all.  Apparently, there was rumor of them breaking up circulating last year.  I think Helen and Mira went off and worked on some new things of their own, while Daniel and Reuben worked on some new songs.</p><div class='title'><b>Gravity the Seducer</b></div><p>And then, early this year, it seemed like a flood of Ladytron news hit the Internet.  They had a brand new single, and an upcoming compilation album focusing on their first ten years, as well as a remix album.  In the middle of the year, they announced their fifth album, Gravity the Seducer, along with a tour promoting the CD!</p><p>While some of the songs on their new CD follow the same vein as Velocifero, Gravity the Seducer has several tracks that are much more ambient than anything they've done before.  It's somewhat odd because the two sounds don't really compliment each other.  <em>White Elephant</em>, <em>Ace of Hz</em>, and <em>Mirage</em> build up the album with their classic sound,  while <em>White Gold</em>, <em>Moon Palace</em>, <em>Altitude Blues</em> etc bring it to a different place.</p><p>I wonder if this inconsistency was born from their unofficial hiatus and rumored breakup.  Maybe Reuben and Daniel were working on this direction when Mira and Helen came back.</p><div class='title'><b>Tour in Minneapolis!</b></div><p>Anyway, last night!, their North American tour came through Minneapolis.  I rented a car, and met up with my little sister to see them live.  The Fine Line Music Cafe is a fantastic venue where I've seen some of my favorite concerts of all time, including Hybrid on <a href="/old/v7/hybrid" title="/hybrid">November 14th, 2003</a> and Moby on <a href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis" title="/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">October 5th, 2009</a>.</p><p>The place slowly filled up with fans, and the crowd was rather diverse and odd.  You had your typical hipster-like youth, and the slightly older alternative crowd.  There were also a couple of punkers there.  And the typical concert going music lovers, like myself.  In addition, there were several older patrons who I would not expect to find at the place.  One of these guys even talked with me at length at how he's such a fan of Ladytron, and how no one he knows has even heard of them before.  I wonder if this is how it'll be for me in 15 years.</p><p>Musician Sonoio was on opening duties, and he warmed up the crowd with his eclectic music.  I'm not really sure how to describe his music.  It was definitely experimental, but felt like it had a tinge of Japanoise thrown on top.  Not like over the top Japanoise, but a more mellow ambient rendition.  I dunno...  His music did not speak to me.  And the crowd swayed back and forth to his performance in anticipation of the main act.</p><p>Sonoio finished up, and started packing away his stuff.  Ladytron roadies took the stand, and performed sound checks.  One of the roadies pasted the set list to the floor...  Well...  Now I know exactly what they're going to play for the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp"  /></p><p>The set list is as follows:</p><p>1. <b>Soft Power</b> - Witching Hour<br/>2. <b>International Dateline</b> - Witching Hour<br/>3. <b>Mirage</b> - Gravity the Seducer<br/>4. <b>Ghosts</b> - Velocifero (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fTy8_fQJaI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fTy8_fQJaI">video</a>)<br/>5. <b>High Rise</b> - Witching Hour<br/>6. <b>True Mathematics</b> - Light &amp; Magic<br/>7. <b>White Gold</b> - Gravity the Seducer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfsI9qwiBis" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfsI9qwiBis">video</a>)<br/>8. <b>Runaway</b> - Velocifero<br/>9. <b>Ace of Hz</b> - Gravity the Seducer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5upN1DY6U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5upN1DY6U">video</a>)<br/>10. <b>Little Black Angel</b> - Best of 00-10<br/>11. <b>Discotraxx</b> - 604<br/>12. <b>Fighting in Built up Areas</b> - Witching Hour<br/>13. <b>Seventeen</b> - Light &amp; Magic</p><p>Encore:  (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l4a-gJXY8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l4a-gJXY8">video</a>)<br/>1. <b>White Elephant</b> - Gravity the Seducer<br/>2. <b>Destroy Everything You Touch</b> - Witching Hour</p><div class='title'><b>Performance</b></div><p>Ladytron were pretty damn awesome.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>They actually sounded much better than I've ever heard them live before.</p><p>In all of the live recordings on their albums, they always sounded a bit off.  The levels never matched the album versions of their songs.  The drums were either too loud, or not enough.  Some of the synths weren't harmonizing together.  It was a muted experience.  And that was reflected when I saw them in 2009.  It was the exact same sound as their live stuff.</p><p>But that wasn't the case this time.  Not only were all the levels at the perfect balance, and everything harmonized together, it was amplified ten fold and actually engulfed the audience in the atmosphere present from their fantastic songs of Witching Hour.  Also, I was right up from next to the speaker, so that helped too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp"  /></p><p>With the exception of Gravity the Seducer, I've listening to their other songs over and over again, so there weren't many surprises that came out of the night.  The whole audience kept in a constant groove as Ladytron went down their set list.  I kind of wish I hadn't seen that ahead of time.  &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Things did change when they hit "Fighting in Built up Areas."  That song really popped, and threw down a dancey beat.  Everyone was hopping around.  My little sister wasn't too impressed with the evening until they hit this beat.</p><p>Overall, I thought the concert was pretty fantastic.  These songs have never sounded as great as they did in The Fine Line.  Listening to their album version doesn't do the night justice.  I recorded a couple moments from the night, but I think "Fighting in Built up Areas", "High Rise", and "Little Black Angel" were the highlights for me.</p><p>Also!  My little sister and I got a poster of "White Elephants" signed by Mira, Helen, Reuben and Daniel.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp"  /></p><p>Score!<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/music/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/music">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
