He selected his favorite tracks, tore them completely apart and put them back together.  His work on Involver was much more than a simple remix.  It was really a reconstruction like a full-on production album.</p><p>Before reading about and catching up on Sasha, I didn't really feel like Invol2ver really lived up to the Involver name.  Some of the tracks felt very mute.  I didn't quite understand what the point was, or what these tracks meant.  The beginning just melted itself into something like Fundacion with little hints of Airdrawndagger.  The album did, eventually, pull itself into the Sasha Involver style.</p><p>For some reason, the little booklet didn't have any description or proof of concept like the first Involver.  But Global Underground had the description I was looking for.  And reminded me of what Sasha was up to lately.</p><div class='title'><b>Two Halves</b></div><p>The first half of Invol2ver is a diary of his emFire Collection.  It's very chill and nature.  The emFire collection is a soundtrack to a bunch of surfer videos.  But it eventually builds into his DJ experiences as of late.  The second half and ending brings me back to how I felt when I first heard Involver.  Very distinct melodies built off the underlying bass and movement.</p><p>Overall, I think Invol2ver accomplishes its goals, but the 2 different feelings of the emFire collection and his DJ experiences clash quite heavily.</p><p>For a mix album, it may have been better to have the Day and Night cycles on two separate discs, rather than mixing into each other.  It does form a story though.  Starting from daylight, at the beach, then watching the sun set on Miami, and then going to a club and dancing into the late night.</p><p>I guess that's why the 2 is smack dab in the middle of the title.  Invol2ver.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p>It's unfortunate that Sasha isn't touring in the midwest for his Invol2ver North American tour.  I'd really like to see what his set says about his CD release.  Though, I suppose for June 2004 it was very much in the style of Fundacion than Involver, so his North American might not say much of anything.</p><p>I saw him back in April 2008 for his Spring Tour with John Digweed, but I'm not sure when I saw Sasha before that.  His style has become very undistinct for me lately and June 2004 was the beginning.</p><p>The ending of Involver 1 really felt like this was the direction he was going.  The final song just trailed off into the distance.  But the ending of Invol2ver put a very distinct cap on the album.  I'd like to see if this means anything. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Protomen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-protomen">The Protomen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 22, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The more and more I listen to The Protomen's self-titled album, the more and more brilliance I find with it after each listen.</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics are crap</b></div><p>I'm a big believer that lyrics in music are complete crap and a waste of time.  Comedy is the only genre where lyrics are the focal point, but in other genres, the lyrics are basically there to mask the poor music performance going on behind the singer.  Lyrics give you a biased opinion of what the song is supposed to about, rather than having the song relay that message on its own.  You should be able to dip into the music like a pool of emotion and float along with everyone else.</p><p>This is why I hate nearly all music.  As a kid, I hated Pop and Rock..  I couldn't stand it.  It just sounded like a bunch of noise with no cohesion and poorly crafted lyrics that were inaudible.  Some of my friends started getting me into Electronica which built itself on repetition, layers and absolutely no lyrics in the way..  It was the first time I actually started listening to music, rather than just hearing it.</p><p>After understanding music a little more, lyrics are still pretty annoying, but work incredibly well with some songs.  Electronica is historically known for having the worst written lyrics, but they're always easier to learn.  Then you can add your own noise to the aural atmosphere.  You are right there with the singer and everyone else chanting the lyrics.  The lyrics are generally strategically placed in the song to build on the mood rather than tell you how to feel.</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics aren't that bad</b></div><p>The Protomen is a metal/garage rock opera.  It's a 38 minute story in 7 parts that <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen-frequency" title="/the-protomen-frequency">I wrote about before</a>.  It tells of Protoman's epic struggle and death, and Megaman's rise to follow in his footsteps and eventually confront him circa Megaman 3.</p><p>Each lyric is a sentence of the story that serves telling this story and flowing in harmony with the guitars, keyboards and drums.  The lyrics are another instrument in this symphony that is not more or less important than another.  I've rarely heard lyrics used this way before. ^_^  Maybe that's because the lyrics are telling a story with an overall emotion rather than constantly explaining that emotion.</p><p>Anywho.. Check them out if you get a chance.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Musical Weekend" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/musical-weekend">Musical Weekend</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 4, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Musical Weekend</p><p>This weekend, I happened to do a lot of music related activities.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathan Coulton @ Majestic</b></div><p>On Friday, Jonathan Coulton was in town and brought his pals Paul and Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" /></p><p>Paul and Storm were a decent opening act, but a lot of their humor feel short with me.  I thought the bulk out their comedy was a little too obvious and wasn't really as clever as Coulton's songwriting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" /></p><p>Coulton was absolutely hilarious though. ^_^  My favorite part of the night was totally his live rendition of Mr. Fancy Pants with his Midi Controller in which he rick roll'd several times.  I tried to find a YouTube of him doing it, but it appears he does that song differently each time.</p><p>Coulton was great, but the best part of the night was running into plenty of friends whom I thought would show up and some I didn't expect ^_^.  I went with Tony and Erika, and met up with Dan & Becky.  Stacie was there too; I hadn't seen her in a while.  One of my co-workers, Chris, got in at the last minute.  And Kyle Heins, too!  If this was slightly coordinated better, we could've hung out for a while, but oh well.  Tony, Erika, Dan & Becky and I went to a bar downtown for a while before heading home for the evening and that worked out great ^_^</p><p>Also, I probably could've taken better pictures, but I decided to hang out and listen to the music and my top priority of the evening instead.  Plus, the whole place was decked out with chairs.. how the hell are you supposed to get into the music when you're sitting on your ass!?  Oh well, these songs weren't really the dancing or rocking out variety.</p><div class='title'><b>Eccentric Beats 5 Year Anniversary</b></div><p>The next day, I took a greyhound up to Minneapolis to catch Eccentric Beats 5 year anniversary in 1st Ave's VIP room.  My little sister picked me up from the bus stop, we hung around for a bit, and went downtown with her friend Phil.</p><p>For their 5th Anniversary, Phil Good and the crew got <b>Phil K</b> to headline their event with a couple other people ahead of time.</p><div class='title'><b>Symmetry Jen & Ricky the Golden Child</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0868.webp" /></p><p>When we finally got inside, we were greeted with Jen and Ricky who were quite fun. ^_^  I don't exactly remember what genre they were spinning.  Breaky House, maybe?  I dunno...  I'm horrible with that side of the spectrum.</p><div class='title'><b>Leon J</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0873.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0873.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0873.webp" /></p><p>Before we knew it, Leon J got his turn on the decks and the night was absolute gold.  Leon J tore the tracks up and down and all over the place.  His energy kept the beat very strong and very hard minute after minute after minute.  My night was made, thanks to him.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0874.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0874.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0876.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0876.webp" /></p><p>He handed out a couple of CDs and I snatched one right away.  As his music filled the entire room, more and more people began to show up and the people began to fill in all the space the music occupied.  Everyone was up on their feet and moving around thanks to Leon J.  Leon's hour was over far too quick.</p><div class='title'><b>Phil K</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0883.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0883.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0883.webp" /></p><p>A little bit after midnight, Phil K arrived and took over.  He started with some smooth sounds and it felt pretty standard the whole night.  Maybe I don't have the ear I thought I did for his music, but Leon J stole the show, in my opinion.  Phil K's could not reach the energy level Leon already hit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was a fantastic night ^_^.  It was the first time I had ever been to 1st Ave, despite it being the oldest running venue in Minneapolis.  It was also the first time I got to bring my little sister along, so that was fun too.  Afterwards, she brought me to her bars down in Hopkins and we got to run around and be belligerent drunks and ruin people's Sunday mornings.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 80s Prom porn @ Inferno" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/80s-prom-porn-inferno">80s Prom porn @ Inferno</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 23, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, Brett and I went to the Inferno Club in Madison.  To date, there has only been one ocassion where I left the establishment satisfied, which was around two years ago when Richard Divine tore up the place (<a href="/old/v7/richard-divine-inferno" title="/richard-divine-inferno">here what i wrote</a>).  The other two times at Inferno had been a stark disappointment.  Extremely low turn-outs..</p><p>When arriving at Inferno around 9:45pm, it seemed like I was being setup for disappointment again.  There were maybe a dozen or two people there, most of which were sipping drinks at the bar.  There was one group that was quite into the scene and were on the dance floor.</p><p>Brett and I found a table off to the side and perched ourselves for the night.  Despite having few people around, the track selection was absolutely amazing.  80s dance hit after 80s dance hit.  Amazing song I never remember this well, to several great songs I had never heard before.</p><p>DJ Smitty was the resident all night long and he kep the hits coming along.  His track selection was top notch.  Unfortunately though, he didn't mix any tracks together at all.  When one song ended, it was a quick to the next.  It was like getting punched in the side or pushed into a wall at the end of every song.  ughh..</p><p>I never got used to his hard cuts, but what can you do really?  The genre is 'retro' which covers ALL genres of dance from the 80s and other eras.  Track mixing really didn't become all that prevalent until the 90s..  I would've liked some effort but towards mixing, but all these songs are so radically different, it would probably be disastrous if you weren't already a mixing god.  Oh well...</p><p>The track selection made the night perfect, and as the night went on..  more and more people did begin to show up and started flocking to the dance floor.  The power of delicious 80s tracks truly did bring people into the venue despite Spring Break and a Snow Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" /></p><p>This event was the highest viewed for the month of March on Inferno's website, so I really wonder what kind of crowds this'll draw when it's not Spring Break and the weather is fine.  80s Night at Inferno is the 3rd Friday of each month, so I guess we'll see next time on April 18th.</p><p>April 18th also happens to be No Brand Con, so I won't be able to get any SPAMM friends to go, but if you aren't going up to Eau Claire that weekend, feel free to stop by Madison, ^_^</p><p>Favorite Track of the Night: Ghostbusters Theme ^_^.  Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough for Smitty to play my request of the Beverly Hills Cop Theme.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-avalon-los-angeles-240606">Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The last I came across of sasha was back when his CD fundacion was released about 2 years ago.  I figured that he must've been up to something since then.</p><p>Well, he's not touring around, but he did release a CD between now and then.  That would be the title of this article, Sasha @ Avalon so on and so forth.  I wasn't that big a fan of fundacion but Airdrawndagger and Involver are two of my favorite CDs, so i'll give it a chance.</p><div class='title'><b>Limited Edition</b></div><p>No Luck, actually.  This CD is limited to a mere 10,000 copies, and when I searched for it on Amazon, Ebay and Half.com, the cheapest discs were going for $100.  I love Sasha, but with his current trend of music, there was no way I was going to put down that amount of cash for a CD.</p><p>Thank god for Google.  I checked to see where I could find this disc for the cheapest.  A couple places had it for $15 and $20.  Really?!  Oh wait, they're out of stock.  I continued to wade through these cheap out of stock copies, when I came across two sites that said they actually had it in stock..  walmart.com and Bull Moose audio.</p><p>No way.. they probably just forgot to update their inventories.  That didn't stop me though..  at $20 with a possibility of being in stock, why not just order it?  The least that could happen would be your order canceled and money returned.  So I went for it..  I ordered one copy from Walmart, and another from Bull Moose.</p><p>Success!  Both of my orders were processed, shipped, and received!</p><div class='title'><b>Presentation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" /></p><p>The packaging is pretty badass..

Very progressive compared to his previous styles of Involver and pre-Involver.  Sasha's motive for music is to build upon many different layers of sound, which he's been systematic putting into his style ever since learning Abelton Live and going completely digital.</p><p>I don't get his new style, though.  He builds tons of layers, but all the layers eventually blend into each other, with no defintion of melody or sound.  It all sounds the exact same to me and very stands out what-so-ever.  When I listen to his new style, I completely forget I'm even listening to the music.  Later on, I'll check the playlist and realize I've gone through 5 or 6 songs already..  sigh.</p><p>Avalon is quite similar to this style but does break away into melody and definition in a few spots.  The first disc has a couple tracks that are wonderful..  Unlike all the fundacion tracks, I actually start humming them thinking back to the cd. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't enough of these tracks that make me love this cd as a whole.  These tracks are quite soothing, but don't bring the painting into a full composition.</p><p>Not only that, but he suffers a train wreck in the first track of the second cd.  What the hell is up with that?  The only reason this cd is so expensive is because of its rarity..  This is definitely one to download, rather than purchase.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on each individual track:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" /></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/music/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
