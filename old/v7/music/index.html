| November 17, 2019 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My absolute favorite video game soundtrack of all time is from Chrono Cross. It was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and had the perfect blend of atmosphere, mystery, and comfort. It perfectly complemented the dreamy and whimsical world of Chrono Cross.</p><p>This year is the 20th Anniversary of Chrono Cross, and to celebrate Mitsuda has gotten his band together to give a live tour of the Chrono Cross soundtrack. It will be performed 5 times in 3 cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.  Tickets were not so cheap at 16800<span class='ja'>円</span> (equivalent to $168), but it would be an absolute dream to hear my favorite video game music performed by the actual creator of the music. Easy buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Morning of the Concert</b></div><p>Prior to the concert, I met up with someone from the Internet who was also attending. We had our tickets reserved, but had to go to the venue early to actually get our tickets. Additionally, I wanted to visit the venue early because the merchandise booth was going to be open, too.</p><p>We went to the venue around Noon and waited for it to open. Plenty of other people were there, too. At 1:30pm, doors open but only a few people were allowed entry at a time. We eventually made it in at 2pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>At the entrance, we gave our reservations to the clerk, and they gave us our tickets. Inside were only a few people, and it was a line for the merch booth that curved around the room. </p><p>My goal was to purchase the concert towel for the event. In Japan, almost every concert or tour has a towel associated with it. It's kind of like a band's tour T-shirt in America. Tell 'em where you've been by buying a towel. The towel was 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> and I bought some stickers, too, for 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>. The tickets included a pamphlet of the concert, so I didn't buy that. Minutes after I purchased the towel, they were sold out, so I was able to get one in the nick of time. :)</p><p>We went back to my car to dump off our stuff, got some lunch, and went right back to the venue for the evening concert.</p><div class='title'><b>The Concert</b></div><p>We probably got back to the venue at 3pm or 3:30pm, and waited in line again. When the doors opened at 4pm, they were letting people in by sequential order of their tickets. Each individual ticket number was checked and let in by the order of when their tickets were purchased. You'd think this would take forever, but it went pretty quickly.  We made it in around 4:30pm, and the show began around 5:15pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The venue was tiny. Capacity was probably 1000 people? (as long as they were all smashed together) WAYYY smaller than the Tokyo or Osaka venues. It was nice, though. Much more intimate.</p><p>The band members took the stage in darkness, tuned their instruments, and the opening sequence for the concert began to play on the screen behind them. The dreamy motions of the title of screen of Chrono Cross. It detailed the preamble of the story.  And then, the heavy reverberations of the guitar being plucked as <b>Scars of Time</b> began, which moved into the light Flute.</p><p>It was incredible. It completely opened up my mind to hearing this music for the first time around 20 years ago when that first trailer dropped on the Internet, and when I imported the game on Playstation.</p><p>Mitsuda quickly introduced himself and the band as they played the opening menu music to the game. As "New Game" was selected, they played the battle music, which is how the game starts.</p><p>Overall, they played through the entirety of the game on the screen, and played the entirety of the soundtrack to accompany it.  I wrote down a rough setlist of what they played:</p><p><u>Main Set</u><br/>	1.	Chrono Cross - Scars of Time<br/>	2.	The Dream that Time Dreams<br/>	3.	Garden of God (Title Screen)<br/>	4.	Between Life and Death (Battle Music)<br/>	5.	Arni Village - Home World<br/>	6.	Arni Village - Another World<br/>	7.	Fields of Time - Home World<br/>	8.	Lizard Dance<br/>	9.	Termina - Another World<br/>	10.	Forest of Illusion<br/>	11.	Viper Mansion<br/>	12.	Gale (Boss Music)<br/>	13.	Victory (A Gift of Spring)<br/>	14.	Guldove - Another World<br/>	15.	Fortress of Ancient Dragons<br/>	16.	A Narrow Space Between Dimensions<br/>	17.	Dead Sea / Tower of Destruction<br/>	18.	Prisoners of Fate<br/>	19.	Magical Dreamers<br/>	20.	Zelbess<br/>	21.	Fate - The God of Destiny<br/>	22. Burning Orphanage??<br/>	23.	The Girl who Stole the Stars<br/>	24.	Frozen Flame<br/>	25.	Dragon God?? (Explanation for Elements. Screwing up, then Game Over)<br/>	26.	A Light for Lost Hopes (Game Over music)<br/>	27.	Life - Distance Promise (Elemental Song)<br/>	28.	Radical Dreamers - Unstolen Jewel<br/>	29.	Fragment of a Dream</p><p><u>Encore</u><br/>	1.	Song to get Mitsuda back on Stage<br/>	2.	Band Members Introduction Song<br/>	3.	Voyage - Another World??<br/>	4.	Voyage - Home World??<br/>	5.	Marbule - Another World</p><p>It wasn't like they just "played" the soundtrack to Chrono Cross. All of these were live variations of the original score. They deviated and mostly improved upon what they had before, and were able to match the crowd's reactions as they played. Much of the concert felt very interactive and Mitsuda explained a lot of his feelings and ideas for each song through the concert.</p><p>As the concert finished, there were credits on the screen, too. I have never been to a concert before with a credits screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Stuff</b></div><p>Concluding the show, this was all the stuff I came away with. I grabbed some of the heart confetti that were shot in the air during the concert, my light stick, and the things that I purchased earlier. Also included is a book of artwork we received as part of our ticket purchase. We also got a flame pendant, too, but that's not pictured here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Again, it was absolutely incredible and a dream come true to see, hear, and feel the music that has shaped my music tastes in video games. It was super dorky to rock out to RPG battle music. It was moving hearing Scars of Time and the other intro song live. And it was fun getting the audience to work together with their colored glowsticks to get the elements in the right order to get the true ending of the game/concert.</p><p>Mitsuda created an amazing concert, and with all of the production that went into the lights and video on display, I understand where the $168 price tag came from.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>With the conclusion of 2 additional final dates in Tokyo, Mitsuda has released an official set list from the concert.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" /></a></p><p>They also made an Apple playlist as well, so you can hear the music from the soundtrack.</p><p><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44" title="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44">https://music.apple.com/.../chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44</a></p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 12th, 2020</I></b></div><p>In a tweet, Mitsuda mentions that the final Nakano performance was recorded, and he is in the process of mastering the audio.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>As part of our ticket purchase, we were to receive a concert booklet of the event.

We filled out a card in order to receive this booklet later.</p><p>I got mine in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Calling this thing a booklet doesn't do it justice. In fact, this thing is thicker than most pre-order bonus art books. There are tons of photos from each of the events, interviews, sheet music, and logo designs. Almost all the production that went into planning the concert is included in the book.</p><p>This was BY FAR the most production value I've ever seen packed into a single musical event. In the beginning, it seemed like the concert was a huge expense, but it's clear how much love and care went into the event. Mitsuda clearly loves his music for Chrono Cross as much as his fans, and he loved this experience as much as we did.</p><p>It's an incredible memorial of the event.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - June 24th, 2020</I></b></div><p>This is the concert that keeps on giving. Today, Mitsuda and Procyon Studios released their recording of the final concert in Nakano Plaza.

It's absolutely incredible to be able to relive this concert again and again.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 25th, 2021</I></b></div><p>Everyone said it was going to happen, and today Procyon and Mitsuda announced a live Bluray release of the final concert performance at Nakano plaza. </p><p>I purchased the limited edition version of the Bluray which comes with a download for an arrangement album of Chrono tunes, and some extra stuff.  This cost a total of 14100<span class='ja'>円</span>, which is a lot for a Bluray, but this'll be the very last Mitsuda can ring out of me from the concert. 14100 for the bluray, 16800 for tickets, and 2800 for merch. This totals 33700<span class='ja'>円</span>, or about $337.</p><p>It was totally worth it, though.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - April 15th, 2021</I></b></div><p>The preorder for the Bluray concluded on March 1st, and 6 weeks later, I was finally able to catch my deliveryman and get my Bluray.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It includes a full Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience of the concert with absolutely crisp audio and a full video recording of the event, too.</p><p>Also included is a short pamphlet of photos from the event, and a download code for the arrangement album. This arrangement is okay. I don't think it's as mind-blowing as the actual concert, but it's still a great listen. Much more low-key, too.</p><p>…And now, finally the saga is concluded. An absolutely amazing concert with many ways to relive and cherish those memories.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DJ Promo #3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dj-promo-3">DJ Promo #3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 11, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, I DJed at a friend's party and made a couple of DJ Promos to commemorate and practice for the occassion. Both of those are available on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock">Soundcloud</a>, and I wrote a post about them: <a href="/old/v7/dj-promos" title="/dj-promos">October 14th</a>.</p><p>With 2 months spacing my two previous mixes apart, I figured that I would continue to make a new promo every 2 months.  That fell through when I didn't have internet for 3 months and wanted to download and use some new favorites, rather than the stuff I already had downloaded.  And then I got a new laptop, and had to reinstall and transfer things over to that.  And I was playing Skyrim every day for 6 hours in the month of December, too.</p><p>So, I skipped December, and here we are in February :)</p><div class='title'><b>Kind of Wintertime!</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp"  /></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="100%" height="81" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36255553&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" height="81" src="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36255553&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object> <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003">DyreSchlock 003</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock">dyreschlock</a></span></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 003.mp3</a></p><p>1. Trentmoller - Shades of Marble (Trentmoller Remix)<br/>2. Booka Shade - Teenage Spaceman (Sei A Bass Remix)<br/>3. Guy Gerber - Timing (Denis Kayron Dirty Hands Remix)<br/>4. Extrawelt - Titelheld<br/>5. Fergie - PCP (King Unique Remix)<br/>6. Henry Saiz &amp; Guy J - Meridian (Original Mix)<br/>7. Ian O'Donovan - Aurora Borealis (Henry Saiz 70's Remix)<br/>8. Max Cooper - Heresy (Dosem Remix)<br/>9. Spooky - Belong (Igor Cold Unofficial Remix)<br/>10. Slacker - Hymn to Her (Lank Bootleg)</p><p>There were some clear cut songs I wanted to include in this mix.  I wanted to end on Spooky - Belong, and I wanted to start with Shades of Marble (Trentmoller Remix).  Almost everything in between came from experimenting with other tracks, and just seeing what worked together.  Originally, I wanted to end on Orbital's new track "Never", but in its current 3 minute state, it is a difficult one to mix into.</p><p>I added Slacker - Hymn to Her at the end as a farewell to DJ Slacker, who <a href="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/" title="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/">passed away</a> in Thailand a couple weeks ago.  I wasn't super familiar with his work, but after listening to some of his tracks, I guess I knew him a little better than I thought.  I remember hearing his music from sets back in the day, and occassionally at The Quest in Minneapolis.  Hymn to Her is definitely my favorite and most recognizable of his, and I found a nice cut of it on Lank's Soundcloud.</p><p>My initial impressions with this mix were a little negative.  It didn't feel like it had an overall message, and it was just a bunch of tracks kind of thrown together.  But as I listen to the results over and over again, I think it turned out pretty well.  I think all the tracks at the beginning flow pretty well, and everything leads up to Henry Saiz's monster remix of Aurora Borealis.</p><p>Give it a listen, and let me know what you think :)</p><div class='title'><b>More mixes</b></div><p>My goal is to continue making these mixes every 2 months. Â Whether it be tracks I hear in the next two months, or some more favorites from years past, I plan on putting something together.</p><p>For me, mixing tracks (or attempting to mix tracks) is a good way of actually feeling how the music actually works with each other, rather than just listening to a single track on its own.  I'm not a DJ, nor do I really claim to be, so I don't really think about music in this way right off the bat.  I might think that two songs sound good together, but in practice they might not jive at all.</p><p>When I'm mixing these tracks together, I'm not doing anything fancy.  I'm really just using the cross fader, and letting the songs naturally mix together.  It's a pretty basic way to do things, and I'm doing it this way because I'm not familar enough with DJ software to do otherwise.  I'm really just sequencing tracks, rather than mixing them together.</p><p>But it forces me to make good decisions, and promote a natural layered flow through the mix.  So far so good.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Local Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-3-local-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Local Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Chicago and Minneapolis had the volume to garner fantastic international talent from all over the world, there was plenty going on right down the street from where I live.  The local scene has exploded over the last year, and we've actually been able to get some international talent as well thanks to the loyal scene in Madison.</p><p>Many events are pretty mainstream, but there are plenty of dudes in the area who have been DJing for more than 10 years, and know exactly where the music today comes from, and what makes the past so special, too.</p><p>Here are my favorite events I attended in town put on by some of the best talent in the Midwest.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Demetri Nocturnal, Psycotron, Scatter @ Poor Boy's Rave, Segredo // Dec 22nd</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/">http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/</a></p><p>No event was more surprising, or amazing than the second to last Poor Boy's Rave of the year.  It was a night of modern Psytrance that continued to be infused with classic Trance hits from the late 90s and 2000 until that beautiful classic sound took over completely.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp"  /></p><p>After Wyatt's opening set, Scatter took the stage and set the mood was some groovy Psytrance beats.</p><p>I don't pay attention to this genre at all, but it was very different than the Hallucinogen and Infected Mushroom I was told were representative of this genre.  Modern day Psytrance (at least according to these guys) was very similar to the classic sound of Trance I was in love with back in the day.</p><p>Scatter continued to hold that classic sound but with a harder edge.  Pyscotron picked up exactly where Scatter left off, but his sound became more melodic and dreamy.</p><p>Demetri Nocturnal took the stage and played a set that was straight out of the year 2000.  I haven't heard these songs in YEARS.  It was like listening to Paul Oakenfold in his prime.  This was exactly the sound I heard in clubs when I first started going out, and the sound that I had completely forgotten about.  It was the reason I went out back in the day, and the reason I have such love for Electronic Dance Music these days.</p><p>I never thought I'd hear this again, and this is why it was the most amazing moment I had in Madison throughout the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>2. The Gimp @ Jump Around, The Cardinal // July 27th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/">http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/</a></p><p>Likewise, one night in July, the Milwaukee Noise Collective was invited to spin at Wyatt's monthy event at The Cardinal, Jump Around.  This was a week before Caleb's big summer party, and I was gearing up to DJ that party all night long.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp"  /></p><p>A couple DJs started off the night, but when The Gimp, aka Brandon Standal, took over the decks the atmosphere completely changed.  It was another set infused with classic DJ tracks that I hadn't heard since the year 2000, and it built a wonder sound.  I was so happy to be with a bunch of my friends at the time.  This was the sound I wanted to bring to Caleb's party.</p><p>Brandon built up the atmosphere with several tracks and then slammed us with Above &amp; Beyond - On a Good Day.  The original Club Mix, not the slightly harder Metropolis mashup.  It was euphoria.  A perfect blend of old and new.</p><div class='title'><b>3. The Horrorist @ Inferno // May 14th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/">http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/</a></p><p>This party was definitely the drunkest I had been all year.  My friends and I somewhat pre-gamed at the Come Back Inn with some Boots.  I slammed some Red Bulls, and we went off to Inferno shortly after.  I was drinking Spotted Cow all night, one after the other.  After the event ended, everyone went across the street to an after party on the second story of some supply store.  And we continued partying for another 2 hours probably, I dunno, I don't remember.  I probably got home around 5am?</p><p>All the opening DJs put an entertaining sets that really set the mood for the night.  Some very hard tracks, mostly Electro House and Techno.  As time progressed and the headliner loomed, the sound become very focused on Techno, and continue to bang pretty hard.</p><p>The Horrorist took the stage and started laying down tracks.  He picked up the microphone and provided all the vocals himself.  He yelled and screamed into the mic along with the beat, and the crowd went absolutely crazy to it.  We yelled at the top of our lungs back at him.  YEAHHH!</p><p>Aside from being drunk and manic due to beer and Red Bull, it was definitely the most energetic party I've ever been to in Madison.  The crowd was completely in tune with his performance, and after Inferno closed, the vibe continued at the after party.</p><p>Despite how ridiculously drunk I was, I remember so much of that night.  It's crazy how incredible and unique that night was that it shown through any attempts of memory blindness. Also, it was great to have company with me so we could piece the evening together at a later date.  It was my favorite drunken night of the year :)</p><p>I think that funniest thing about this was that on Monday, I found out that they recorded the audio from the entire night.  After listening to set performed by The Horrorist, it really didn't sound all that great.  It was a fantastic night, but the majesty of it all was really in his stage presence and ridiculous amount energy pumping up the crowd.  That kind of thing doesn't translate to audio so well. :/</p><p>It was a night that you truly had to be there to experience it all.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Alex Hall @ Wobble, Electric Earth // Halloween</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/">http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/</a></p><p>Alex Hall is a member and featured artist of one of the music forums that I've frequented for quite a while now.  Hybridized.org specialized in Progressive Trance, and Progressive Breaks mostly.  The have huge acts such as Hybrid and Way Out West, but these days focuses a whole lot more on rising talent across the world.</p><p>Alex Hall became a member around the same time I found the forums, but I had no idea he lived in the midwest!  I came across his name on this event, and made it my mission to be in attendance.</p><p>A lot of the Wobble crew threw down some groovy sets, but mixed in some occasion medicore tracks.  One of the openers had some amazing classic Acid House tracks, but then mixed them into Skrillex, bleehhh.  One of the other openers started off with some Drum 'n Bass, and Alex Hall yelled out from the back room, "Drum 'n Bass is for pussies!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp"  /></p><p>Alex Hall took the stage as Satan.  This was the same night Wolfgang Gartner was at Segredo, and Alex's opening remarks were, "Who needs Wolfgang Gartner!  Let's Party!".</p><p>He spun a modern techno set with plenty recent huge hits including Pryda - Moksha and Eric Prydz - Personal Jesus.  It was great to hear such big name sound coming from a Wisconsin resident.  He ended on Mike Koglin - Enjoy the Silence and absolutely blew my mind.</p><p>It was a remarkable Halloween night.  Far better than what Wolfgang would've offered. :)</p><div class='title'><b>5. Wyatt Agard</b></div><p>@ The Cardinal (closing out a dead night)<br/>@ Segredo (opening for Halo)</p><p>Through the year, Wyatt has put on a ridiculous amount of shows.  He DJs at various gigs at least 3 or 4 times a week, and sometimes every single day of the week.  He puts on special events at The Majestic, holds a monthly show at The Cardinal, and weekly shows at Jolly Bobs, and Segredo.</p><p>Wyatt's an amazing dude, and there were two moments throughout the year that really popped for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp"  /></p><p>One late summer's eve at The Cardinal, the place was pretty much dead.  There was a bunch of people there at one point, but never more than 30 people on the dance floor, and eventually they all left leaving me alone out there to groove along.  Wyatt mixed in some of the amazing tracks throughout his set, and built a very progressive vibe.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo">Booka Shade - Regenerate (Pan Pot Remix)</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8">Moby - Pale Horses (Gui Boratto Remix)</a>, and some mashed up remix of Xpander (or at least it sounded like it.)</p><p>These were all tracks I had been groovy to over the summer, and it was great to hear them live. :)</p><p>Later on, when opening up for Halo Varga, he spun another fantastic Prog set.  And even managed to mix in an actual remix of Xpander, most likely the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8">Funkagenda Remix</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-2-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Popularity for DJs soured in 2011.  DJs of all genres and tastes are in high demand, and the promoters of Chicago worked their asses off all year round.</p><p>And with the massive success of the North Coast Music Festival in 2010, promotion company React opened up their own night club, The Mid.  The Mid saw an unprecedented amount of talent week after week after week.</p><p>Through the year, the following events were my favorites, and almost all of my favorite tracks of the year ended up on the turntables at them one way or another.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Kings of Progressive House</b></div><p>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo @ Sound-Bar, Chicago // December 16th<br/>Sasha @ The Mid, Chicago // March 12th<br/>John Digweed @ The Mid, Chicago // March 23rd</p><p>All 4 of the best in Progressive House visited Chicago throughout the year.  John Digweed and Hernan Cattaneo stopped by twice!  All of these guys are my favorite DJs, and having the chance to see them all live in a single year absolutely blows my mind.</p><p>But out these nights, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo was the clear Event of the Year for me.  After trying to see Nick live for the past 8 years, the top person on my music bucket list was finally crossed off.  They spun for over 4 hours, and fed off of each other the whole time.  Nick was create some massive builds, and Hernan continued the plateau of that build into his couple of tracks.  Back and forth, back and forth, it was absolutely brilliant.  Here's my words about it from the day after: <a href="/old/v7/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago" title="/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago">December 18th</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>Sasha's set from March was unlike anything I'd heard from him lately.  He had been building up his Never say Never vibe which was mostly Tech House, and Indie tracks.  It was a very light, glowing, and joyful sound from him.  By his March set from The Mid pulled him back into the pure darkness.  It was a dark set filled with Progressive House and Techno.  It completely blind sided me, and carried the rich atmosphere that made me a Sasha fan in the first place.</p><p>Digweed's set from March felt like a showcase of all the talent he would later release in the year.  It was right in the middle of WMC, and it felt like he was road testing a whole lot of tracks for the upcoming weekend.  Among them was my favorite track of the year, Meridian, and many other beautiful and banging tracks.  It was on a Wednesday as well, so the vibe wasn't really as crazy as the weekend, either.</p><p>I kind of wish I would've went down there for Digweed's follow up set in May, but I was busy in Madison that weekend.  Having him on a proper weekend date would have been special. :)</p><div class='title'><b>2. North Coast Music Festival</b></div><p>Carl Cox, James Zabiela, Ida Engberg, Steve Bug</p><p>With PAX scheduled one weekend before Labor Day, I had all weekend to take in Chicago's massive Electronic Dance Music festival.  And I wrote a detailed diary of everything I did that weekend.</p><p>Day 1 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-1" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-1">Friday September 2nd</a><br/>Day 2 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">Saturday September 3rd</a><br/>Day 3 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-3" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-3">Sunday September 4th</a></p><p>While it was heavy with mainstream acts, North Coast had so much going on at anyone time, there was something for everyone.  Many of the acts that I attended were refreshing and classic compared to the many Electro House, and Dubstep acts of today.</p><p>James Zabiela spun and scratched some amazing breaky tracks on Friday.  It had been so long since I have heard any breakbeats live, I had almost forgot what they sounded like.  His set at the festival was only a taste of the mayhem he brought to Sound Bar that evening.  He mixed breaks into some amazing progressive house tracks.  It was fantastic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>Carl Cox blew my mind the next day as he performed a massive genre bending set that ripped into the crowd around his stage.  He spun Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz towards the beginning of his set, absolutely ruined the crowd, and kept up that energy and electricity throughout the rest of his set.  It was incredible.</p><p>For an after party, Five and I went to see Andy Moor at Vision.  While not a sanctioned North Coast after party, it was another highlight on my weekend.  It was great to hear harmonizing hard trance that didn't feel too generic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp"  /></p><p>At the end of Sunday, I went to Transit for a night of that classic House sound I grew up hearing in Minneapolis.  Steve Bug played a solid smooth House set, and Ida Engberg pumped up the energy with her brand of Techno.</p><p>It was a fantastic (and beautiful) weekend, and one of the best of the best of the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>3. M83 @ First Avenue, Minneapolis // November 16th</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp"  /></p><p>On a Wednesday in November, I drove up to Minneapolis and finally had the chance to see M83, one of my favorite bands.  I am a huge fan of their songs Teen Angst, Couluers, and their new lead single Midnight City.  The event was part of their tour for their new double length album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.</p><p>And seeing them live for the first (real) time was a dream.  They played all of their amazing hits from the new album, and all of their amazing hits from their previous album, Saturday = Youth, and plenty of amazing tracks from their past.  Hearing Teen Angst live and Couleurs live had been a dream of mine for a while, and it was another moment of crossing things off my music bucket list.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp"  /></p><p>As soon as they started playing Midnight City, all of First Ave was hopping up in the air, and tearing the roof off of the place.  It was tremendous, and a true show of how everyone there was feeling the exact same vibe.  From hipsters to business men, from moms to teens, from loving couples to singles, everyone embraced in the love pounding from the stage.  It was absolutely one of the best moments of the year.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Twisted in Madison</b></div><p>Shpongle @ The Majestic, Madison // April 26th<br/>Ott @ The Majestic, Madison // March 18th</p><p>My favorite psychedelic artists were on tour in 2011, and both of them made their way to Madison for two very special nights.  Twisted is the record label both them are a part of, though I think Ott may have split from them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp"  /></p><p>Ott was fresh off releasing a new album, Mir, with the beautiful and surreal track Adrift in Hilbert Space.  He had been to Madison the year before, but his 2011 experience showed a more enthusiastic and motivated Ott.  He was no longer just performing the same songs he already had.  His new album invigorated him, and that energy passed on to the crowd.</p><p>The whole night was a journey into his unique sound, and it was fantastic being there with like minded fans from the area.</p><p>The same thing happened again one month later with Shpongle, aka Simon Posford, label boss of the Twisted label.  Simon took us through a journey of Shpongle's greatest hits mixed in with several tracks from other artists on the Twisted label.  He was DJing in Minneapolis the year before, but to hear him locally at the Majestic with so many other fans was truly special.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp"  /></p><p>The event was as music visual as it was aural.  Shpongle brought with him the Sphongletron, a unique stage setup the used LEDs, back projectors, and a power front projector that illuminated the Shpongle head on the front of the Sphongletron.  The Shpongle light up during songs, and the lighting moved around the head to give the impression of a physical moving light.  And then!  The head started to move!  The head opened up his mouth, and his tongue started licking around his face.  And then!  The head began to twist and turn along with the trippy music.  At first, I had no idea what was going on.  It looked like the physical statue was moving and contorting on its own.  It was amazing and mesmerizing.</p><p>It was a night as unique as their respective sounds, and fantastic to seem them just down the street from where I lived. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Tracks" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-1-tracks">Favorite Music of 2011 - Tracks</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2011 was probably the best year for music for me.  With Electronic Dance Music's popularity at an all time high, the genre has gotten a large amount of attention, and DJs and artists have been working non-stop at getting their names out there, and promoters have been going over the top all year round to bring the world's greatest talent to their city.</p><p>There has been some amazing new music, mixed in with fantastic local talent and events.  Over the course of 2011, I've seen almost all of my favorite DJs and heard fantastic new music, and plenty of oldies as well, and they have opened my ears to some fantastic talent and music that made the perfect soundtrack to 2011.</p><p>Here are my favorite I heard throughout the year.  Almost all of them I was introduced to in a live setting, or later heard them live.</p><p class='img'><b>1. Guy J &amp; Henry Saiz - Meridian</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU</a></p><p>This massive track debuted towards the end of the year, but had support from John Digweed since Spring.  As he shopped it around, he knew he was sitting on something big, and made it part of the 100th release on his record label, Bedrock.</p><p>It has beautiful atmosphere that continues to build and build with a unique electricity.</p><p class='img'><b>2. David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA</a></p><p>Another massive track that Sasha shopped around as part of his Never say Never residency at Ushuaia in Ibiza.  This distinct track always shone through the tracks he was mixing, and was the highlight of a several track build.  It has that perfect summer Tech House feel.</p><p class='img'><b>3. M83 - Midnight City</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE</a></p><p>From start to finish, Midnight City exudes energy.  It has this classic feel-good sound.  I can't help but smile whenever I hear it.  It's a perfect follow-up to many of M83's other amazing hits, like Teen Angst and Couleurs.</p><p>I saw them at First Ave in Minneapolis, and when they started playing this song, the entire club erupted in cheers, and jumping, and dancing, and smiles everywhere.</p><p class='img'><b>4. Nick Warren - Beunos Aires</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8</a></p><p>Another distinctive progressive track from the very best in Progressive House.  Beunos Aires has a very smooth undertone that hooked me the moment I heard it.  It guides the track, and them slams you with the melody.  It's a really hard banging track, but the light melody likes to disguise itself as something else.  It's interesting, and works together amazingly well.</p><p>When Nick Warren played this song in Chicago, it made my day.  It made my year.  Different one of my favorite moments I've experienced in Dance music. :)</p><p class='img'><b>5. Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA</a></p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, I would say this is my favorite purely hard track of the year.  When a DJ throws down this track, there's no way to ignore it.  It rips through the scene and everyone pays attention.  The amount of raw energy captured in this song transfers itself to the audience, and mayhem ensues.</p><p>Carl Cox played this one at North Coast and everyone flipped out.  Everyone was on their feet hopping around.</p><p class='img'><b>6. Ott - Adrift in Hilbert Space</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/06_ott_hilbert_space.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/06_ott_hilbert_space.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/06_ott_hilbert_space.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LuQvTiVfg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LuQvTiVfg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LuQvTiVfg</a></p><p>It starts off for a perfectly light atmosphere, and then that initial guitar riff hits.  It throws shivers down my spine.  The vocals and synth further capture my attention.  And then the song guide me on a journey of sound.  This is definitely one of the most beautiful tracks I've heard all year.  And hearing Ott perform this live was very special.  All the melodic bits pop, and it's an atmosphere I can't escape from.</p><p class='img'><b>7. Rone - So So So</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/07_rone_sososo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/07_rone_sososo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/07_rone_sososo.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPkUKw9DIlw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPkUKw9DIlw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPkUKw9DIlw</a></p><p>So So So is a symphony of melody.  It's spacey and easy to lose yourself in.  Unfortunately, it's too short!</p><p class='img'><b>8. Omid 16B - Rain</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/08_omid16b_rain.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/08_omid16b_rain.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/08_omid16b_rain.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5twD9V3P60" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5twD9V3P60">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5twD9V3P60</a></p><p>Rain is ridiculously smooth, with an electric hard energy.  As the song progresses, the energy diversifies and iterates on itself, creating a unique atmosphere other tracks WISH they could replicate.  It continues to pound, and pound, and pound.  This song is relentless and amazing.</p><p class='img'><b>9. Summer (Brendon Collins) - Phantom</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/09_summer_phantom.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/09_summer_phantom.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/09_summer_phantom.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tuliparecordings/summer-brendon-collins-phantom" title="http://soundcloud.com/tuliparecordings/summer-brendon-collins-phantom">http://soundcloud.com/tuliparecordings/summer-brendon-collins-phantom</a></p><p>Another fantastic and unique track from Brendon Collins, and my favorite track of his this year.  Sasha played this one in Chicago, and it was definitely the highlight of the second half of the night.  It's spacey and hypnotic.  The build-ups are super smooth.  I love it. :)</p><p class='img'><b>10.

| October 14, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I've been a fan of the music for over a decade.  And I continue to listen to the music, both new and old, almost all day long.  I'm always finding some new tracks, or great new artists I hadn't heard of before.  The Internet continues to bring the world of music together, and people can easily display their works, get feedback, and evolve fast.</p><p>I go out to local clubs fairly regularly, and watch how the local talent evolves.  As well as make the trek to Minneapolis or Chicago to see some of the best DJs in the world evolve and shape the industry.</p><p>I have always had the fascination of DJing myself.  Back in the day, this was impossible for me.  At $10 a pop, records are not cheap.  Plus, I needed to buy all the equipment, and there was no guarantee I'd be any good at it.  Before DJs went digital, most local DJs either worked at, or spent all their free time in record stores.  They'd be exposed to all the new tracks, and have the equipment available to them on a daily basis.  I didn't have the knowledge, the skills, or the money to invest in doing any of that.</p><p>But in modern times all of that has changed.  All the record stores are online, and you can fit DAYS worth of music in your pocket.  Songs are a mere $1 or $2.  And the only equipment you need to start off with is a laptop with the correct software.  As time goes on, you'll probably pick up equipment to make it easier and more diverse. The best local DJs end up spending all their time on the computer, whether it be on the Internet, or playing around with tracks.</p><p>With that in mind, my friends finally convinced me to give it a go.  I already had collected a bunch of my favorite tracks I've heard over the years, and a whole bunch of new ones.  I downloaded Traktor, and started mixing them together.</p><div class='title'><b>Summertime!</b></div><p>One of my friends throws his annual bonfire party towards the end of summer, and he let me in charge of the music. Leading up to the party, I would collect a bunch of music during the day while listening at work.  When I got home, I'd download them, and mix them all together for the rest of the night.  Things sounded pretty decent.</p><p>I made a promo mix leading up to his party, so people would have an idea of the sound I was bringing.  Or after the party, people could have something to listen to.</p><p>So that's this mix...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 001.mp3</a></p><p>It includes many favorites that I can't get enough of. :)</p><p>1. Guy J - Heliscope<br/>2. Radiohead - Reckoner (Henry Saiz's Vocal Mantra Remix)<br/>3. Exoplanet - Shepherd of Consciousness (Moonbeam Remix)<br/>4. Booka Shade - Regenerate (Pan-Pot Remix)<br/>5. Denis A - Ocean (Monaque Remix)<br/>6. Christian Cambas - Fireball (Original Mix)<br/>7. Omid 16B - Rain<br/>8. John Digweed - Gridlock (Digweed &amp; Miur's Stereo Club Mix)<br/>9. Unkle - Heavy Drug (King Unique Smoke Nest Mix)<br/>10. Orbital - Halcyon + On + On (Aaron Static 2011 Bootleg)<br/>11. Rone - So So So</p><p>Though, it is heavy on the Bedrock artists: Guy J, Henry Saiz, Omid 16B, and John Digweed.  Which explains why many of the songs mix together as well as they do.  Orbital - Halcyon + On + On is one of my favorite songs, and Aaron Static's bootleg is an amazing cut of it.</p><p>Overall the party was quite a success.  Gage lent me his mixing board and speakers, so things sounded excellent.  I mixed tracks together for about 8 hours from mid-afternoon into the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>End of Summertime!</b></div><p>After the party, I was busy with a bunch of other things and didn't really get back to mixing more tracks.  I had another DJ mix lined up to record after the party, and I've heard some amazing music since then.  I wanted to make another one before I got the Internet restored in my apartment, and start downloading a whole lot of new tracks.  I wanted to capture some of arrangements I found while mixing stuff together for 8 hours.</p><p>After listening to what I had, a lot of it didn't really fit in a one hour time slot.  There really wasn't a good starting point and ending point to include what I wanted.  So, I basically cut it in half, and built up the first chunk with the following mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 002.mp3</a></p><p>1. Golan Globus - Blazer (Version 2)<br/>2. Pezzner - Almost Here Pt 3<br/>3. Caribou - Sun (Midland Re-Edit)<br/>4. Nick Warren - Buenos Aires<br/>5. King Unique - Sugarhigh (Dan Alcala Sweet Stuff Remix)<br/>6. Hybrid - I Know (Keenan &amp; Anderson Remix)<br/>7. Underworld - Two Months Off (Grayarea's Four Year Off Remix)<br/>8. Solarstatik - Waypoint<br/>9. Daft Punk - C.L.U. (Paul Oakenfold Remix)<br/>10. Radiohead - Everything in its Right Place (Oakenfold 2008 Remix)</p><p>I worked backwards piecing together some melodic sounds building up to the somewhat cheesy ending I started off with.  That Pezzner track mixes perfectly with Blazer, and Dan Alcala's Sugarhigh remix is probably the highlight of this set for me.  So smooth :)</p><p>This mix probably would have had a lot more Prog Trance if I had more sources of that type of music.  Trying to keep this mix diverse was hard which is why it turned out so melodic and smooth to start with.  I needed something leading up to Two Months Off, and I didn't want to start off dark.</p><p>But I'm happy with the result :)  I love listening to this kind of music while traveling.</p><div class='title'><b>Falltime</b></div><p>I have a selection of tracks picked out for my next mix, but I haven't arranged them in a cohesive way.  So it's possible I'll end up with something completely different than I intended, much like this last mix.</p><p>Good Times :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music-2">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My favorite trance duo of all time is Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden.  I've been of a fan of theirs since near the beginning, and some of their DJ sets I could listen to hours and hours over and over.  When they're on, they have the perfect mix of ambiance, harmony, and melody complete with an underlying beat that never tires me.</p><div class='title'><b>The Beginning</b></div><p>The duo formed around 2001 and 2002.  I think they really made it big when the played at the Pawn Shop at WMC 2002.  Later that year, Markus Schulz started featuring them on the Global DJ Broadcast every few months.  Leading into WMC 2003, they had their own Essential Mix, and during WMC 2003 their popularity exploded.</p><p>They first I had heard of them wasn't too long after that.  At the time, I was downloading DJ sets from the website djmixes2k.com.  Each week, they'd record the guest mixes from the Global DJ Broadcast, and host them on their site.  G&amp;D had a guest mix on July 6th, 2003, and it was one of the best mixes I had ever heard.  I was an instant fan.</p><p>I tried to find other stuff, and kept a look out for any new sets, but it wasn't as easy as it is today.  All of the music sharing communities were behind closed doors, and I really didn't have anything to offer in order to open them.  I just stuck to whatever showed up on djmixed2k.com.</p><p>They had two very solid tracks, As the Rush Comes and Beautiful Things.  Josh Gabriel is a technical wizard.  While other DJs were still running with Vinyl, and some using CDs, he was already embracing change beyond with Ableton.  Ableton is DJ software that can mix tracks on the fly. When Josh Gabriel took over the decks, all the track seamlessly melded together.  Tracks were mixed, remixed, and sampled to form a unique performance that was completely new at the time.  And backed by Dave Dresden amazing sense for track selection, their sets were always cohesive to the point it felt like a symphony.</p><div class='title'><b>Their Prime</b></div><p>2003 was an amazing year for Gabriel &amp; Dresden, and they continued to climb in 2004.  That's when I finally got the chance to see them.  They stopped by Vision, Chicago on Feb 28th, 2004. In fact, I had the opportunity to actually meet with them before the show through one of tranceaddict.com's meetups.  Their meetups had been very successful with Armin van Buuren, but when I arrived at the bar, there were only 5 of us.  Gabriel &amp; Dresden showed up, and we all had an awkward chat about random stuff.</p><p>Their performance was everything I had come to know them for. Harmonious and melodic trance that was way beyond what I was hearing from most other artists and DJs.  Hearing As the Rush Comes, Beautiful Things, and No one on Earth all live for the first time was a treat for me too.</p><p>Here are some pictures from that event: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago">http://theschlock.com/club/040228/index.html</a></p><p>Later on in September, they finally made it to Minneapolis.  Pictures: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis" title="/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis">http://theschlock.com/club/040903_dresden/index.html</a></p><p>They continued to dominate throughout the year.  They released their first artist album and mix CD, and continued to pound out some amazing remixes, and performances.</p><p>Unfortunately, I started to loose track of them in 2005.  2005 was an awkward year as DJs made the inevitable transition from analog to digital.  Vinyl could not cut it any longer and it was either going to be CDs or Laptops going forward.  Also, during that time I was focusing on schoolwork and other hobbies which kept me at home in Platteville, rather than out in Chicago Saturday night.  I was still listening to their music downloaded from the Internet, but I wasn't actively seeking it out.</p><div class='title'><b>The Split</b></div><p>It wasn't until 2008 and 2009 that I returned to the dance music community, and actively starting following DJs again.  When I started looking up what Gabriel &amp; Dresden had been doing over the past years, they were no more.  In early 2008 they announced that they were breaking up, and at WMC 2008, they played their final performance at the Pawn Shop, the very spot that made them international acclaimed.</p><p>Their split makes sense though.  Even though they were a duo, they never played back to back.  It was always one than the other.  Dave wanted to play more housey "raise the roof" kinda tunes, while Josh wanted to actually build and blend a performance.</p><p>I went back through all the sets that I had missed, and none of them really had the same harmony as those original sets back in 2003.  There are some amazing gems in the bunch, though.  Their Banana Beach Bar set from Aug 14th, 2006 brings their later years very very close to their early years.  And their set from Guvernment, Toronto on Nov 16th, 2007 is an amazing mix of their later style.  I would say that it's the definitive Gabriel &amp; Dresden set of their later years.</p><p>Their final set from the Pawn Shop, WMC on Mar 28th, 2008 has been recorded, but it's not as tight or as expressive as the Guvernment set.  Maybe that's because all eyes were on them that day, and they went for technical greatness, rather than taking chances.</p><p>I don't really feel like I missed much having left them in 2005.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo</b></div><p>Unfortunately, I don't think they got the same acclaim running solo as they had hoped.  Dave Dresden and Josh Gabriel came through Chicago several times in 2009 and 2010.  And every time I saw they were coming, it didn't really register with me.  Even though when they were together on stage, their performances were separate.  I don't really know.  Together, they just had some kind of magic that blew everyone away.</p><div class='title'><b>Reunion</b></div><p>I think they figured this out as well, because in late 2010 they announced they would be taking the stage at the Hollywood Paladium together for New Years Eve.  Tickets sold out immediately, and the message boards went nuts.  It would have been amazing to be there in person.</p><p>They recorded part of their set and put it online, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-nye-2011" title="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-nye-2011">right here</a>.  I found it a little disappointing though.  The tracks didn't really compliment each other.  Most were just a bunch of other tracks that trance DJs were already playing.  It didn't have a unique sound at all, let alone did it sound like Gabriel &amp; Dresden.</p><p>"Well that sucks," I thought as I went back to listening to someone else.</p><p>But they were persistent.  A couple months later, they did another reunion show in DC, and again at Ultra Music Festival with Above &amp; Beyond.  I listened to their sets, and, again, it sounded no different than what other DJs were doing.  But the community was incredibly supportive.  G&amp;D signed on for a reunion tour, and now have basically announced that they have reunited for good.</p><p>I hadn't really been blown away by their reunion thus far, but when The Mid, Chicago announced G&amp;D were coming in July, I bought those tickets immediately.  I'm still a fan after all. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Reunited</b></div><p>This past weekend, they had 4 shows and 2 of them have showed up online.  Beta Nightclub on June 16th (<a href="http://www.tranceaddict.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=605277&forumid=6&s=" title="http://www.tranceaddict.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=605277&forumid=6&s=">info</a>) and Electric Daisy Carnival on June 18th (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-at-1" title="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-at-1">info</a>).  Both of these sets are very similar, and both sound pretty damn great.  After 6 months of being reunited, I think they've finally found their unique sound that sets them apart from everyone else.</p><p>Their melody, harmony, and catchy beats have returned, which makes me very very happy.  I can't wait to see them in July.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/music/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
