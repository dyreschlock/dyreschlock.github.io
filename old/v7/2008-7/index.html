| July 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I bought something rather frivolous.  When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera in the Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/opera-in-the-park">Opera in the Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Opera in the Park, Brat Fest, Rhythm and Booms..  Art fair on the Square was pretty well attended too.  What other traditional Madison festivals and fairs are there?  At the end of the night, they announced that over 13,000 people were there which is pretty incredible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" /></p><p>The event started around 8pm and went on into the night.  The first two songs that began with I had heard in one form or another before hand, but had never heard the actual song.  Largo al factotum (the figaro song) and Anvil Chorus I remember from Looney Tunes. ^_^  The figaro song is also usually heard in commercials too.  Usually spaghetti sauce commercials.  I think it's kinda funny that the height of my opera experience was from other forms of media using it either poorly or commercially, but at least I had some exposure to it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was the perfect day for laying in the park listening to some fantastic music. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Madama Butterfly</b></div><p>Despite not knowing anything about Opera, there is one opera that I know of thanks to Asian American Literature at Platteville and that is Madama Butterfly.  I think we read the original short story, Madame Butterfly, the opera was based on.  It was rather brief, but gave us the background needed to start reading M. Butterfly, which is a play inspired by the book.</p><p>Madame Butterfly is about a Japanese Geisha woman in Nagasaki known to her friends as Butterfly.  She meets an US sailor, Pinkerton, who's ship is in town.  They fall in love and get married, but Pinkerton must return to the states.  The main emotion of the story is Butterfly's longing and loyality to Pinkerton as she continues to work as a Geisha   She continues to wait and wait and wait for his return, despite her friends constantly telling her that he's never going to return.  That he doesn't love her and it was just a little fling for him.  She continues to believe in Pinkerton.  AND.. Many twists and turns happen when Pinkerton finally returns to Nagasaki.</p><p>M. Butterfly is an interesting parallel tale of love between the actors who portrey the characters in a similar opera featuring cross-dressing and John Lithgow.</p><p>Anywho, Madama Butterfly is being performed by the Madison Opera in November!  I'm totally going.  I think I'll try to read the books again beforehand.  They also have a preview/lecture about the play a week before that'll probably be interesting, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Protomen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-protomen">The Protomen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 22, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The more and more I listen to The Protomen's self-titled album, the more and more brilliance I find with it after each listen.</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics are crap</b></div><p>I'm a big believer that lyrics in music are complete crap and a waste of time.  Comedy is the only genre where lyrics are the focal point, but in other genres, the lyrics are basically there to mask the poor music performance going on behind the singer.  Lyrics give you a biased opinion of what the song is supposed to about, rather than having the song relay that message on its own.  You should be able to dip into the music like a pool of emotion and float along with everyone else.</p><p>This is why I hate nearly all music.  As a kid, I hated Pop and Rock..  I couldn't stand it.  It just sounded like a bunch of noise with no cohesion and poorly crafted lyrics that were inaudible.  Some of my friends started getting me into Electronica which built itself on repetition, layers and absolutely no lyrics in the way..  It was the first time I actually started listening to music, rather than just hearing it.</p><p>After understanding music a little more, lyrics are still pretty annoying, but work incredibly well with some songs.  Electronica is historically known for having the worst written lyrics, but they're always easier to learn.  Then you can add your own noise to the aural atmosphere.  You are right there with the singer and everyone else chanting the lyrics.  The lyrics are generally strategically placed in the song to build on the mood rather than tell you how to feel.</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics aren't that bad</b></div><p>The Protomen is a metal/garage rock opera.  It's a 38 minute story in 7 parts that <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen-frequency" title="/the-protomen-frequency">I wrote about before</a>.  It tells of Protoman's epic struggle and death, and Megaman's rise to follow in his footsteps and eventually confront him circa Megaman 3.</p><p>Each lyric is a sentence of the story that serves telling this story and flowing in harmony with the guitars, keyboards and drums.  The lyrics are another instrument in this symphony that is not more or less important than another.  I've rarely heard lyrics used this way before. ^_^  Maybe that's because the lyrics are telling a story with an overall emotion rather than constantly explaining that emotion.</p><p>Anywho.. Check them out if you get a chance.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lake Delton" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lake-delton">Lake Delton</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Eventually I found a book landing and was able to walk along the bottom of the lake.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1650.webp" /></p><p>You can't even drive to the edge of the water anymore.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1601.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1601.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1601.webp" /></p><p>It was incredibly eerie to walk along the bottom knowing that the water level is supposed to be one or two feet above my head.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1605.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1612.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1616.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1623.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1623.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1630.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1630.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1630.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1646.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1646.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1646.webp" /></p><p>The bottom of Lake Delton was mostly a sandy surface.  It was just like walking on a beach.  There was a bit of a stream running through the sand.  I took off my sandals, rolled up my pant legs and walked around in the water a little bit to get some close up pictures.  The water was cool compared to the warmed up sands.</p><p>However, I was incredibly careful...  The entire time I was thinking about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc">this youtube video</a> and another video of a guy sinking in mud or quicksand really fast and completely vanished.  I thought of these when I was slowing sinking in the sand while walking in the water, but it hadn't happened the entire time out there.  Until, I stopped thinking about it...  and sunk down past my knees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't running or anything, so I was right near the edge of the solid sandy surface and the mud pit, so pulling myself out was pretty easy.  The whole time I kept slowing sinking down and kept saying to myself, "stop stop stop stop stop...  holy crap."  Luckily I had already taken my sandals off or I probably would've had to buy new ones.  Though my sandals probably kept my "afloat" longer having a larger area to step on rather than the thin area my feet cover.</p><p>I didn't stray too far from shore after that. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, Lake Delton is pretty screwed..  It probably looked like hell after it initially drained with all the dead fish corpses and more perilous mud pits.  There's a new article today that said crews are beginning to repair the dam this week, so it might be fixed by next year.  I wonder what it'll look like in winter.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Leinenkugel's" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/leinenkugels">Leinenkugel's</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Zach got a fancy internship at Cray Computers for the summer, but has found that working in the middle of nowhere leads to much loneliness.  I saw Dark Knight with him on the way up, and with a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon ahead of us, we went to the Leinenkugel's Brewery which is also in Chippewa Falls.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" /></p><p>It was quite quaint but also pretty fancy too.</p><div class='title'><b>Leinie Lodge</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" /></p><p>The main public facility in the Leinie Lodge which is a big gift shop and also the place to sign up for a tour of the brewery itself.  Inside they had tons of crappy merchandise.  They put the Leinie logo on nearly everything..  from postcards to notebooks to fishing tackle to shirts to chairs to rulers to hold punchers to anything really.</p><p>It was really annoying because it took me forever to find a keychain bottle opener to match my New Glarus one.  I should've picked up a pint glass to match my New Glarus ones too, but I didn't think of it.  It doesn't really matter though, since those glasses were kinda ugly.</p><p>We signed up for the tour and off we went an hour later.</p><div class='title'><b>Brewery</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" /></p><p>This here is the main bottling facility which is where 100% of the tour went.  We went up and down the elevator a couple times to the 4 floors that serviced the actually creation of the beer.  The mixing of the hops, wheat and all that crap I wasn't paying attention to..</p><p><b>Fact</b>: They still add their active and flavoring ingredients by hand during the process, which allows them to still fall in the category of a Craft Brewery.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Also, they employ less than 52 workers at any given time to also keep this status.</p><p>We went got outside and went into another portion of the building that serviced bottling and then shipping.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Every single bottle or can or keg produced by the brewery has been ordered in advance. They never make more than what is already spoken for.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: A good chunk of their workers are hired help for the summer from local colleges.  This is why they have a bunch of summer and fall beers, but not many winter and spring beers.</p><p>I learned a few things, but that was pretty much it.  It was a neat tour and the tour guide was cute.  Zach started talking with her quite a bit as the tour ended about this and that. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Comparing tastes...</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" /></p><p>The whole area of the brewery was really nice.  Plenty of trees throughout the facility, and a babbling brouk passing between the Leinie lodge and the Brewery.  It was more pleasant than the other two brewerys I've been to.</p><p>The New Glarus Brewery is alright..  but it's really small.  The tours are self guided, so you can show up at anytime and walk through the place.  They give you a little phone thingy you can punch numbers into when you see them on the wall, but it's all rather useless info.  The giftshop had useful things and actually sold the beer, though.</p><p>Times are changing though, as New Glarus has just expanded to open up their much larger facility on the other side of the town.  From the road, it looks probably just as big as the Leinie brewery.  They still plan on keeping their original brewery open for their craft beers, but will use the new facility for more mass production.</p><p>The other brewery I've been to is the Asahi Beer Factory in Fukuoka, Japan, which is absolutely different than these two.  The Asahi Brewery is massive.  Bigger than most Wal*marts I've been to.  The production is super fast and their volume is huge.  It definitely lacked the heart of our wisconsin brewerys, though..  Also, I couldn't understand what the hell the guide was talking about.</p><div class='title'><b>Local is better</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" /></p><p>Overall, I'd say this has been the best Brewery Tourery I've been on.  The Leinie's brewery has a lot more history than New Glarus but still keeps everything down to earth.  I still like New Glarus' Spotted Cow over anything that Leinie's has, but Leinie is a great goto beer.  You can find it nearly everywhere and it never lets you down. ^_^</p><p>Leinie's Octoberfest beer should start showing up at retailers in the next few weeks, so that'll replace Spotted Cow for me for a little while. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure what other brewerys I'd like to check out next..  maybe I'll go to Ireland and check out Guiness or something.  I'd like to go back to the Asahi Beer factory and get a keychain bottle opener to match my other ones.  I'm sure I'll find myself somewhere.</p><p>As another note, Zach and I came across a tanning salon with a must hilarious name:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Heath Ledger's Joker" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/heath-ledgers-joker">Heath Ledger's Joker</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b><em>SPOILERS</em></b></div><p>As I'm sure everyone else has said, Heath Ledger as Joker is brilliant.  Not the casting call, but Ledger's acting job,  it's Fricken incredible.</p><p>I found it really interesting that Nolan intentionally neglected to provide an back story for The Joker.  I'm sure it was the exact same case for the criminals of Gotham when Batman appeared.  One day, he just showed up and completely ruined everything for them.  One day, this day, Joker just showed up and changed the equation again.</p><p>He's not just some super villain for Batman to fight in another Batman movie..  he's a true nemesis.  He exists because Batman exists.  There's no other reason to Joker's plot or ambition.  It's just to put wrong with what is right.  To play around with society and knock it off it's tracks.</p><p>Everything else in the movie was muted compared to Joker.  Everyone else took backstage and I really didn't care about them because Joker cast such dark shadow of their acting abilities.  Why the hell does Bale talk like he's coughing as Batman anyways?  Dent completely changed character so fast after becoming Two-Face..  yeah yeah, he's two-faced, but he went to killing cops kinda fast.  Gary Oldman was fantastic as Gordon, but his character whispers all the time and doesn't stand out.</p><p>It's a truly sad affair that Heath Ledger killed himself earlier in the year with a drug overdose.  All that potential and brilliance is completely gone now, but I guess it doesn't matter.  It puts his performance completely stand-alone in the series.  Between both movies, this feels like the climax of the entire new Batman movie series.  What other super-villian could come along and mean more to the series as Joker?  Mr. Freeze?  Poison Ivy?</p><p>I think Nolan has outdone himself, and even though they are working on the next Batman movie already, how can it really compare?  This first movie looks silly compared to this thanks to the Joker.</p><p>Joker, Joker, Joker..  that's all Dark Knight really is to me.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Free-Running Game" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/free-running-game">Free-Running Game</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Despite all its flaws, Assassin's Creed is incredibly fun because of it's Free-Running.  It's a shame that all the missions and story elements slow the overall experience rather than strengthen it.  The speed reminds me a little bit of Burnout Paradise where you'll make an infinite amount of mistakes that will slow your progress, but in time you'll learn your location and begin to use it to your advantage.</p><p>I almost wish that there was a Free-Running racing game in the works.  You'd think Sega would've done an incredible Sonic the Hedgehog game by now, but... you'd be dead wrong.</p><p>All this Free-Running in the ancient world has got me even more excited for the upcoming game entitled <b>Mirror's Edge</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>First Contact</b></div><p><b>Mirror's Edge</b> is a 1st person free-running game that reminds me a lot of The Matrix, Portal, and Oni.  I first came across this game when GameGirl.com did a <a href="http://www.gamegirl.com/article/79313/mirrors-edge-preview/" title="http://www.gamegirl.com/article/79313/mirrors-edge-preview/">feature</a>.  The initial trailer looked stunning.</p><p><b>Trailer 1</b>: <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/33586.html" title="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/33586.html">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/33586.html</a></p><p>You play as Faith, a message courier in a world ruled by Police and controlled information.  As a Courier your duty is to transport messages from point A to point B without being caught and keep information free.</p><p>Despite being developed by DICE, known for Battlefield 1942 and subsequent games, the focus is completely on movement and your character.  As the GameGirl preview says, Carrying a weapon only slows you down so you'll have to make decisions whether or not you'll need a gun.</p><div class='title'><b>This week</b></div><p>With E3 in full swing, everyone has gotten the chance to play Mirror's Edge and everyone sounds quite positive about it.  When playing the game, you have to overcome your own paradigm of how far you can jump and what you can do and begin thinking in terms of the character and what she can do, how far she can jump, and so forth.</p><p>Here's someone running through the demo: <a href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19944" title="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19944">http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19944</a><br/>(via <a href="http://kotaku.com/5025214/mirrors-edge-e3-demonstration" title="http://kotaku.com/5025214/mirrors-edge-e3-demonstration">kotaku</a>)</p><p>As you can see, it's the exactly same scenario as the previous trailer except now you have someone demostrating it, rather than someone going through it perfectly.</p><p>Jeff Green of GFW was saying that designers had designed the levels in such a way that when you first go through them, you're basically finding any way to the end.  The put easy ramps and jumps in places that you can naturally find.  But once you've gone through the game a bit further and get more familiar with what Faith can do, when you go back to the original levels you'll start to see more short cuts.  The game is kinda designed for speed runs and time trials.</p><p>One huge concern that people are having about this game is the obvious motion sickness and vertigo created by the constant movement and high altitude leaps.  Joystiq has an <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/17/how-mirrors-edge-fights-simulation-sickness/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/17/how-mirrors-edge-fights-simulation-sickness/">article</a> that explains how they overcome this.  Omitted from the trailers and a single blue dot as a focal point in the center of the screen which the player can use to center themselves.  The designers came across this technique from interviewing ballerinas about how they perform spins without feeling sick.  The trick is to focus on a single point.</p><p>Along with the demo, comes another spiffy trailer: <a href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19906" title="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19906">http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19906</a></p><div class='title'><b>I'm probably sold</b></div><p>The game looks sweet by I have some concerns about length of game and story.  Honestly, if the gameplay is fantastic, who cares about story.  Just as long as the story either heightens the gameplay or stays completely out of the way, I'll be fine with it.  From the demo above, it seems that the story won't be too annoying.  That scripted event at the end was kinda dumb though.</p><p>The length of the game is a concern because I don't want to pay $60 for 6 or 7 levels the same size as that demo.  I want a bunch of levels that are very unique in location from each other and offer a variety of puzzles rather than the same thing over and over again.  From impressions I've heard, it sounds like it has the variety, but I'm still concerned on the length.</p><p>So, If I were to buy the game, the question comes down to what platform do I purchase Mirror's Edge for?  Well, DICE is a PC game developer, so the lead platform has got to be windows based.  I'm thinking they'll be more concerned with that crowd over the Playstation 3, so that leaves Windows v. Xbox.  Pfft, obviously there's no way my computer is going to run this thing without crashing, so I guess I'll pick it up on Xbox.</p><p>The other little incentive to actually buying the game rather than waiting or renting it is that Gamestop is offering Faith's messenger bag as a pre-order bonus!  (via <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/09/pre-order-mirrors-edge-and-its-in-the-bag/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/09/pre-order-mirrors-edge-and-its-in-the-bag/">joystiq</a>): Available <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?Product_ID=70962" title="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?Product_ID=70962">here</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/MirrorsEdgePreOrderRunnerBag.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/MirrorsEdgePreOrderRunnerBag.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/MirrorsEdgePreOrderRunnerBag.webp" /></p><p>It looks like a very nice piece of video game swag and hides it's geeky nature quite well.  I've already got a spiffy laptop bag though, along with a secondary backpack.  I'm afraid I have no use for this thing other thing putting it in my closet next to my Adobe Max laptop bag and NFJS backpack laptop bag.</p><p>Perhaps I'll without judgment until PAX when it'll probably be on the show floor there and I can actually play it for myself.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Assassin's Creed Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/assassins-creed-impressions">Assassin's Creed Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Assassin's Creed is pretty neat, but incredibly repetitive.</p><div class='title'><b>It's neat</b></div><p>It's neat because it takes a fast paced approach to Stealth killing, compared to Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu which believe that patience is your number one weapon when killing unnoticed.  The fast paced nature comes from the Free Running style of gameplay.  Just hold down the run button and the sprint button, and off you go.  You can run up to a wall to scale it, climb on top, and then jump from roof top to roof top.</p><p>It's also neat because of the incredible scale of the cities you're free running through.  When perched on top of a tower, you can see all the buildings of the entire city.  Then you can crawl back down the tower, hop along a bunch of roof tops to the next tower, climb to the top and actually feel like you've covered a significant amount of ground.</p><p>It's also neat because with this scale, comes crowds and crowds of people.  So many people that it can become difficult to run through the streets.  You'll either need to start knocking everybody down as you bolt through them or get knocked over yourself.</p><div class='title'><b>Scale and Speed</b></div><p>The sense of the scale and speed are the greatest accomplishments of the game I've experience so far, but with scale comes the question of how you fill it?  You need a lot of stuff to make these cities feel alive, and the best way to make 10 people look like 100 is to copy and paste 10 times.  Recycle models, assets, textures and place everything in the world randomly, but come back afterwards and start molding it so it actually works.</p><p>The physics and gameplay engine are KEY for creating a game like this.  The gameplay needs to be absolutely flexible to operate correctly no matter what is actually in the environment.  Back at PAX last year, when the lead designer was demoing Assassin's Creed, he said that that was exactly their goal.  He pulled out his dev kit and set up a bunch of objects in the environment for Altier to run across and jump around on.  It was pretty fluid, like the environment was pre-setup.  But then he started moving around a bunch of the objects put them in places where Altier obviously couldn't move the same way as before.  He ran Altier through the objects again, and he acted completely different, but still completely fluid.</p><p>That's a lot of how Assassin's Creed feels when you're running across the roof tops.  You look to your left and right and look for little foot holds or nearby roof tops to jump across to.  It doesn't take long for you to figure out just how far Altier can jump and what makes sense to latch on to.  It's really fun ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Over and over again</b></div><p>Each city feels like it's been setup in certain areas, but all the recycled textures and models make me feel like I'm walking through the set of a Flintstones cartoon.  There's that guy again..  Oh! There's that doorway again.  Thank GOD you have a radar you can set waypoints onto.</p><p>On top of that, you have about 20 or 30 tasks to do per mission, which limit themselves to either helping Citizens from bully guards, pickpocketing, eavesdropping or intimidating.  Once you do all the tasks, you bring your information to the local guild and he tells you where to assassinate your target.  You go there, kill him, return to the guild and mission complete.  Then you get to do it ALL OVER AGAIN.  Rinse and repeat.</p><p>I've spent 5 hours rescuing stupid citizens and gazing from towers and hardly anytime actually assassinating worth-while targets.  I'm more focused on the grueling tasks ahead of me than any amount of story.</p><div class='title'><b>Story Telling</b></div><p>And the story telling is crap because you aren't actually Altier.  All this running around killing people is completely senseless and meaningless because in the overall plotline it is wholly unimportant.  You're actually a guy named Desmond, who is the great-graet-great-etg-earg-erae-fga-g-grandson of Altier and you relive moments of your grand pappy's life through inherited memories.</p><p>The real question of the game is why do I give two shits about Altier.  They mention that to get to the useful memories of Altier you have to start at the beginning, but seriously?! can't we just skip through all the piece of crap side missions which are the same as all the other side missions where are the same as the ACTUAL missions.  Where's the fast forward button? ..</p><p>In the 5 hours I've been playing so far, I've had about 30 minutes of story outside of Altier and as Desmond and I'm so bored, I'd rather be beating up people in the past.  They have given me absolutely no incentive to care about anything that's going on.  Even though the "Desmond goes to the Past" thing is a clear rip-off of LOST.</p><div class='title'><b>Why?</b></div><p>Why am I playing this game?  Why should I care about Desmond?  Running around through the streets and roof tops is neat.  Looking off in the distance over a massive city that I can walk every inch of is neat.  But adding those two things together is a gameplay concept, not a game.  This story is going no where fast... How long is this game anyways?  When can I quit?</p><p>Also, I like pushing over ladies with pots on their heads.  I also like punching bums right in the jaw when they ask me for change.  It's a lot of fun messing with the AI in this game because they just can't win.  Pots?  That's a pushin'  Change? That's a stabbin'<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's all melting around me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me">It's all melting around me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 15, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the mail today, Netflix graciously delivered <b>House of Wax</b>.  That 2006 piece of shit horror movie with Paris Hilton and a supporting actress.  I'm not really sure how it snuck itself all the way to first place in my queue, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through the entire thing.  To be fair, I did have the things on 1.5x Play to make sure I only wasted an hour, rather than an hour and a half.</p><p>My expectations were pretty simple..  I knew this film was garbage.  I expected garbage.  But House of Wax still managed to disappoint me and fail my expectations.</p><p>Though it did not fail my expectations as badly as Nintendo and Sony had today.  For this week is E3, the Electronics Entertainment Expo is Los Angeles.  The event that has set itself as a milestone in game development and allows companies to show what they have accomplished and what big things they have in store for gamers in the coming fall and Christmas season.</p><p>Yesterday, Microsoft had some great announcements such as a new 60 gb Xbox 360 coming out in a couple of weeks to replace the 20gb.  The harddrive expansion should help out a bit since another announcement was that you can install full Xbox 360 games onto your harddrive for far faster loading.  EVEN bigger news was that Microsoft has teamed with Netflix to stream "Watch Instantly" titles directly to your Xbox 360 if you have a Netflix subscription and an xbox live gold subscription.</p><p>They also showed off some of there games namely <b>Gears of War 2</b> (dumb) and <b>Fable 2</b> (sweet!) and ended their conference announcing that Final Fantasy XIII will be coming to the Xbox 360 in America.  This news literally broke some corners of the internet..  namely neogaf.  Squaresoft held a Q&A session afterward where everyone wanted to know the details.</p><p>The Xbox is looking quite lucrative..  Even before the conference, Fable 2 was really the only next-gen game that interested me this Fall and with the Netflix integration and new 60gb models, I'll be in line that mid-August morning to pick one up.  Hopefully there'll be some sort of sale..</p><p>That's fine for the Xbox though, but I'm MORE interested in the game consoles I own.  I've owned a Wii for well over a year now, and in the last 3 months I haven't even touched it.  There's nothing on the Wii I want to play right now, and nothing down the pipeline either.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same is with the Playstation 3.  I bought that thing about a month ago, loved Metal Gear Solid 4 to death, and now all I do with it is play DVDs and Blurays.  There's nothing on the Playstation 3 coming down the pipeline I want that I wouldn't have a better time with on the 360.  Any multi-platform titles that has a smidgen of Online functionality, I will choose the Xbox version because I have MORE friends with Xboxes and it's MUCH easier to join games with them.  <b>Ghostbusters</b> has Online co-op?  Xbox purchase.  <b>Resident Evil 5</b> has Online Co-op?  Most likely Xbox purchase.</p><p>SO, that made me quite excited for this morning when Nintendo and Sony had their E3 press conferences and I feverishly waited for a megaton announcement to rival the Final Fantasy XIII on Xbox announcement yesterday.  In fact, I popped up the live video to listen to while I worked rather than just looking at the news pouring in from sites.</p><p>The first conference of the day was Nintendo.  They showed off a snowboarding game with the Wii Balance Board, then<b> Animal Crossing</b>, then some DS games..  Then they showed off <b>Wii Sports Resort</b> (Wii Sports 2), which I thought was pretty damn important for them.  It'll definitely sell a ton of copies since everyone knows and loves Wii Sports.  I was somewhat excited for them, but for me..  who cares?  It's just another collection of Wii mini-games to go along with all the other top-selling games on the Wii.  Then they announced <b>Wii Music</b>, which was laughable.</p><p>And that was it...  Iwata mentioned that the Zelda and Mario teams are hard at work on new Wii titles, but gave absolutely no hint as to what those titles are, nor when we know of them.  All the games shown for Wii were more crappy mini-game compliations and Animal Crossing, which is an MMO chat room furniture collection game I've already played to death on the gamecube.  Frakking bullshit.</p><p>I shrugged it off though..  my Wii is kinda broken now anyways, and my monitor only accepts digital signals, so the Wii looks like crap on it.  I've been setting my sights on HiDef gaming more recently so bring on the good news Sony!</p><p>Nearly 2 hours later, the Sony conference began and I sat listening to Jack Trenton talk and talk and talk.  <b>Yakuza 2</b> (on PS2) got a little face time in the Playstation 2 trailer, which made me happy.  That's another game coming out this fall that I've been waiting for.  Trenton unveiled PSN movie rentals which was the biggest joke after Microsoft announced its Netflix partnership the day earlier.</p><p>He also announced that they have 130 titles coming to PS2 by the end of the year...  That's a lot more than they have for the Playstation 3.  Obviously the Playstation 2 has a huge attach rate, but it's time to move on.  Focus on the Playstation 3 because the Xbox hit 5 or 6 home runs just yesterday, not to mention all the blockbuster releases last year.  Metal Gear is all you have going for you and Microsoft has shown that it doesn't need it.</p><p>An hour into the conference and they finally get to showing off the upcoming games for Playstation 3.  Sony officially announces God of War 3 (boring), they show off some other game, and unveil MAG, a 256 player war simulator.  Another fucking war game...  and that's the show.</p><p>Once again, absolutely nothing that appeals to me at all..  No immersive single player experience that will have me loving video games the way Twilight Princess, Mario Galaxy and Metal Gear Solid 4 have.  Resident Evil 5 will probably fill that bill, but Sony didn't give any face time to it.  Microsoft showed off a demo and gave a March 13th, 2009 date AND announced online co-op.</p><p>The future is grim for my interest in these two consoles in the next year.  There's still whatever game the Zelda and Mario teams are working on for the Wii (<b>Kid Icarus</b>).  And there's <b>Yakuza Kenzan</b> and <b>Yakuza 3</b> for Playstation 3, but haven't been announced for an American release.</p><p>The Xbox has Fable 2 coming out in October, and huge multi-million-dollar-deal DLC for Grand Theft Auto 4.  Probably some Mass Effect DLC once Bioware finishes Dragon Age.  There's also Galaga Legions from the creators of Pacman CE.  AND Online Co-op for Ghostbusters with friends!</p><p>I really feel that once I actually get an Xbox, my other two consoles will just sit there, against the wall.. especially the Wii.  The Playstation 3 I'll use for Blu-ray and upscaling Playstation 2 games.</p><p>There's not a whole lot of redeeming qualities..  much like House of Wax.  For a horror movie, there's NO nudity.. what the crap?!  The acting goes from bad to worse to slap-in-the-face horrible.  However, in the end, the main characters set the House of Wax on fire and frantically escape as it turns into a boiling molten pit of fire and craziness.  Also, Paris Hilton dies.  House of Wax will always have that over the Nintendo and Sony conferences.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metal Gear Solid 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metal-gear-solid-4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 14, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over a month ago, Metal Gear Solid 4 was release on the Playstation and over a month ago, I played the crap out of it.  I stood outside Wal*mart early in the morning and spent the $500 entry fee for a Playstation 3 and a copy of Metal Gear.  I played a little bit in the evening after work, but on that Saturday afternoon, I picked up the controller, and didn't set it down until I finished it the next day.  I was on my seat the whole time.  I was careful, but still raced through the gameplay to watch the next cutscene.  I had to see what happened next.</p><p>So far in this generation, I haven't felt anything this.  Every game I have liked on the Xbox may have had a decent story, but the characters are all so flat and vacant.  There's no emotional appeal what-so-ever.  You kill a bunch of enemies and the story progresses, but your character never explains how he feels about it.  You never show any weakness or compassion. Enemies are merely obstacles, gameplay elements, something to do until you see what happens next..  rather than seeing how your characters will react to what happens next.</p><p>The first bit of the game shows off the next gen nature of Metal Gear 4.  It pulls in new concepts of the series and sets the stage and themes Hideo Kojima wants to make with his game.  War is ugly and the only thing pushing War is the war economy.  Nations thrive from war and it's become a way of life for some people.</p><p>The overall story in Metal Gear Solid 4 is a very human tale.  Though, it does have its fair share of ridiculousness.  Metal Gear Solid is quite serious in the themes it presents, but once the game drifts from it's commentary on modern warfare to the actual plot of the Metal Gear series, little bits of crazy start seeping into the frame work.  Metal Gear starts off as one game and becomes another.</p><p>It becomes the absolute climax of Solid Snake's story bringing up points from Snake's past and MY own past playing Snake in the previous 3 games.  Remember when you did this?  It's relevant because of this.  Remember this person you met?  They're relevant because of this.  Each game has its purpose, and although Kojima wasn't thinking about all this at the time, they all set the stage for the finale of Metal Gear Solid 4.</p><p>This is really only part of the game though. But it's the most important part to me.  The complexity of the characters and the continuous tie-ins that bleed nostalgia kept me playing for those 14 hours until the final breathe of the game.</p><p>I am completely satisfied with my $500 purchase, but that doesn't mean Metal Gear is for everyone.  With Metal Gear, I wanted a linear experience.  Most games try to strive away from linearity claiming it's a bad thing.  If you're trying the represent reality, you must branch your story into many different directions which can splinter your focus and ultimately provide a stale experience.</p><p>In Grand Theft Auto's case, the story fails because of how inconsistent the gameplay is from the story.  In the beginning, Niko is just another guy trying to make a living.  However, if you play the game the way some of my friends do and try to kill as many people as possible before the cops kill you, the story falls apart fast when you get back to it and everyone is shocked when you kill a single person.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid does a bit of hand holding and several staged events that trigger when you walk to a certain point in the area.  The game is also filled with hours of cutscenes.  Overall, my initial experience was half-gameplay / half-cutscene.  It's literally 5 3-5 hour movies in one package, with some individual cutscenes well over the hour mark..  but you can save halfway through them.  You can also skip them too, except for one or two.</p><p>The story is also very much rooted in Metal Gear Solid lore. New-comers to the Metal Gear Solid series will definitely find themselves lost in the later chapters of the game and nostalgia will just wash over them.  This game is not really targeted towards new-comers at all and I don't imagine that a new-comer will actually like it either.  The target market is really the gaming community at large.  People that know games..  That's why the gaming press awards it with perfect scores.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviews</b></div><p>I'd imagine this makes Metal Gear rather difficult for most people to review because what do you actual focus on?  The gameplay is neat.  The graphics are beautiful.  The story is neat.  The story is brilliant to gamers.  Honestly, reviews are opinions and my opinion is stated above.  That is what affected me most when playing the game and that is what matters to me.  Metal Gear Solid 4 is the best game of this generation, in my opinion, and I don't think they'll be another game to top it, but it is clearly not for a wide audience.</p><p>If you see a review of this game that is absolutely void of emotion and doesn't even mention characters, you'll know what kind of gamer the author is...  like this fantastic gem for The Isthmus, Madison's weekly newspaper:</p><p><em> This is the solo-mission game to beat this summer, and it should be regarded as a great work of art.  You equip yourself with submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, a tranquilizer gun and hanguns, and you top them off with scopes, suppressors, lazer sights and rifle grips.  You need all those guns, because the year is 2014, and you are an old hero soldier who must shoot through heavily populated battlefields in the Middle East, Africa and beyond in a very long action-adventure where villains and their expendable troops are rising up to conquer territory</em></p><p><em> There are serious issues to ponder in the plot, which depicts a world at constant war.  Characters explore literary themes of mortality, individualism, the rise of machines and interpersonal relationships</em></p><p><em> Guns of the Patriot is pretty close to a masterpiece and contains some of the most addictive gaming of 2008.  Then you go online to find the same level of artistic detail accompanying multiplayer battlefields.</em> -Doug Elfman</p><p>This is a very stoic depiction of the game that reads like the back of the box.  In this game I do this and this and this.  There are guns and some type of story.  Apparently it's a long game, so I'm getting my money's worth.  There's also a multiplayer mode, so that'll keep me going after I beat it.  This isn't a review; it's a commercial.  He goes into length to describe all the types of guns without saying that each one has a distinct feel when you fire it.  NOT ONCE does he mention it's a sneaking game NOR that you can choose to take sides in the war.</p><p>The two sentences of actual opinion states it as "a work of art" and a "masterpiece" without giving supporting facts to why it is a "work of art" and a "masterpiece".  He knows there's something to it, but he can't quite put his finger on it..  better to talk about guns and what you do in the game rather than break the barriers of gaming and discuss it AS a work of art.  You know they're there because you mention "serious issues to ponder".  Does the fact they are literary make them a "masterpiece"?</p><p>I dunno..  despite how annoying this "review" is, this is really perfect for the audience of the Isthmus.  I think everyone should definitely give Metal Gear a shot and see for themselves what others regard as a masterpiece.  If I were writing this, Should I say that this game is not for everyone?  Disclaimer: Very linear story, lots of cutscenes, and heavy references to previous 3 games.  If the local paper decided to free up a tiny little portion for a game most of their audience doesn't care about..  Would you tell the audience, "this game isn't for you"?</p><p>Well, I think I would have to include that bit, but I'd also include how it made me feel and why I thinking it's the greatest thing ever..  because describing all the guns for the bulk of the article makes it sound like every other game, which Metal Gear Solid 4 is not.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/2008-7/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
