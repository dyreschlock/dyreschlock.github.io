Episode 10 will air on Monday December 10th, followed by Episode 11 on the following Monday.  Episode 12 is placed on Wednesday December 19th at 10/9c.  Not too shabby.  (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>As that article suggested, the decision to air episode 12 came from the caring, passionate support of internet fans, namely those at <a href="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/">SaveJourneyman.net</a>.  Those involved with the site are trying to organize a "Save our Show" campaign similar to what happened with Jericho.</p><p>Earlier this year <a href="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/">Nuts Online .com</a> instituted a campaign called "Nuts for Jericho" where fans contributed money towards a daily shipment of peanuts to CBS New York.  A grand total of $56,968 was spent, totaling over 8 million peanuts.  Check it out: <a href="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho">Nuts for Jericho</a>.</p><p>And it worked!  CBS signed Jericho for a 2nd season.</p><p>It doesn't really look like SaveJourneyman.net is as organized as Nuts for Jericho, but there's plenty of time.. thanks to the strike.  Even though Life and Chuck were renewed, they still need to make those episodes..  If the strike is resolved within this next month, I wonder if they'll try to complete seasons by May..</p><p>hmm... I should probably netflix Jericho to see what all the fuss is about.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to NBC Monday Night updates" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nbc-monday-night-updates">NBC Monday Night updates</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After last week's phenomenal episode, the story continues to build to the fall season finale.  This story arc ends next week, and with that we probably won't see any new episodes of Heroes for a while, due to strike.  With the strike..  episode 11 of Heroes Season 2 is somewhat posed to be the overall season finale. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>Recanting <a href="/old/v7/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman">last week's post</a>, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter (episodes 8 and 9) .. brings big numbers."  I watched both episodes and they were quite good.  I'm almost sad to see the show go.  The plot of Journeyman is really coming together, and the fall finale (two-parter of episodes 11 and 12) bring the plot full circle as it is finally told why Dan is traveling through time.</p><p>Journeyman has 3 episodes left, but won't be airing next week.  Next week, after Heroes, that new cop-drama, Life, will air the beginning of a two-parter to end on its normal timeslot on Wednesday.  The week after is Journeyman's "Christmas episode".  The next Monday after that on December 17th, will be the first episode of the finale, episode 11.  Unfortunately, it seems that episode 12 may not even air according to <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883">Aint it Cool</a>.</p><p>After watching this past week, I'm really quite excited to see what happens, but with the numbers in the toilet, it doesn't seem like Journeyman will even gets its end aired.  But, for those fans out there, Journeyman will be released on DVD will its high-budgeted music soundtrack intact, and including all episodes. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>At this time, NBC has ordered more episodes of Life and that crappy show Chuck, through the rest of their debut seasons...  but Journeyman is still on the chopping block. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>I'd probably like Journeyman more if the episodes followed a stricter plot.  The episodes have been very episodic, giving bits and pieces of the overall plot in each episode.  I'd much rather be absorbed in the story the whole time, like in Heroes and Lost, then you can see everything in the show develop at once.. characters evolve..  plot is continuous.  You never feel like you're wasting your time watching an episode.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>In other news.... Strike</b></div><p>Some of the commercials tonight for new programming beginning in January really makes me feel like the Strike is taking its toll on programming.  Especially with a trailer for the return of <b>American Gladiators</b> to prime-time television, beginning January 7th-ish.  ugh...  I'll probably still watch the premiere episode, though..</p><p>Some good news, though..  Yet another <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897">Aint it Cool</a> article states that the strike could be resolved before Christmas.  Nice! ^_^</p><p>...and just in time for the strike ending, I got my "Support the Strike" cancer bracelets in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" /></p><p>Lemme know if you'd like a bracelet..

Since my little brother had to go back up North for school, I figured this was the perfect time to dump the car at home since they needed it.  I really didn't want it anymore since it starting acting up a couple weeks ago and it's old and I don't really want it anymore.</p><p>Despite having engine troubles, I figured it could make the 300 mile journey without a problem..  well, I was wrong about that one.  20 miles north of Wis. Dells, my front tire exploded!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" /></p><p>I've never seen a tire crap out this bad.  My little brother was behind me and said the hub cap popped square off the car and traveled parallel for a little while until it hit the ground and flew off into the ditch.</p><p>Luckily the Oldsmobile is such a boat, it never came close to flipping or skidding or anything..  I just pulled over and took pictures!  We put the spare tire on the car and traveled about 230 miles back home.</p><p>Before we left, I refueled both cars at the exact same time and reset the mileage.  What's really interesting is that the Oldsmobile registered the trip as 330 miles, whereas my new-ish car traveled a mere 305 miles.  I thought the spare looked smaller than the other tires.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, goodbye Oldsmobile, hello new car ^_^.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-impressions">Mass Effect Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I can't complain about that.</p><div class='title'><b>Goodies</b></div><p>Anywho.. here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" /></p><p>Lots and lots of Mass Effect goodness.  I got the pre-order bonus with it as well, so overall I have 1) the game, 2) 2 bonus discs with extra content, 3) an art book with pretty concept art (unlike the crappy halo 3 artbook), 4) a log book with background and information on the worlds and aliens of Mass Effect, and 5) a crappy tin box to hold everything in.  This crappy tin is far better than the Halo 3, so it's not all bad.  I'm still keeping my game in the pre-order box for easy access, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Character creation</b></div><p>When beginning Mass Effect, you have the choice of playing John Shepard, or creating your own character.  I created a custom male character and began playing the game, but I could not continue.  My dude looked like a chump..  How am I supposed to care about some guy I'd run into at a bar?  I scrapped that game and began anew with a female lead..</p><p>The character is much more solid compared to Oblivion.  The controls and customization are so loose in Oblivion, you really have to work on a character to not be Ugly.  Even the random generated characters look like crap.  Not so with Mass Effect..  You really have to work on a character to make them Ugly.</p><p>The characters look really nice, but all the guys look rather plain.  I would rather play as John Shepard, than a custom male character.  The female custom characters are pretty hot though..  The character I ended up creating looks like a young badass Captain Janeway.</p><p>Before you mess with looks, you have to choose your character's past.  You have 3 choices for childhood, and 3 choices from military past.  For childhood you can be an Earther, living on the streets, running tricks, and joining the military as a last resort (much like Captain Tylor), a Colonist, whose home was destroyed by an invading alien race (kinda like the dude in Nadesico), or Military, both parents alive and raised you while serving (kinda like every macross character).</p><p>Your 3 choices from military past are Sole Survivor, where you were the sole survivor of a failed mission, War Hero, where you have battled and lead your team victoriously, or Ruthless, where you'll win a battle at any cost.</p><p>You also choose your ailments, where it be all out gunplay, techplay or magic, or a combination of two.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>When you're out on a mission, you are shooting up evil aliens in Gears of War / Rainbox Six style.  Third person shooting and killing while commanding your team to do certain things.. like heal or attack.  Much like KOTOR, you have a party of 3.</p><p>It's pretty fun so far, but I REALLY miss the melee attack from Halo 3.  The melee attack really is the last line of defense between you and your enemy and being forced to shoot an enemy at point blank range seems unnatural now.</p><p>Oh well, I'm not supposed to let enemies that close anyways..</p><p>blah blah .. what else can I really say about the gameplay.  It's a third person shooter.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Anyways, so far, after 1 hour, the game is pretty amazing.  It's already building up its massive political story, so it should be a great time sinker.  Check it out.</p><p>Mario is also a great time sinker, but in a much different way.  The generation gap is what sets these two apart, but they are perfect examples of their genres.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Uggs" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/uggs">Uggs</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Today I made my dream come true..  I woke up early for a Sunday, curled up in a blanket and plopped myself on the couch for the better part of the day playing Super Mario Galaxy.  Sunlight peering through the blinds, everyone else asleep..  Just me, the whole rest of the day, and my game.  Quite relaxing..  and despite not getting anything remotely constructive done, it was so worth it.</p><div class='title'><b>Music</b></div><p>The music in Mario Galaxy is rather peculiar.  The game makes all attempts to be modernized and cutting edge and the music pushes what you would normally hear in a video game.  Many of the main level themes are purely orchestral and very uplifting..  The type of thing you would hear in a major film release or ballad.</p><p>These themes are majestic and inspiring...  When I enter a world that begins like this, it makes me feel like I'm playing a masterpiece..  I feel like I am the center of attention.  The music puts you on such a pedestal, that all my worldly cares disappear, and I am in the game..</p><p>Contrary to this, Mario Galaxy also features a fair amount of remixed tracks from the Nintendo and Super Nintendo Mario games..  These are mainly used in more technical and retro style levels or portions of the level.  The parts of the game that make you feel like you're playing a video game, rather than exploring the world.</p><p>Overall, though, the music is exceptional.</p><div class='title'><b>Length</b></div><p>Mario Galaxy is around the perfect length.  Currently, I have about 80 stars and 14 hours.  60 stars are required to finish the game, and I could've done that hours ago.  But, through taking my time and enjoying myself, 14 hours is probably the average time it would take.</p><p>Replay has always been great for Mario games.  The amount of hidden stars, hidden levels, and hidden other stuff makes the game twice as long.  As with previous Mario games, you need 60 stars to beat the game out of 120 stars total.</p><div class='title'><b>Star layout</b></div><p>I'm finding it extremely easy to find all the hidden stuff.  Overall, there are 15 actual levels that contain 6 stars each.  Each level lays out 3 stars for you.  Another star is hidden in one of these 3 layouts.  Beyond that you have 2 comet stars.  1 is a purple coin star, where you must collect 100 purple in the level, and the other is a 'status' effect on the world.</p><p>This status effect will be one of four different types.  Either a speed run, a race against a ghost time, or fighting a boss without getting hurt.  The game said there were 4 types, but I haven't run into any ones other than these.</p><p>After getting 10 or 15 stars, the 'status' comets will begin to appear, and after you beat the game the purple coin comets begin to appear.</p><p>The main levels of the game only account for a total of 90 stars.  Through the observatory, you'll find other one-shot levels with stars in them.  These are usually really technical platforming puzzles, or some other weird gameplay mechanic.  Large boss fights are also one-shots, which usually involve fighting Bowser or Bowser Jr.</p><p>Also, hidden throughout the game, are 3 green stars which will open up a few more one-shot worlds.  There's also a hidden red star, which will unlock Mario's flight powerup in certain levels.</p><div class='title'><b>Hidden is not so hidden</b></div><p>From the layout of the game, finding the "hidden" stuff, really isn't that difficult at all.  The game basically hands you 5 out of 6 stars on a plate and the game sometimes hints to you where the "hidden" star is in the world too.  At some point, you rescue Luigi and he goes into worlds and finds 3 of the hidden stars for you.</p><p>You still need to find the hidden star on your own, but it's really not all that difficult with the linear layout of most levels.  Just keep your eyes peeled and always take the path less traveled.  Eventually the star or the method to get the star will come clear.</p><p>I don't see the next 40 stars I need to complete the game being much trouble at all.  I haven't even gone to 5 whole worlds yet..  that's 30 stars right there.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>I would say Mario Galaxy is all that difficult..  nor would I say its too easy.  I die quite a bit in the game, but it doesn't really keep me from beating levels and killing bosses.  I usually die because I fail a challenge that the game presents me.. or I screw something up.  The game really gives you a chance to grow against the challenge rather than he hindered by it or bored by it.</p><p>I'm never really overwhelmed or underwhelmed with trying to play the game.  Of course, I'm only 66% through the full game at the moment..  The real challenges lie at the end of the game and I can't wait to try them out.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, i think Mario Galaxy is excellent.  Honestly, I don't think you could make a game that could describe excellence in video gaming better than this.  Mario Galaxy works on so many levels, and is the perfect game to reach all demographics, ages, and genders.</p><p>But..</p><p>Mario does not move me.  When I play Mario Galaxy, I feel like I, the player, am center stage..  Not Mario.  Mario is just a character, running around worlds collecting stars to save the princess.  There is no emotional attachment to anything in the game.  It's all about playing the game..  Therefore I feel like my money would be better spent on something else..</p><p>:shrugs: i dunno...<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Mario Galaxy Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">Super Mario Galaxy Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>After calling several times yesterday and today, Toys R Us finally got their copy of Super Mario Galaxy, so I went there right after work to pick up my copy.  As mentioned <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-hype" title="/super-mario-galaxy-hype" title="/super-mario-galaxy-hype">previously</a>, I choose Toys R Us as my pre-order location because they offered a $25 gift card with purchase.  To my happy surprise, not only did they offer the $25, but they also had the official pre-order bonus too!</p><p>Booya!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" /></p><p>The official pre-order bonus is a commemorative coin in a DVD sized package.  The coin isn't all that cheap either.  It feels like pewter, or something..  It has a lot of weight and mass to it though, so it's not going to fall apart.  The yellow colored in star is kind cheap though..</p><div class='title'><b>Game setup</b></div><p>I made sure Tony was home before putting the game into the Wii and beginning my journey into the star kingdom.  Before playing the game, I was instructed to update my Wii to the current firmware, which is rather interesting.</p><p>The Wii had an firmware update the other day, but I was unable to update my Wii because of networking issues.  Still unable to reach the internet, my Wii was able to update using the Super Mario Galaxy disc instead.  Is this the first Wii title to force you to upgrade to the current firmware?</p><p>This is quite similar to PSP games, which contain the most recent version of the firmware you need in order to play the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>Anyways, after upgrading and restarting, I was in.  The game begins with a fair amount of cutscenes and a hint of story.  Quite similar to Mario Sunshine, where the first 20 minutes is moving and viewing through the introduction of the game.  Once the story is set, and the rules are laid out off you go into the game.</p><p>The game laid out exactly the same as Mario 64 and Mario sunshine.  In Mario 64, you move around the castle to find levels.  In Mario Sunshine, you move around the island to find levels.  In Mario Galaxy, you move around the floaty space thingy to find levels.  On this space station are observatories you can access other galaxies which contain the stars you need to collect.</p><p>So far, the space station feels very limited compared to the Mario 64 Castle or the Mario Sunshine Island.  In the previous 2 games, there were many nooks and crannies to find hidden items, levels and stars..  but, I'm really not that far at all.  As you collect more stars in Galaxy, more parts of the space station are available.</p><p>Another thing that really bothers me about Galaxy thus far are the level layouts.  So far, each level has been incredibly linear.  You move from one floating part of the level to the next with no in-betwen.  You don't have that absolute freedom you had with Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine.  With those games you could go anywhere in the level.  With Galaxy, you can only move to places that have a warp.  It puts a damper on the whole 3D Mario theme.</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>Before touching this game, I was quite concerned with how a 3D platformer would operate with the Wii-mote.  Especially the lack of a right-analog stick which has really become the standard for operating the camera.  Also, platformers are designed for a traditional controller.  You don't need fancy motion controls when you're simply trying to move about the stage.</p><p>Besides that, the two-handed controller provides the extra amount of stability to keep the joystick steady and stationary.  A one-handed joystick without any stability makes it very difficult to move precisely where you want to.</p><p>So far, my fears have been somewhat realized.  The lack of camera controls is annoying as hell, but the floaty camera isn't too bad.  It will face in the direction you want to look at nearly all the time, and will correct itself fast enough that it doesn't piss you off.  They do provide a first-person camera view too, if you want to look around the level.</p><div class='title'><b>Annoying controls</b></div><p>Movement has been hit or miss with me.  Jumping is the number one thing you must nail down for the platforming genre.  If you can't jump and land with precision than the gameplay gets in the way of what you want to do.  You begin fighting with the game more than the challenges it presents.</p><p>When presented with Jumping puzzles in Mario Galaxy, I feel like I'm fighting with the controls about half of the time.  This is combination of problems with the camera angle and joystick angle.</p><p>In Mario Galaxy, you are moving around clusters of objects in 3D space, most of which are spherical.  Running down the side of a sphere in space won't move the camera, it'll keep itself centered on you as you begin to run around upside down.  Jumping onto enemies is a pain in the ass, when the camera doesn't give you an angle to correctly view the action.  I, generally, have to guess where the enemy will be and hope I land there.</p><p>One-handed movement is what I really dread about this game.  With a two-handed controller, it's pretty easy to know which direction is precisely left or precisely right.  With the one-handed nun-chuck, you don't have the stability and relative position of your other hand to tell your brain which way angle left is precisely 90 degrees to the left.  It's relative to the position of the C-button underneath your fore-finger.</p><p>meh...  maybe I'm just being to cynical.</p><div class='title'><b>That warm feeling</b></div><p>Despite those annoyances, it's still retains that beautiful awe feeling of a true Nintendo developed game.  Starting my game on a Tuesday night in the middle of a busy work week doesn't give Mario Galaxy justice.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, I wish I had begun playing on a holiday, like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  A day where you have no responsibilities..  All you have is a full day and Mario in your Wii.  I could play this game for hours upon hours.</p><p>That last game that made me feel this way was Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  I began playing that game on New Years day around 8 or 9 in the morning, and I didn't put the controller down until 10pm.</p><p>It's that cheery Christmas feeling of having a beautiful, fun and massive game and all the time in the world to play it. ^_^</p><p>That's the feeling I get when playing Mario Galaxy..  Unfortunately, my weeknights are short, so I only made it through the first collection of levels at the 2 hour mark.</p><div class='title'><b>My Advice</b></div><p>If you have a Wii, definitely pick up Mario Galaxy, but don't start playing it just yet..  Through the next week, find a copy and hold on to it.  Refrain from cracking the seal until Thanksgiving Day, or the day after Thanksgiving.  Give yourself the entire day to play Mario Galaxy, because once you begin playing, you won't want to stop.</p><p>Crawl out of bed that morning in your pajamas.  Drag a blanket into the living room and just veg out all day.  Relive your days as a spunky youngster with the days off from school and no responsibilities, and play that game from dawn to dusk ^_^</p><p>That's probably what I'll be doing this coming Sunday..  unless my roommate sequesters the TV for football :/<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 - Bullet Witch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-bullet-witch">Xbox 360 - Bullet Witch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I remember seeing ads all over Japan last fall for Bullet Witch and I wrote it off immediately as another piece of crap Japanese action game trying to pull the Japanese in the Xbox space.</p><p>It has everything the Japanese could ask for..  1) Hot female lead character wearing scantly clad outfits, and 2) putting that character in a position of kicking ass.  The sad solemn facade of main character, Alicia draws Japanese men to the flame.  She wears all black Gothic clothes.  She is unconcerning, cool, and never smiles..  wouldn't you like to be the one to melt her heart?</p><p>The title, Bullet Witch, can easily be explained by how you kill enemies..  either with your massive gun, or using magical spells.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story</b></div><p>When you play a Japanese FPS game, you definitely aren't playing it for the gameplay..  You either play it because you like the characters and/or you like the story.</p><p>Bullet Witch takes place in the year 2013, well after most of the world's population has been killed, diseased or exterminated.  Beginning in 2004, nations began to war with each other eventually leading to nuclear and biological attacks..  50% of the world's population had died by 2010 when a devastating virus ravages another billion.  In 2012-ish, a new foe emerges on earth..  hordes of demons crawl out from the ground and begin tearing apart the human race.</p><p>The year is now 2013, and a woman in black has been seen saving humans and killing demons.</p><p>The game starts at this point..  You are given a fair amount of the world's background, but nothing is said about the character you play.  Alicia appears at a point and you begin killing zombie demons.  You have a demonic voice in your head too, but that's never explained.</p><p>As you continue to fight into the city, you meet with a group of humans resisting the demons.  Leading this group is commander Michaels, who bears a striking resemblance to Bill Raiser of Neo Contra (and other contra games) fame.</p><div class='title'><b>Level Design</b></div><p>This basic gameplay and plot devices have you running around levels and killing demons in a very arcade manor.  Hordes of enemies come running and shooting after you, and you take that down with your guns and magics.</p><p>Each stage is basically a massive arena that is split up into a linear maze thanks to Walnut Heads.    Walnut heads create a force field preventing you from advancing into further areas of your level.  They are enemies that float 20-30 feet in the air using their massive car-sized brains.  The term walnut head is coined because the brain looks like a walnut.  To kill these assholes, just fire away at them and eventually they explode into a cloud a blood and guts.</p><p>Walnut heads may seem rather weak, but there are some that use their massive brain powers to pick up cars, buses and trucks to protect themselves and attack by hurling them at you.  Directly getting hit by a flying car of fire will result in your instant death, so be careful.</p><p>Once you unravel the maze and make it to the end, sometimes you'll fight a boss.  In fact, I think they are only 2 actual boss fights in the game, out of the 6 levels.</p><div class='title'><b>B-movie-tastic!</b></div><p>What I love most about Bullet Witch is the derivative story, corny dialogue, weird enemies and ridiculous boss fights.</p><p>The giant brain floating guys are pretty wicked and seeing them erupt into splash of blood and guts is neat, but my favorite enemy are the Screamers.  Screamers look like a big pile of flesh with 5 or 6 tiny legs popping out of bottom and wearing a wig.  These fellas send out grunge spirits which will possess nearby humans and turn their bodies into ravenous, large headed freaks who quickly scurry  along the ground at you.</p><p>They first appear in the airport level where you hijack a plane in an attempt to fly to the source of evil in the country.  They aren't too difficult to kill, but if you don't kill them fast enough, all of the civilians and your army crew will be turned into bone sucking demons you can't get away from.</p><p>The airport level was really the climax of the game for me.  After killing all the walnut heads, boarding the 747, and taking off into the moonlit sky..  you are under attack!  A massive flying demon beast with a body made of eyeballs pops out from the cloud cover and is heading straight for your plane.</p><p>Alicia saves the day, but kicking open the outer hatch and climbing on to the top of the 747 at 10,000 feet in the air.  Shooting the massive beast does no damage.  The eyeballs from its body pull out of their sockets and fly through the air onto your craft.  The eyes latch onto the plane and begin eating away at its surface.</p><p>You must use your devastating lightning attack against the huge beast, while dodging and shooting off the eye balls tearing your plane apart.</p><div class='title'><b>So close..</b></div><p>This seriously rivals the cheesiness of Neo Contra, while trying to keep things in the realm of reality.  I think that's what really holds this game back, aside from its technical flaws: pisspoor gameplay, not enough enemy variety, and shotty graphics.</p><p>When fighting on the plane, I was truly enjoying myself, but I never reclaimed that joy after the plane crashed landed and I was in the jungle for nearly the rest of the game.  The final level was the exact same as the second level in the city.</p><p>In chapter 3, up on the plane, you have your massive get-a-way from the evils in civilization, but out in the woods closing in on the source, you lose that attachment to society.  You lose that post-apocolyptic thought that society is screwed... and there's no perversion of earth to show you are diving into the belly of the beast.</p><div class='title'><b>Lineage</b></div><p>While playing Bullet Witch it feels a lot like some other games I've played.  Neo Contra definitely comes to mind, also it kinda reminds me of Nightmare Creatures for Playstation.  The enemies also remind me of Doom and Quake, but there were some other bits and pieces that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  After looking up the development team, and their past works it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Before 2005, Cavia (developer of Bullet Witch) was a freelance game development company.  They made games for a variety of publishers, mostly anime licensed crap, but another game that has touched my heart..  Drag-on Dragoon, known in the states as Drakengard.</p><p>Read my impressions of Drag-on Dragoon from the past: <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions" title="/drakengard-impressions" title="/drakengard-impressions">May 22nd, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-2" title="/drakengard-impressions-2" title="/drakengard-impressions-2">May 27th, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-3" title="/drakengard-impressions-3" title="/drakengard-impressions-3">June 1st, 2004</a>, and <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-4" title="/drakengard-impressions-4" title="/drakengard-impressions-4">June 6th, 2004</a>.  ah, good times.  I played this game quite a bit in Platteville when I was moving out of the SPAMM haus and into 45 Bonson st.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bullet Witch doesn't reach the level of craziness Drag-on Dragoon pushed games, but it still holds some of the lineage... especially with the Screamers.</p><p>Man, that reminds me.. I still need to play Drag-on Dragoon 2..  That game is sitting in my PS2 TODO pile.</p><div class='title'><b>Content Selection: Restricted Downloadable Content</b></div><p>There's one other thing I wish to mention, and that is something I haven't seen in any other Xbox 360 game: the notion of restricted downloadable content.  Once you beat Bullet Witch, you are given a new menu option labeled Content Selection, in this menu you can download bite-size arcade levels for 25 cents each, or download new costumes for Alicia at the price of free.</p><p>You can't reach this downloadable content any other way than through this menu in the game.  You cannot go to the Xbox live marketplace to download this stuff, and you can't queue these downloads either.</p><p>Once in this menu, you click to download something and it'll pop up your xbox download hub and keep you there until whatever you are downloading is finished.  If you leave this menu, the download is instantly canceled.</p><p>There's even a little lock on the content manager when you select to download something.  Weird, huh?  I've never heard of any Xbox game do this before.</p><p>I downloaded all the costumes because why the hell not, but I may go back and pick up some of the arcade levels.  If anything, it's a good way to get rid of an extra 20 microsoft points here and there.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>Despite my praise in several segments of the game, and actually liking it quite a bit, the fact remains that this game is quite poor.  I've known an FPS to be this inaccurate and full of stupid gameplay devices try to pull it away from the FPS genre.  It's an FPS trying to be something different, and that doesn't work at all.  It's probably better to label this as an adventure game, but that's not right either.</p><p>Aside from Alicia and Bill Raiser, the graphics are sub-par.  It looks like it was originally a PS2 game, but they redid a few of the prominent models for the next-gen platform.</p><p>But I don't really care..  It's a crappy game that has some great B-movie moments.</p><p>If you found this game for $10 and didn't have anything else to spend your money on, I'd say go for it.  It's a good way to spend a lazy sunday. Ps.. I bought Bullet Witch for $20 at pre-played.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/2007-11/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
