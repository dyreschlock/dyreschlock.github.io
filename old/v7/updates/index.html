| February 4, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 25 years, I've been taking photos and displaying them online, here. In fact, displaying my artwork was the original purpose for creating my website in the first place. Over time, the purpose of my website changed. Photography became more important to me than artwork. Then, writing more focused content became more important.</p><p>I continue to take a lot of photos with my digital camera, but those photos are all attached to posts and only viewable at the bottoms of those pages. My writing is always put first.</p><p>So, I've made a page that puts my photos first: the <a href="/photo" title="/photo">Photo Collage Page</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="/photo" title="/photo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From here, you can view all the photos I've marked as important or significant. You can click into them and view the corresponding post if it's available, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Diamond Grid Photos</b></div><p>The photos on the Photo page have been individually selected by me, after sifting through most of the over 20,000 images available on the site. While going through photos, I noticed there were many photo galleries in the directory that didn't have blog posts associated with them. Over time, I will add these posts to the site with the attached images.</p><p>I have already added a few of these posts. In particular, I added 2 major clusters of posts. The first cluster was my 2011 trip to Japan with my brother. We traveled around the Kansai region going to Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and few other cities. The second cluster was my 2014 trip to Okinawa. I visited many war sites and met up with my friend Justin while he was stationed there.</p><p>These posts are all back dated to when they took place. You can find them through the archive page from <a href="/archive/2011/6" title="/archive/2011/6">June 2011</a> and <a href="/archive/2014/7" title="/archive/2014/7">July 2014</a>.</p><p>Because of these past posts, I have now surpassed 1000 blog entries on the site.</p><div class='title'><b>Single Photos</b></div><p>One of the pages I had on a previous version of my site showed off random photos of mine without any real context. These were singular photos that I thought looked nice, so I wanted to those photos on this page too. So, I added a new photo folder on the backend for single photos.</p><p>I still continue to take random photos with my camera or my phone when I'm walking around, so I'll continue to add nice looking photos to the Photo page as time goes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Updates</b></div><p>To match the diamond grid motif, image galleries on posts also have the diamond grid, replacing the original square grid. I might add more 45 degree angles in other places, too, to have more things match. We'll see, though. Keeping things simple around here is still important.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Site Design History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/site-design-history">Site Design History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 1, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's weird to think, but this year marks 25 years of having some form of Internet home page. It all started with Geocities as a portfolio showcasing work from art school. Then, my site moved to Tripod where I tried making a web comic. And then to its home here at theschlock.com posting game reviews and photos.</p><p>Lately, I came across some of my old pages, and I wanted to find a way to surface them again. The actual content is too personal (or problematic), so I couldn't surface the pages in their original form, so I decided to reuse the old designs with all the posts currently available on the site. </p><p>Prior to the current version of the site, I would count 8 distinct versions of my home pages over 4 clear eras of experimentation and learning. FYI, not all the links on these pages are available.</p><p><u>Geocities Era</u> / Microsoft Frontpage<br/>Version 0 - <b>Art Portfolio</b> (2000, or 1999?)</p><p><u>Tripod Era</u> / Microsoft Frontpage<br/><a href="/old/v1" title="/old/v1">Version 1</a> - <b>Original Version</b> (June 12th 2000 - April 2002)<br/><a href="/old/v2" title="/old/v2">Version 2</a> - <b>Updated Version</b> (April 2002 - January 2003)</p><p><u>Domain Era</u> / Macromedia Dreamweaver<br/><a href="/old/v3" title="/old/v3">Version 3</a> - <b>Experimental Photo Version</b> (January 2003 - February 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v4" title="/old/v4">Version 4</a> - <b>Clean Photo Version</b> (February 2003 - August 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v5" title="/old/v5">Version 5</a> - <b>Framed Photo Version</b> (August 2003 - June 2005)<br/><a href="/old/v6" title="/old/v6">Version 6</a> - <b>Movable Type</b> (August 2003 - August 2006)</p><p><u>Wordpress Era</u><br/><a href="/old/v7" title="/old/v7">Version 7</a> - <b>Wordpress</b> (August 2006 - March 2014)</p><p><u>Current Era</u><br/><a href="/site-design-history" title="/site-design-history">Version 8</a> - <b>Tapestry / Java</b> (March 2014 - present)</p><div class='title'><b>Origins</b></div><p>The Internet was an absolute marvel to me. Everyone was spreading out on the net and carving their own corner of it for themselves. Everyone had their own website for their art, for their stupid movies, for their forums, for their ideas. I was in art school, so I wanted to be like all the other artists online, showcasing their stuff. Too bad I was a terrible artist.</p><p>I had no idea how to actual make a webpage. I don't remember the details, but it seems like I downloaded Microsoft Frontpage, which generated the code of my original pages, and put together a design based on other pages I liked. Geocities and Tripod offered free hosting, so I put it there and linked to other people's pages.</p><p>Version 0 - <b>Art Portfolio</b> (Geocities, 2000)<br/><a href="/old/v1" title="/old/v1">Version 1</a> - <b>Original Version</b> (June 12th 2000 - April 2002)<br/><a href="/old/v2" title="/old/v2">Version 2</a> - <b>Updated Version</b> (April 2002 - January 2003)</p><p>(Note: I am unable to retrieve any Geocities data at this time, so I'll try to revisit it later.)</p><div class='title'><b>Domain</b></div><p>After art school, I went to a real school and started learning programming. I started meeting more people who also cared about making an online presence for themselves.</p><p>November 2002 was when I bought theschlock.com. Also, for that Christmas, I got my first digital camera, and starting taking tons of photos. I wanted to make a site that used my photography more in its design and showcased photos. I started going to more clubs, and wanted to put those photos online, too. I started thinking about having a multipage design, rather than a single landing page with links.</p><p>I found Macromedia Dreamweaver online which was WAY more user friendly than Frontpage. I could actually edit things in a design view and move them around. It gave me more freedom. This really helped me develop a sense of web-design. I still had yet to fully understand HTML, but Dreamweaver had both design views and code views, so I could watch the code change as I moved things around. After a while, I could take off the training wheels and write the code myself.</p><p><a href="/old/v3" title="/old/v3">Version 3</a> - <b>Experimental Photo Version</b> (January 2003 - February 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v4" title="/old/v4">Version 4</a> - <b>Clean Photo Version</b> (February 2003 - August 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v5" title="/old/v5">Version 5</a> - <b>Framed Photo Version</b> (August 2003 - June 2005)</p><p>I messed around with some designs and eventually landed on the last one. </p><div class='title'><b>Blogs</b></div><p>By the time I landed on that last design, I was living with friends and fellow students who were in web development at school. They also made their own websites, and quite knowledgable about all things Internet. Blogging software started becoming an actual business, and people had begun transitioning from completely custom hobbyist sites into Blogs.</p><p>Technology had changed too. Making website updates was no longer about directly editing HTML and uploading it. The underlying database would hold all the data, and software running on the server would generate the page. I didn't fully understand this. I had really only just grasped the top layer of web-dev.</p><p>One of my friends loved Movable Type, so I installed it on theschlock.com from his recommendation. I used it in tandem with the Framed version of the site. Moveable Type would handle all the long posts about games and whatever. The Framed version was updated with photos and pictorials.</p><p><a href="/old/v6" title="/old/v6">Version 6</a> - <b>Movable Type</b> (August 2003 - August 2006)</p><p>I used this site through the remainder of college.</p><div class='title'><b>Wordpress</b></div><p>Nearing the end of college, the Internet and blogging had matured. My site design was pretty "old" for the Internet and MovableType wasn't totally user-friendly to use. By then, Wordpress completely overtook all of independent blogging. </p><p>Prior to studying abroad in Japan, I downloaded my entire site locally and zipped it. I installed Wordpress on theschlock.com, which completely took over. Wordpress was WAY more user friendly than Movable Type, and I could easily write about everything I was doing in Japan, and show all my photos, too.</p><p><a href="/old/v7" title="/old/v7">Version 7</a> - <b>Wordpress</b> (August 2006 - March 2014)</p><p>I choose the design from a template, but then changed it slightly to be different. Not all that much, though.</p><p>After graduating, I still continued to use it. Working as a developer, I learned so much about using Java to manage and maintain websites, but I never had the headspace to use it on any personal projects. I had the time, but I already spent all day thinking about websites at work. I needed to decompress at home.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Version</b></div><p>That brings us to the current version of the site. </p><p>While Wordpress was far more user-friendly than my previous versions, it didn't feel special. It didn't feel like it was mine. Wordpress used PHP at the time, which I never liked. PHP feel far too loose and I couldn't understand it.</p><p>I had always wanted to remake everything from scratch and have complete control over everything on the site in a more modern capacity. I had started laying some initial groundwork in 2012. But then, after moving to Japan and settling in, I finally had the headspace to execute on my ideas completely. I knew exactly what I wanted and exactly how to make what I wanted.</p><p>I wrote about all this in the first post on this version of the site on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th, 2014</a> as the site went live for the first time. Around 2 months later, the full design was complete. I wrote about that <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start-2" title="/a-fresh-start-2">here</a>.</p><p><a href="/site-design-history" title="/site-design-history">Version 8</a> - <b>Current</b> (March 2014 - now)</p><p>It was the site I had always wanted. I had complete control over everything on the site, and it was extensible enough to have new things over time.</p><p>Running an active website isn't all that easy, though. It was always going down after a couple of days. I kept up with it for nearly 3 years. Then, one day, when I checked on it, the site was gone. Deleted from my host. My host had dropped support, so that was the end of that service.</p><p>2 years ago, with renewed programming interest, I finally brought the site back online, nearly 9 years after its initial launch. I posted about it on <a href="/old/v7/website-revival" title="/website-revival">March 9th 2023</a>.</p><p>Now, the online version of my site is a generated mess of static HTML files. Because of this, there should no longer ever be any problems with hosting in the future. There's nothing running on the host, nor any database it's pulling from. It is free from any technical problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>This design has changed and been refined a little bit over the years, but I doubt there will ever be another complete redesign of the site. The design still holds all the key values I want for written online content, and it's easy for me to add new things and change them.</p><p>Although...  Now that I have a framework for displaying my blogging content with different designs, I could experiment with new designs and see if anything sticks. Or, I could design terrible versions of my site in the same way that much of the blogging sites have turned into.</p><p>Revisiting many of these old pages has given me some new ideas, too, so stay tuned. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Today's Posts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/todays-posts">Today's Posts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the Spring of 2014, I had finally built the website I had always wanted. Using the Tapestry framework and my web development experience, I wrote a site that could host all of my blog content I had written over the years and be extensible enough to easily change and build whatever I wanted into it. </p><p>I wasn’t manually building pages anymore, like I had been when I first made my website in 2003. My blog content wasn’t orphaned on another server, like when I moved to Movable Type in 2005. And, I was no longer stuck within the constraints of someone else’s design, like when I moved to Wordpress in 2006. </p><p>With my new website, I had built everything from scratch, which gave me complete full control over everything, which gave me the freedom to do anything. It was perfect.</p><p>Almost, anyways.</p><p>Tapestry is a very powerful framework, but for my particular setup at the time, it often crashed. Tapestry ran in Java, so to deploy the site on the Internet, it needed to be run in Tomcat. Once running Tomcat would serve the pages to whomever requested them. But, every two or three days, something within Tapestry or Tomcat would cause the site to be unresponsive. To fix this, I would turn it off and turn it back on again. Not a lot of people actually visited my site, so I don’t think anyone noticed.</p><p>For almost three years, things were pretty good. Though, as usual, my posting became less frequent and I stopped visiting my site as often as before. One day, when I power cycled my website, it was gone. There was nothing on my server. Apparently, a month or two prior, my web server had failed its migration. Well, whatever. All of my code was a mirror of what I had locally. I’ll just copy everything over again and start it up. Not so. My web server had also dropped Java and Tomcat support after this migration. No word about this at all. They just deleted all of my stuff, dropped support, but still billed me every month.</p><p>I looked around a little bit for a new web server. I tried one service, but I couldn’t get the site running. I continued to look around, but Tomcat support had become expensive for some reason. Maybe demand had dropped. I had thought about using cloud servers with Google which would homogenize my Internet eco-system further, but that was also more expensive that what I wanted. Also, it took me a while to figure out how to do it, and I was getting no where.</p><p>So, the site was dead.</p><p>In the last couple of months, I have been doing a lot of programming and using GitHub thanks to the Analogue Pocket. One day I saw that someone had “hosted” their blog on Github. Looking further, you could also have your web domain point to these pages and mask itself as a real website. </p><p>Oh shit. Could I do this?</p><p>GitHub is not a webserver, so it can’t run anything on the backend. Any webpage it hosts, would have to be static. Despite my website running Tapestry, almost all of my content is static. Yes, it uses a database, and Yes, the server is generating pages. But, the result is always the same. Anything that was dynamically generated from the server, could be changed to a separate page or rewritten in Javascript.</p><p>I had often thought that if I could simply make my website a huge mess of HTML pages, then I could easily find hosting and it would absolutely never crash or be inaccessible. And GitHub was answer, because not only could it host these html pages, but it could do it for free.</p><p>It didn’t take me long to find the command line program, WGET. When run, it will crawl through a website and save everything locally. It didn’t take me long to write a <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh">terminal script</a> to save my entire website in HTML into a GitHub directory that could push back to the Github to be hosted.</p><p>There were still some broken links, dynamic links that needed to be changed, and the image gallery that needed to be re-written. A few weeks later, those were all solved. I cleaned up some old posts, and removed some problematic ones from 15+ years ago. I'm also hosting images directly from Google Drive. Now, I’ve written a few new posts to cover some topics from the last year. There are still some posts that I haven't written yet. You can see that progress <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2">on GitHub</a>. I even made a custom <a href="/errorpage" title="/errorpage">error page</a>!</p><p>I think everything is good enough to consider my website reopened. :)</p><p>I first opened theschlock.com in August of 2003, so in just a few more months, it'll be the 20-year anniversary. My life has changed considerably since then, from college, to studying abroad, to working as a software developer, to moving to Japan and working in public schools, to now working in a private school.

This is to ensure that the cars are still safe to drive and that they haven't been illegally modified. It's usually costs at least $1000, which is annoying, but it's even more annoying when you have a bunch of repair costs tacked on top of it.</p><p>When I arrived in Japan, I had to buy a car because public transportation up in the mountains was not feasible. The car mechanic in town had a pretty good deal on a 2004 <b>Subaru R2</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Subaru R2 is a Kei car, denoted by its yellow plate. Kei cars are smaller and have smaller engines. This also means they get some pretty great gas mileage.  I bought the car in 2013, but as <I>Shaken</I> loomed in 2021, the bottom plating had begun to erode away and it was no longer road-worthy. My mechanic information me that the repairs would be too much, and I should buy a new car. I had a bunch of money saved up from stimulus checks and not traveling due to lockdown, so it wasn't too bad.</p><p>My mechanic and I went through a bunch of cars on the open market, and I finally settled on a 2017 <b>Daihatsu Mira ES</b>. I wanted to continue owning a Subaru, but they discontinued their line of Kei cars, and Daihatsu has purchased their designs. The Mira is a slight evolution of the R2 mixed with Daihatsu designs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I went with Red to try and set myself apart from the conformity of all the White, Off-White, and Grey cars of Japan. Nobody likes colors in their cars over here. It's still not completely unique, though, as the Mira ES is one of the most popular Kei cars on the road. I think that's good because it'll be easy to find replacement parts in the future if stuff breaks. Also the mechanic can easily figure out how to fix it.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and I've finally made the final payment on my car. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Car Mileage</b></div><p>Whenever I pay for gas, I've gotten in the habit of writing down the Odometer on the receipt in order to calculate my own gas mileage. These receipts pile up, and I eventually take all of the data and enter it into spreadsheets in Google Drive.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0419_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0134.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0134.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0134_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0134_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0134_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Those are both a year's worth of receipts. One pile is from 2020. The other pile is from 2022.</p><p>Over the 8 years I owned my Subaru R2, I drove it 105,000 kilometers. I took some roadtrips to Hiroshima, Kyoto, and Chiba. Many times I drove to Tokyo, too. Throughout its life, it had an average of 32.93 or 33.67 mpg, after conversions from liters and km. Towards the end, it started losing some of its mpg, and after Covid started, I was really only driving around town.</p><p>Here are the full stats on my <b>Subaru R2</b>:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEUeqESvioxxYmGwsYPkDsx453hCRjZDRJQlesGGBvI" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEUeqESvioxxYmGwsYPkDsx453hCRjZDRJQlesGGBvI">Google Sheets</a></p><p>I have continued to do gas accounting with my <b>Daihatsu Mira ES</b>.

In fact, if you wanted to go further with it, the exchange rate for Yen to Dollars tanked after the war started. If you convert this to dollars, I paid $881 in 2021 and only $792 in 2022.

| April 27, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About 2 months, I started working on a dream of mine.  A dream that I've had for many many years.  Throughout those years, I had many ideas, wants and desires, but never had the motivation to put them into code.</p><p>2 months ago, in the midst of finalizing classes for the year, and being monstrously busy with all kinds of nonsense, I had the urge to put this together.  Everything was so clear in my head.</p><p>It's one of those moments, where you feel the weight of your To-Do list, and just can't bring yourself to do anything on it.  That moment when your mind wonders, and you think about something else you could be doing.  Something equally constructive, but way more fun.  For that day, I didn't want to do anymore lesson planning, and I missed Software Development enough.</p><p>At that moment, it was time for me to finally do this.</p><p>It was time to finally rewrite theschlock.com as its own application with all of my own code, and design.</p><p>And on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th</a>, the new theschlock.com was running on line for the first time.  Today, it's finally (basically) finished!</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>2 years prior, I had already created a Tapestry 5 project that ran in Jetty completely standalone from anything I had at Widen.  And I had things already organized for where I wanted to start adding classes.  </p><p>From the beginning, I knew that I wanted to write this site in Java using Tapestry 5 and Hibernate.  They were technologies I was used to.  Much of the work I did at Widen was on the backs of others smarter than me that had already built systems for others to use.  I wanted to learn how to use these technologies from scratch to better understand how they work.</p><div class='title'><b>Code Decisions</b></div><p>On the back end, there were several other decisions that I had made WELL before any code was written.</p><p>1.  This site will not have comments.  </p><p>At least, nothing internal.  I learned a long time ago from MovableType and Wordpress that any web form left unattended will get massively spammed by bots, and who knows what else.  (In the future, I might add Facebook comments if I can fit them into the design.)</p><p>2.  Further than that!  This site will only have read access to the database.</p><p>I did not want to deal with security in any manor for this site.  Nothing on the Internet is every truly secure, and anyone who would want to tear into my database has way more time, and expertise on their side.  Any wall is just an invitation, so why have any walls in the first place.  And, if I did have security, I would probably just mess it up.</p><div class='title'><b>Road Blocks</b></div><p>In any project, you'll hit a road block.  You'll come across something you don't understand, or a problem you just can't figure out.</p><p>When it's a personal project, it is very easy to just call it quits.  You're the only person on the project, and you are really the only person that cares about the outcome.  If you call it quit, it really only affects you.</p><p>Maybe it's been all those years at Widen dealing with road blocks on a daily basis, or maybe I'm just more comfortable with writing code than I was in college, or maybe I'm just more grown up now, too, and experienced.</p><p>Any road blocks I came across with this project were eventually overcome.  Any problem, or misunderstanding just took a little bit of patience, time, and (sometimes) research to think it through and figure out a solution.</p><p>Figuring out Hibernate was easy.  (Though, tapestry does all the work.)  Implementing LessCss wasn't really difficult either.  Getting tomcat running, and setting things up on a new host took some time, but I just needed to read through documentation, and chat with tech support for my host.  Figuring out how to get Japanese text working in the database took a little while, too.</p><p>Nothing was outside of my ability, and I was able to do everything I wanted.</p><div class='title'><b>Back Up</b></div><p>Theschlock.com is really just a mirror of what I have locally.  <b>I never have to worry about losing something online</b> because it's just a copy.  All the code is stored on <a href="http://github.com/dyreschlock" title="http://github.com/dyreschlock">Git Hub</a>, so I'll never lose it.</p><p>Every time I make a new post, I insert it into my local database directly with no interface.  To deploy those changes online, I make a backup, and then restore the online database with the backup.  This is AMAZING because it ensures that I will always have a backup of my data, and that the backup works!  I put every backup into my Google Drive, so I'll never lose that data either.</p><p>All my photos for theschlock.com are on both Google Drive, and my web server.  Even if all that data is lost on the server, I can just upload everything again from Google Drive.</p><p>Every time I make changes to my site, I'm redeploying it in a way that could be done any web host, not just the one I'm using now.  </p><p>This sense of security is something I NEVER had with Wordpress, or any blog software for that matter.  If any of those blogs died, everything I worked on would be gone forever.  I never have to worry about that with this approach.  Every aspect of this site is backed up, and will never be lost.  (Unless github and google are lost.)</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Writing code is pretty easy.  You just need to keep things organized, simple, and then make sure they work.  <b>Design</b> is much different beast, and a very easy road block to kill this whole project.  I haven't done much design work in the last 7 years.  And there were many times when I would design something on paper, and it would look terrible after its implementation.</p><p>The Wordpress design I had before wasn't too bad, but I didn't want the side bars.  I knew what I wanted, and those translated into User stories easily, and then to Tapestry Pages from there.</p><p>1.  The index page would be the most recent post on the site.<br/>2.  The post must be the most prominent thing on the page.<br/>3.  No side bars.  Only show the post.<br/>4.  The site must translate to mobile well.<br/>5.  Keep it simple stupid.</p><p>Like usual, my design from scratch looked like garbage.  As dumb as it sounds, searching for "good blog designs" on google gave me a lot of inspiration. :)  </p><p>I paged through a couple articles highlighting the best of the web and came across <b>Dan Cederholm's</b> website: <a href="http://simplebits.com/" title="http://simplebits.com/">Simple Bits</a>.  Holy shit, this guy's design was beautifully simple.  It hit all 5 points of my check list, and was very sharp.</p><p>I went to work using the top-down approach and the site pulled itself together pretty easily.  After my initial implementation, I had my friend <a href="http://www.mlatzke.com/" title="http://www.mlatzke.com/">Matt Latzke</a> take a look at it.  He suggested that I add a lot more spacing between components, and choose a second complimentary font for titles, and things.</p><div class='title'><b>Fonts</b></div><p>My favorite serif font is Garamond.  I've been using Garamond for my resume, term papers, and almost anything I've typed since my beginning days in college.  I wanted something better than Times New Roman, and Garamond just has a sleek simplicity to itself.  I don't know, I can't really describe it.</p><p>Matt suggested that using Garamond for absolutely every piece of text on the site was design overkill.  I didn't think it looked too bad, but having only one font did make the site feel a bit…  I dunno…  sheltered?</p><p>Anyway, I went to google again, and searched for good complimentary web fonts for Garamond.  Helvetica came up a bunch, but I didn't really like the way it looked with Garamond.  Eventually, I came across Gill Sans.  When bolded, it really stood out against Garamond.  It had very fat, but clean letters.  Very stylish, and different.</p><div class='title'><b>Archives</b></div><p>One other strong point I wanted for this site was the ease of getting to past posts, and finding everything on the site with only a few clicks.  I really hate Wordpress's pages for categories and archiving.  I want my users to be able to see everything, and find everything, and view it all in a small space.</p><p>My initial designs were terrible again, but thanks to Ray at Widen, he sent everyone a link to site with an amazing design: <a href="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html" title="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html">Rob Ashton's Blog</a>.  This site is so incredibly simple.  If I had seen this 2 months ago, theschlock.com would probably look different.</p><p>For the archives…  Shit, just dump out all the post titles on the page and line 'em up.  Nothing is more simpler than that!</p><p>I wanted to have some featured posts, too, and display an image to draw the user in.  I really like how <a href="http://www.theverge.com" title="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a> handles their recent posts on the category pages, highlights posts with images, and still keeps the design nice and clean.</p><p>I started doing something like that, but those highlighted posts naturally fell to the side of the categories and post titles.  Everything just fit together that way.</p><div class='title'><b>(Basically) Finished</b></div><p>Figuring out the design for the archive and category pages was really the last unfinished feature.  With that now complete, theschlock.com is (basically) finished!  Obviously, I'll probably change a few things here and there down the road, but this is it.</p><p>The site does pretty much everything I ever wanted, and I'm in complete control of all aspects.</p><p>"It's the [website] I've always wanted, and now I have it.  I rule!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Fresh Start" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start">A Fresh Start</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been over 10 years since I started writing about random things on the Internet.  It started with some emo poetry.  Soon after, I began posting more daily journal style entries, along with photos from club events.  2003 was when I broke away from geocities, and tripod, and registered the url: theschock.com.  I hosted drawings, and photos, and still typed away pretty regularly.  </p><p>In the beginning, I used MovableType.  Some of my friends were using that with their blogs, and swore by it.  It wasn't too bad.  In 2006, I was about to go to Japan for the first time as a study abroad student, and I wanted something new for my website before I left.  In that summer, I installed Wordpress, and have been using that since.  Wordpress was easy to install, and easy to add posts, and everything.  But I never really liked it.  Templates were difficult to design, and PHP is a terrible language.  But, whatever.  It was fine.</p><p>I vowed to completely redo this website at some point.  Especially after working as a Software Developer designing and developing web applications, you'd think I would actually come up with something amazing.  But no.  Wordpress stayed installed and collected all the posts I wrote.</p><p>All this time I was with the same host, Collosalhost.  From the very beginning in 2003, they've been hosting all my stupid crap.  2009 was the first time, I had some trouble with them.  They had some massive server loss, and lost almost 50% of their customers data to some failure.  They had backups for everyone, but that was the first time, after putting things on the Internet that I thought things might actually be over.  I wrote about it a little bit here: <a href="/old/v7/the-website-is-down" title="/the-website-is-down">May 29th, 2009</a>.  Wordpress stayed up, and I continued to be lazy.  2012 was finally when I started laying the groundwork, and created my own Tapestry 5 build free from my job.</p><p>Six months ago, Collosalhost shut down my Wordpress blog without telling me.  A week or two went by and I finally emailed them and asked them what was going on.  "blah blah you don't update the version, blah blah security risk."  Well, it would've been nice to be notified, rather than having to ask about it.  And the email continued on with its condescending patronizing attitude.  Christ.  This is how to treat your customers, huh?</p><p>Well today, all those dreams and ambitions have finally been realized, and I've finally redone my website completely from the ground-up!  A new design, a new host, and everything is completely written from scratch in Java using Tapestry 5, Hibernate, and Tomcat.</p><p>Some of the things aren't fully implemented yet, but you can view all my posts from the last 10 years.  All 612 of them from my MovableType and Wordpress blogs, plus a few more I hadn't posted yet. :)</p><p>All in all, this would be the 8th or 9th version of my website?  I think.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shipping Action Figures on eBay" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shipping-action-figures-on-ebay">Shipping Action Figures on eBay</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 2, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><a href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-2" title="/schlock-for-sale-2">A little over one year ago</a>, I took a long look at the excessive piles of stuff that plagued my apartment and my parent's house, and finally did something about it.  I bought an eBay store, and started listing VHS tapes, DVDs, Video Games, Music, Action Figures, and other things on Half.com and eBay.  Throughout the following months, it was incredibly successful.  There were weeks when I'd have as much as 5 packages to send out each day.  Things eventually died down, but there have been <a href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-restock" title="/schlock-for-sale-restock">restock days</a> every now and then.</p><p>Action figures have been the most annoying items to send because there really isn't a standard issue box to accomodate the variety of dimensions.  Some are taller, some are fatter, some are heavy, some are fragile.  Eventually, I came across a pretty effecient way to box them, and I'd like to share that with you.</p><div class='title'><b>How I box an action figure</b></div><p>For every action figure I sell, I create a completely custom box to ship it in.  In order to create a box from nothing, I needed some cardboard.  Cardboard is VERY easy to come by if you live in an apartment building that frequenty changes residents.  One day I found two HUGE U-haul boxes in the recycling bin, which have served me incredibly well.  I dragged those back to my apartment and stuffed them in our extra closet.  I've found some more boxes over the months, so they've begun to pile up...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Cutting</b></div><p>With the largest chunk of cardboard, I begin measuring the dimensions of the action figure on the box.  Though, usually, I just begin cutting with a box cutter.  The dimensions don't have to be exact because cardboard bends and shape very easily.
