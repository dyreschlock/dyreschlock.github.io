It was fought between the Western Army led by Ishida Mitsunari on behalf of the newly established somewhat traditional government of Japan, and Tokugawa Ieyasu who considered Japan weak to outsiders and wanted to establish a new government. Tokugawa won the battle, and after establishing a new government brought forth 250 years of peace and prosperity. This stability led to a sharp increase in population, education, and overall wellbeing.</p><p>The battle happened on October 21st, 1600.</p><div class='title'><b>Leading to the Battle</b></div><p>In the 1500s, Japan was in chaos. The time is referred to the Warring States period, or Sengoku-jidai <span class='ja'>戦国時代</span>. It's called this because Japan was in a constant state of civil war. In 1573, Oda Nobunaga led his army to the capital and overthrew reigning Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki. From there, his army spread out conquering the nearby kingdoms.</p><p>In the middle of his conquest, he was betrayed and committed seppuku rather than be captured. This was in 1582. He was succeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi who continued the conquest, and brought all of Japan together as a single kingdom by 1592. He restored power to the emperor, but he was really the one in charge. In 1593, his second son was born, and planned on succeded him as grand regeant to the emperor.</p><p>Toyotomi died in 1598 leaving behind his 5-year-old son, and a council of regeants to teach and advise him until he was old enough to assume his position. This is where the TV show and novel <b>Shogun</b> begins. Immediately after his death, the Council of Five Regeants begin scheming and allying to seize control of Japan for themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Shogun and The Council of Five</b></div><p>The Shogun TV show is slightly different than history, and of course all the names have been changed. The Council of Five had the following members: <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span>, <b>Ukita</b> Hideie <span class='ja'>宇喜多秀家</span>, <b>Maeda</b> Toshiie <span class='ja'>前田利家</span>, <b>Uesugi</b> Kagekatsu <span class='ja'>上杉景勝</span>, and <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>. Mori only became a member of the council because of his uncle's death a year prior. His uncle was <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage <span class='ja'>小早川隆景</span>, who is sometimes considered an honorary member of The Council.</p><p>Almost immediately after Toyotomi's death, Tokugawa began a series of marriage pacts and campaigns to secure his family, despite it being forbidden by the council laws. Maeda was said to have been part of this conspiracy. <b>Ishida</b> Mitsunari <span class='ja'>石田三成</span> was one of the highest level bureacrats in Toyotomi's government. He considered Tokugawa's action a complete insult to Toyotomi's legacy and quickly aligned himself with Ukita, Mori, and Uesugi. He also had powerful friendships with <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> and <b>Shima</b> Sakon <span class='ja'>島清興</span>. </p><p>While Ishida gained the support of many lords of western kingdoms, Tokugawa gained support from the east. One of his strongest allies was <b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span>, who was perhaps the best military strategist in Japan at that time. He was the chief strategist for Toyotomi. Ishida apparently loathed and often insulted the military commanders, so Kuroda and six other commanders planned to assassinate him. Tokugawa actually quelled their attempt, and later recruited all of them in his Eastern Army.</p><p>Several skermishes in the east and west pulled the armies together as they met in Sekigahara on October 21, 1600.</p><div class='title'><b>The Battle Stage</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the morning of the battle, a thick fog covered Sekigahara. No one could see more than a few meters in front of them. But with the sunrise, the fog had disspated by around 8am and all the armies could see their opponents.</p><p>The Eastern Army led by <b>Tokugawa</b> is red. They created a "fish scale" battle pattern with the main forces creating a line directly opposing the Western Army. <b>Kuroda</b> <span class='ja'>黒田</span> and <b>Takenaka</b> <span class='ja'>竹中</span> positioned themselves on Okayama hill <span class='ja'>岡山</span> in the north overlooking the battlefield. <b>Fukushima</b> <span class='ja'>福島</span> led the main force on the frontline poised to strike first.</p><p>The Western Army is mainly blue, but also consists of the yellow and green armies at the start of the battle. They are multi-colored because of some key moments in the battle which led to their defeat. The main force was led by <b>Ukita</b> <span class='ja'>宇喜多</span>, one of the Five Regeants. <b>Ishida</b> <span class='ja'>石田</span> positioned himself with <b>Shima</b> <span class='ja'>島</span> at the most northern on the army line on Sasaoyama <span class='ja'>笹尾山</span>. Colored in blue, the furthest south is <b>Otani</b> <span class='ja'>大谷</span>, Ishida's other close friend. But, the largest army on the southern end of the west army was <b>Kobayakawa</b> <span class='ja'>小早川</span>, colored in yellow.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, the Western Army had around 82,000 soldiers compared to the Eastern Army's 88,888. Fearing Ishida's defeat, several lords who pledged support for Ishida did not attend the battle.</p><div class='title'><b>The Battle Begins</b></div><p>As the fog cleared, it is said that <b>Ii</b> Naomasa <span class='ja'>井伊直政</span> and <b>Matsudaira</b> Tadayoshi <span class='ja'>松平忠吉</span> of the Eastern Army ordered their gunmen to take aim and fire on <b>Ukita's</b> army. <b>Fukushima</b> <span class='ja'>福島</span>, frontline battle commander of the Eastern Army and who was promised first-attack by Tokugawa, became enraged and ordered his whole army to quickly join the fight against <b>Ukita</b>. From Okayama Hill, <b>Kuroda</b> <span class='ja'>黒田</span> noticed that the battle had begun, and fired his flare to signal all frontline Eastern armies to attack the West. The full engagement of the battle began sometime between 8am and 10am.</p><p>The Eastern Army moved in to engage the Western Army, and with the frontlines of both armies holding off each other, Tokugawa began advancing his groups from the far east of the battlefield to encourage his troops and also scare his opponents.</p><p>All the while, <b>Kobayakawa</b> <span class='ja'>小早川</span> stood on the top of Mt. Matsuo <span class='ja'>松尾山</span>, his forces never joining the battle. Prior to the battle, he had made an agreement with Tokugawa through Kuroda. He would betray Ishida and join the fight as a member of the Eastern Army. But, he had yet to make any move. Ishida fired a flare signalling him to attack, but still he stood there with indecision. </p><p>Apparently, it wasn't until Tokugawa's troops fired some warning shots at him that <b>Kobayakawa</b> ordered his troops down the hill and attack <b>Otani</b> <span class='ja'>大谷</span>, the nearest of the Western Army. Otani was prepared for Kobayakawa's betrayal, but didn't expect several others to join him. His forces could not withstand their rush attack. Otani committed seppuku in the woods and ordered his retainer to hide his head to prevent it from getting into enemy hands. </p><p>All of the yellow armies were now members of the Eastern Army. Behind the Eastern Army, in the back, marked in green, were forces led by the <b>Mori</b> <span class='ja'>毛利</span> clan. They pledged to fight for the Western Army, but were prevented from joining when one of their armies refused to fight. And after seeing Kobayakawa turn, they knew that winning was hopeless.</p><p>With <b>Otani's</b> forces eradicted, <b>Kobayakawa's</b> betrayal, and <b>Mori's</b> neutrality, the Western Army had collapsed. The was no way for <b>Ishida</b> to win. His friend Otani was dead. His other friend, Shima, was missing and presumed killed in battle. Four other battle commanders were also killed. He ordered a retreat. He, Ukita, and a few others escaped from the battle.</p><p><b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span> and nephew <b>Shimadzu</b> Toyohisa <span class='ja'>島津豊久</span>, leaders of their forces in the Western Army refused to turn their backs to the enemy to retreat. While the battle had mostly concluded by 2pm, they launched a surprise offensive to the middle of the frontline, piercing through the Eastern Army. And making their retreat to the south. The nephew was killed in this surprise attack/retreat, but Yoshihiro could escape.</p><p>The Battle was over. The full length of the battle only took around 6 hours, although the main clash of armies only took place from Kuroda's signal flare to not long after Otani committed seppuku. Of the Western Army's 82,000 soldiers, 23,000 had defected and 35,270 were killed. The Eastern Army only lost 8,000 soldiers.</p><div class='title'><b>After the Battle</b></div><p>As the fighting ceased, the remaining Western soldiers were either captured or executed. Tokugawa put down a folding stool in the field near his final encampment and performed the post-battle ritual called the Head Viewing Ceremony, or kubi-jikken <span class='ja'>首実検</span>.</p><p>This spot and so many other key locations of the battle have been preserved in modern day Sekigahara.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here is the location where Tokugawa sat as he inspected the heads. Next to this is a plaque which describes the scene:</p><p><i>Tokugawa Ieyasu, fresh from his decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, sat here on a folding stool called a shogi to inspect the heads of the enemy commanders his allies presented. The heads, once inspected, were buried in two great mounds along with the corpses from the battlefield. During the Warring States Period, it was customary to mourn the dead of both sides, enemy and ally alike, so this inspection was also a gesture of respect for the dead.</i></p><p>Wikipedia continues by explaining that the Head Viewing Ceremony was a way of mourning and respecting the dead of both sides, but it was also a way for victorious commanders and soldiers to get recognized for their valor in the battle, and get properly rewarded for it. This scene is illustrated at <a href="/old/v7/sekigahara-warland$0023head-viewing" title="/sekigahara-warland#head-viewing">Sekigahara Warland.</a></p><p>After the heads were inspected, they were wrapped in cloth and placed in one of two massive burial mounds along with the corpses of the dead.</p><p>Today, the site of the Head Viewing Ceremony and Tokugawa's final encampment is the location of the new Battle of Sekigahara museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Battle of Sekigahara Museum</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Battle of Sekigahara Museum opened recently in 2020, and while I consider the museum a must visit if you're going to Sekigahara, it is a very uneven experience. I arrived just as the museum opened at 9:30am. Tickets are only 500<span class='ja'>円</span> which includes a theater experience, if reservations are not full. I was first on the standby list for the film starting at 9:45am. There were only a few reservations ahead of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Theater</b></div><p>Entering the theater, you walk down a hallway with projected names of the wall of all those involved in the battle. The first theater is a trapezoidal room with a projected map on the floor. The map begins showing dates and events leading up to the battle. It shows a full map of Japan where Ishida and Tokugawa allies were located, and zooms in on the center of Japan as their forces begin to converge in Sekigahara.</p><p>As everyone entered the room and surrounded the map, the film was introduced by the guide and then it began. It quickly went through the leading dates and events again, and then showed Sekigahara. Each army, their commander, and their position on the map was introduced, and then the battle began as I had described it above. </p><p>As each key moments of the battle played out, the armies moved on the map and clashed with their opponents. It was kind of like a strategy game, which became an incredibly effective way of showing how the battle progressed. The soldiers themselves were tiny little colored men, but the commanders of those armies were blown up giants when their key moments took place. They spoke their intentions with emotion and feeling which illustrated some intensity of the battle.</p><p>As the battle concluded, everyone moved into the next, octogonal theater. This one had theater seating. I sat in the back and the film began showing the same battle, but this time, from the point of view of the ground rather than a birdseye view. The film was projected onto half of the room, giving us a 180 view of the battle. Fans mounted on the ceiling blew air at us and we sweeped around the battle. Lights flashed as gun fire erupted. And the ground shook and rumbled our seats as horses ran past. Once again, each of the key moments of battle were highlighted showing us the emotion of the commanders and their decisions which led to either victory or defeat.</p><p>It was a pretty hyped experience and incredibly effective at teaching us about the battle and those involved. Prior to the museum, I really only knew about Ishida and Tokugawa, and also knew about Otani committing seppuku. Now I knew about the majority of key commanders in the battle and what they did. I don't think I have ever visited a museum and came out learning as much as I had from this.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Exhibit</b></div><p>The theater experience is in STARK contrast to the rest of the museum. After exiting the theater, we rode the escalator to the second floor. The second floor exhibit shows the number of soldiers in each of the army, and then displays replica armor of each of the commanders. Shiny new looking armor, obviously not realistic to what they actually wore at the time.</p><p>From there, several letters were displayed of correspondence between commanders leading up to the battle. I had no idea what any of these were at the time. They might be more interesting now that I've researched the battle in more detail for these blog posts.</p><p>Overall, the main exhibit of the museum was just a bunch of stuff that wasn't presented with a strong connection to the subject. It was completely different compared with the film on the first floor. At the end of the exhibit, there were some swords and guns that you could pick up to feel their weight, but it felt kinda tacked on.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Observatory</b></div><p>The fifth floor gave a 360-degree view of Sekigahara. The museum was in the very center of town and the center of the battle, so you could see everything from this point.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>Looking east is Mt. Nangu <span class='ja'>南宮山</span>, the tallest mountain on the right, and in front of that is Mt. Momobukari <span class='ja'>桃配山</span>. Mt. Nangu was where <b>Mori</b> Hidemoto <span class='ja'>毛利秀元</span> stationed his encampment and Mt. Momobukari was where <b>Kikkawa</b> Hiroie <span class='ja'>吉川広家</span> stationed his. </p><p>Not fully detailed above, but Kikkawa fought for the Western Army and was a member of the Mori clan. He secretly made a deal with Kuroda and Tokugawa that if he prevented the Mori clan from attacking, the Mori clan would retain all their lands after battle. Kikkawa kept his word and prevented the Mori clan from attacking, but the Mori had no knowledge of this neutrality. After the battle, Kikkawa was labeled a traitor to the clan, and the Mori was still punished for supporting Ishida.</p><p>At the base of Mt.

At this time, Kazumasa hung the statue of the Omononushi <span class='ja'>大物主神</span>, the diety of Kotohira Shrine (from his hometown of Kotohira Town in Kagawa Prefecture, called Sanuki province at the time), which he had been carrying on a pine branch and prayed for victory in the battle.</i></p><p><i>After the Battle, the villages are said to have received this statue and worshipped it. It is also said that during the Keio period, the village headman of Sekigahara, Furuyama Ichiya <span class='ja'>古山一八</span>, renovated the shrine's buldings. After that, the entire village of Sekigahara revered the god of business and the Kotohira-Ko <span class='ja'>金刀比羅講</span> was organized. Every year on October 10th, a representative was sent to the main shrine in Sanuki (Kagawa pref.) to present a sacred talisman. (This is no longer done.)

Sasao gave Ishida a full view of Sekigahara. Ishida could see all of his armies on the west and also see all the armies of the east coming at him. Okayama's plateau was probably visible at the time, but if not, you could still clearly see any army coming from that location, with the exception of Kuroda's flank attack which went further north, using the forest as cover.</p><p>The nearby plaque had the following to say:</p><p><i>Mt. Sasao was the perfect defensive position, providing high ground and a panoramic view. Ishida Mitsunari's approximately 6,000 troops departed Ogaki Castle in the dead of the night on October 20th and set up camp here, around 1am on October 21, the day of the battle.</i></p><p><i>The battle commenced around 8am. Mitsunari's troops, fronted by Shima Sakon, repeated repulsed attacks from the powerful Eastern armies, but were gradually forced to retreat.</i></p><p><i>The Western Army fought bravely, despite Shimadzu Yoshihiro, Kobayakawa Hideaki, and Mori Hidemoto failing to enter the battle, greatly reducing the Western Army's total fighting force.</i></p><p><i>Hideaki finally switched allegiances joining the Eastern cause around noon, attacking and annihilating Otani Yoshitsugu's troops, starting a chain reaction that brought the Western Army down. Mitsunari's troops persevered against the advancing Eastern forces, but were finally defeated around 2pm. In the hopes of raising another army, Mitsunari fled west towards Mt. Ibuki.</i></p><p>It says the Shimadzu was unable to join the battle? I don't know what that means, as everything I had seen so far has him in the battle.</p><p>Mt.

Sasao.</p><p>The Battlefield Monument plaque had the following to say:</p><p><i>Although the Western Army was initially numerically superior to the Eastern forces, Kobayakawa Hideaki, who had previously pledged to betray his Western allies, remained a spectator to the battle, leaving Ishida Mitsunari to fight valiantly with less troops.</i></p><p><i>Despite this, the Western Army fought intently with repeated advances and retreats until around noon, when Hideaki finally turned his allegiances to the East and intentionally attacked the Western Army, resulting in its total defeat. It is thought that Mitsunari and Shimadzu Yoshihiro's troops were then overwhelmed by the advancing Eastern Army. With Mitsunari's units soon overrun, the Shimadzu clan retreated from the front lines. Japan's largest ever and most decisive battle was over in a mere half-a-day.</i></p><p>This field is where some of the battle reenactments take place.</p><div class='title'><b>Mt.

The other locations were as simple as parking the car and walking up the stairs. This one actually took time in additional to the time stopped to take photos.

Matsuo provided a panoramic view of Sekigahara and was therefore a strategically important position. Kobayakawa Hideaki stationed his troops here the day before the battle on October 20th.</i></p><p><i>Hideaki had formed a pact with Eastern leader Tokugawa Ieyasu prior to this, but failed to take action once the battle commenced.

Hideaki played a major role in the Eastern Army's victory. He was awarded vast territories in Bizen, Okayama after the battle, but died two years later aged just 21.</i></p><p>The hike up the mountain wasn't difficult at all compared to other mountains I have hiked before. This particular path probably didn't exist at the time, and the overall mountain may have had several paths more suited for horses and infantry movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The summit did give a great view of the totality of Sekigahara, so Kobayakawa was able to see all the armies engage each other in the middle and see all their movements. You can clearly see Ishida and Kuroda's positions at Mt. Sasao and Okayama.</p><p>The above plaque and other research says that Kobayakawa finally made his decision to betray Ishida when Tokugawa fired shots at Mt. Matsuo to force him into a decision. But, other scholars have pointed out that with the chaos of battle and general distance, there would really be no way for him to tell the difference between shots fired at him or anyone else in battle.</p><p>The plaque at the top of the mountain had some other insights:</p><p><i>Mt. Matsuo, located here on the border between Mino (Gifu prefecture) and Omi (Shiga prefecture) overlooking vital roadways from its 293m summit, has long been recognized as a strategic viewpoint. Prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, Western commander Ishida Mitsunari ordered maintenance work be done to the mountaintop castle as part of the preparations against the Eastern forces. The existing remains of the castle are from the time of these repairs. One day before the battle, Kobayakawa Hideaki led his 15,000 troops here to Mt. Matsuo and entered the castle.</i></p><p><i>For much of the battle, Kobayakawa remained a spectator to the action taking place below, failing to fight for one side or the other until around midday, when he betrayed the Western side. Attacking Otani Yoshitsugu's forces, Kobayakawa brought about the downfall of the Western ranks, and provided victory to the Eastern Army.</i></p><p><i>A large area near the top of the mountain has been flattened, and is surrounded by a low earthen wall. The remains of a masugata gate system to prevent enemy intrusion can also be found. The ruins cover an area of around 400m east to west and 250m north to south, indicating that Matsuo Castle was one of the largest mountain castles in the Mino (Gifu) area.</i></p><p>There used to be so many smaller castles in Japan, especially battle castles perched on mountains at strategic points. Nearly all of those castles are gone now, having been destroyed by whomever took them over.</p><p>Also at the summit were 6 frogs hanging out in a muddy bit of water makin' babies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, no matter whether Kobayakawa saw the warning shots or ultimately made the decision on his own after viewing the battle, his troops rode straight down the mountain and into the forest directly north to face the troops of <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span>.</p><div class='title'><b>Otani's Gravesite and Encampment</b></div><p>While Kobayakawa's encampment was the final place I visited in Sekigahara on that day, I went to Otani's encampment in the morning before going to the museum.

From here, it was possible to see Mt. Matsuo, where Kobayakawa Hideaki had stationed his army. Yoshitsugu remained suspicious of Hideaki's intentions and prepared himself accordingly.</i></p><p><i>Too sick to ride a horse, he is said to have led his men into battle from a palanquin. Yoshitsugu's troops were prepared for Hideaki's attack when he defected around noon. Initially the Otani repelled the powerful turncoat forces, but were overcome owing to Wakisaka Yasuharu and others also turning sides.</i></p><p>It must've been around here or slightly further into the forest where after being told that the battle was hopeless, Otani admitted defeat and committed seppuku.</p><p>Further into the forest was Otani's grave.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The nearby plaque tells the story of his demise:</p><p><i>Otani Yoshitsugu was overrun following the betrayal of Kobayakawa Hideaki and his followers. Demanding that his head never fall into the hands of the enemy, Yoshitsugu commited ritual suicide and his retainer, Yuasa Gosuke, hid Yoshitsugu's severed head, before encountering Todo Takanori of the Eastern Army. Gosuke offered his own head in return for the location of his master's head never being revealed. Takanori kept this promise and never told Tokugawa Ieyasu the whereabouts of the head.</i></p><p><i>Yoshitsugu's gravestone was erected by the Todo clan. The Yuasa family erected a gravestone to Gosuke besides Yoshitsugu's in 1916.</i></p><p>Obviously, the gravesite is still regularly attended today. The graves had fresh flowers and were clear of leaves and any other debris.</p><p>Otani's loyalty and death at the cost of his loyalty is ultimately revered. He went into battle probably knowing that it would not turn out well for him, but he still stood by his beliefs in Ishida and his ideals of the Toyotomi government.</p><p>Near his grave, a monument was built to remind everyone of his sacrafice.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plaque reads:</p><p><i>The tactics and strategies of the Battle of Sekigahara were studied by Japan's armed forces during the late 1800's Meiji period, the early 1900's Showa militarization period, and military exercises were conducted on the actual battlefield.</i></p><p><i>This monument was erected in 1940 by the Fuwa Historical Preservation Society in memory of Otani Yoshitsugu, who's end was seen as the epitome of Bushido.</i></p><p><i>The summary is as follows: Despite his ignored advice warning Ishida Mitsunari against raising arms, Otani Yoshitsugu allied himself with, and fought hard for the Western forces out of loyalty to his former master, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whom he served alongside Mitsunari. Being outnumbered and having lost his battle, he sacrificed himself by his own hand in the true Bushido spirit.</i></p><p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, people ultimately respect Otani and his sacrafice the most.</p><p>On the other hand, people seem to hate Kobayakawa, despite his actions causing Tokugawa to win and create peace and prosperity for 250 years. At the museum, each ticket is printed with a warlord. The person behind me in line got Kobayakawa on her ticket, and her date was teasing her the whole time. <span class='ja'>いやだ〜</span>, she kept saying.</p><div class='title'><b>Remembrance</b></div><p>The biggest reason people love this battle and its legacy continues to this day with TV shows, movies, manga, and other media is that the decisive victory completely changing the history of Japan. After the battle and after Tokugawa successfully rooted out the rest of the Toyotomi loyalists, he had complete control over the country, and his dictatorship led to great prosperity.</p><p>But, the other big reason for everyone's interest in the battle is also its divisiveness. Tokugawa was an asshole who completely undermined Toyotomi's rule immediately after his death. It was an insult to Toyotomi and Ishida was very outspoken about this. Others who also hated Tokugawa's attitude continued to stoke Ishida into action, and the schemes and political bullshit continued from there. While Ishida was also a bit of an asshole, he represented loyalty and honor. Many of his friends and commanders in the Western Army were the same.</p><p>The battle was ultimately a fight between those loyal to the current ideals of Japan and the strength of someone wanting all the power for himself. It's far different than people remembering something like the American Civil War, which was fought over slavery, something clearly right or wrong.</p><p>The TV show, Shogun, portrays Tokugawa as an underdog with Ishida trying to keep all the power for himself, but in reality it seems completely different. Of course, Shogun isn't trying to be completely historically accurate, but it still becomes pro-Tokugawa propaganda. The show really contextualized Japan's xenophobia at the time as the Europeans seemed intent on conquering Japan for themselves.</p><p>There is also a 2017 Japanese film based on a 1966 Japanese novel about the Battle of Sekigahara. It won a couple of awards, too, so I would like to see how they portray all the characters. Will they portray them in a neutral manor so the audience must decide which side was right? Or will they portray Tokugawa as a traitor to the current ideals of Japan or Ishida as a foolish conservative?</p><p>After visiting the sites and museums, I am more on the side of Ishida in this fight, even though it is clear that his loss was a necessity for Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Revisit</b></div><p>I am way more informed about the Battle than I was before having visited these locations, gone through all the photos, and looked up all the information online.</p><p>Now, there are several more locations I want to visit, like Mori's encampment on Mt. Nangu, Shimadzu's and Ukita's encampment in the middle of the Western Army, Fukushima's encampment at the head of the Eastern army, some of the other local folklore museums in Sekigahara, and the Sekigahara visitor center at the station. I would also like to visit the Battle museum and Samurai Armor museum again with my now better base of knowledge.</p><p>There are so many minor lords who participated in the battle, too, who each have their story. Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, founder of modern day Takayama, also participated in the battle with around 1,000 troops. I wonder if they placed a marker at his position.</p><p>I definitely want to check out the Battle Reenactment festival, too, so maybe I'll visit all these locations in October, if there's time. We'll see.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
