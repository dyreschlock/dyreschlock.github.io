| April 26, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the northern area of Miyagawa village, there's an impressive museum called the Miyagawa Archaelogical Museum. It is a collection of artifacts from the history of the village, including pottery and tools from ancient times, clothes and farm equipment from the Edo period, and items from the Meiji and Showa periods.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, less than 1000 people live in the village. Although, that number is difficult to determine because the village is just one part of Hida City. The totality of Hida City has a population of around 26,000, but the majority of its residents live in Furukawa and Kamioka.</p><p>Hida City was officially incorporated in 2004 as a merger of Furukawa, Kamioka, Kawai Village, and Miyagawa Village. Prior to the merger, the population of Miyagawa Village was 1140. Being a single municipality, the junior high and elementary schools were able to consolidate and merge as well.</p><p>I call the museum impressive because Miyagawa is not very big, yet this museum has thousands of artifacts collected throughout the history of the village. In the main hall, over 16,000 materials are on display from the Edo, Meiji, and Showa periods.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first floor of the main hall is dedicated to items of the <b>Edo period</b>. The bulk of the collection is farming and carpentry equipment, but there is also a huge assortment of items used for surviving the harsh mountain winters. Snow removal and travel is of the most importance in the winter, as is winter clothing for inside and outside of the house.</p><p>You can see the daily clothing of the people in warmer weather, too. They also had a few horse saddles, which did not look comfortable for either the horse nor the rider.</p><p>All these items had been tagged with the general year they were used and the location and family they were from, if that information was available.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the back, a hallway led to an annexing building that focused on archaelogical digs of the Miyagawa region. Many decorative pots had been reconstructed from their excavations, and believed to be from some time between the Paleolithic and Jomon periods of Japanese history. (14,000 years ago to 2500).</p><p>In total, there are 1842 items on display, and perhaps more in the research rooms that are closed to the public.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The most interesting part of the museum to me was the second floor collection of items in the main hall from the <b>Showa and Meiji Periods</b>. The Edo Period is obviously interesting, but I really like the Showa period as it bridges the gap between those old times and today. It's the building blocks of today's society.</p><p>There were some items from war, but the most interesting stuff was their massive collection of school items, especially their collection of elementary school diplomas from the last 150 years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As mentioned above, Miyagawa Village <span class='ja'>宮川村</span> is now just a neighborhood of Hida City having merged together in 2004. But, Miyagawa Village itself was a merger of two other smaller villages, established in 1956. It was the merger of Sakagami <span class='ja'>坂上</span> and Sakashita <span class='ja'>坂下</span> Villages. At the time, Sakagami Village had a population of 2400, and Sakashita had a population of about 1400. Again, today, Miyagawa has less than 1000 people, so they've lost 75% of their population over 75 years.</p><p>Going back even further in history, both Sakagami and Sakashita villages were also mergers in 1875, which was Meiji <span class='ja'>明治</span>8<span class='ja'>年</span>, in Japanese years. The merger was part of the overall Meiji restoration of Japan.</p><p>From this merger, 4 elementary schools and 4 junior high schools were established for Sakagami <span class='ja'>坂上</span>, Sakashita <span class='ja'>坂下</span>, Omukari <span class='ja'>大無雁</span>, and Tanekura <span class='ja'>種蔵</span>. Later, the Omukari and Tanekura junior high schools were merged into Sakagami Junior High.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, the oldest diploma (that I was able to read) in the case was from Meiji <span class='ja'>明治</span>12<span class='ja'>年</span>, which was 1879. The diploma was presented to Matsunosuke Maruyama <span class='ja'>丸山松之助</span> for completing 10 years and 1 month of school. (There was another diploma next to it for 10 yeras 7 months for the same person.)</p><p>The diploma was issued by Sakagami Elementary School, but, again, being so early in the Meiji restoration, the location had a different name and even the kanji are now outdated by today's standards. It reads <span class='ja'>岐阜縣管下吉城郡坂上村坂上小學校</span>, or Gifu Prefecture Jurisdiction Yoshiki Distirct Sakagami Village Sakagami Elementary School. It wouldn't be until the incorporation of Hida City that Yoshiki District would be abolished.</p><p>I find the kanji really interesting. Gifu Prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜縣</span> is now written as <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span> these days. And school <span class='ja'>學校</span> is now written as <span class='ja'>学校</span>. As part of the Post World War II government, many kanji were simplified.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's a diploma from Sakagami Elementary again from <span class='ja'>明治</span>16<span class='ja'>年</span> or 1883. This is to another student of the Maruyama family, probably Matsunosuke's younger brother or sister. The official title of the school changed to <span class='ja'>岐阜縣飛騨國吉城郡坂上村公立坂上小學校</span> or Gifu Precture Hida Province Yoshiki Distinct Sakagami Village Public Sakagami Elementary School. Hida Province and Public were added to the title. This person completed 9 years 6 months of elementary school.</p><p>9 or 10 years of elementary school certainly seems like a long time. It wasn't until 1886 that Junior High schools existed in Japan, so prior to that time, the term "elementary" school was generally used to describe all public primary schooling. Anyone who wanted to be a teacher or some kind of scholar would move away and attend a high school. Also in 1886, "normal" schools were established, which focused education on a specific field of study.</p><p>Anyways, I stared at the diplomas for a while looking at the dates and marveling at how documents from over 100 years ago were still preserved so well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Opposite of the diploma display case were items used for these schools. One of the catalogued items on display was the sign board for Sakashita Junior High School. Several photos of classes were pinned to the wall besides it. One photo was of their school trip to Kyoto in 1952. Below was their school manual, and a few textbooks.</p><p>The case next to the diplomas was filled was textbooks of the same time period.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, this museum was pretty incredible. I didn't know this at the time, but because the museum is so big and Miyagawa village is so small, they can't staff the museum all year round. The museum is only open 30 days a year because of that. It's open 3 weeks around Golden Week, during Obon, and a few more weekends in September, October, and November. So, I was pretty lucky to stumble into the museum on a day it was fully open.</p><p>I talked with the old man staffing the museum about some of the items and where the old schools were located.</p><p>The main area of Sakagami Village is now the downtown area of Miyagawa Village, which is where Miyagawa Elementary school is today. Miyagawa Elementary School was established in 2000, and these days only has 7 students.</p><p>But, this is not the same location of Sakagami Elementary School. The old man mentioned that even though that old school had been torn down, the gym of Sakagami Elementary was still in town and in use today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty easy to find. It's just down the street from Sakagami Station in the heart of Miyagawa. The building still looks really nice considering it was built 150 years ago. In place of the old elementary school, was some kind of temple. It's called the <span class='ja'>世界聖誠会</span>, which Google translates as the World Society of the Holy Spirit. The temple is connected to the gym now, so they use it for something.</p><p>I wanted to take a look inside, but everything was closed and all the shades were drawn. And going around knocking on doors didn't seem like a good idea.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Downtown Miyagawa had another relic, the Sakagami Village Post Office. Even the title <span class='ja'>坂上郵便局</span> has its shadow still left on the side of the building. The doors were locked, but I could see inside through the windows. It seemed full of garbage, like old bicycles, wood panels, and other things. Maybe it was once used as storage for festival equipment, but nothing inside seemed useful.</p><p>The Sakagami Train Station looked pretty nice and modern. Maybe this was an effort of Hida City to try and get people to visit, but the whole place was deserted. Eventually an old man, possibly drunk, stumbled out of a nearby home to stare at me and figure out why I was snooping around. Eh, I was done here anyway.</p><p>The Miyagawa Archaelogical Museum is pretty special. And it's interesting how the museum itself seems to be a relic of the past when Japan had more time, money, and people to put it together. I wonder what other unique museums can be found up here in the mountains.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japan Travel Map Page" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japan-travel-map-page">Japan Travel Map Page</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I love discovering and learning about new and interesting places and their history. I have lived here for over 12 years now, but it's been almost 19 years since I first came here and became inspired to explore, take photos, and research.</p><p>Recently, I have been going through a lot of old unsorted, unprocessed photos and unfinished posts of travels. With nearly 200 posts talking about Japanese travel and locations, I wanted to see all these locations on a map. Through doing research about some locations, I found an open source JavaScript mapping library called <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and I've added a page with all these links pinned on a map.</p><p>Use the following link to view the <a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map">Japan Travel Map</a> page.</p><p class='img'><a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Travel Page is a little bit of a work-in-progress at the moment, so the styles and features may be updated or changed in the future.</p><p>I learned about Leaflet from visiting <a href="https://haikyo.info/" title="https://haikyo.info/">Haikyo.info</a>. This site is a collection of abandoned places around Japan and whether or not its possible to trespass and explore. I came across the site when trying to find information about the <a href="/old/v7/red-factory" title="/red-factory">Red Factory</a>, an old abandoned factory which was highly rated among ruins explorers. </p><p>Leaflet has been super easy to use. Going through their <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html" title="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html">Tutorials</a>, their quick start guide puts a map on a webpage almost immediately. Plotting points is incredibly simple, too, once you get the geo coordinates. It gets a little more complicated when you want to use layers to filter certain points on the map, but it was really just an extra step. You can take a look at the code, but there's not a whole lot of special things going on underneath.</p><p>By the way, the Red Factory is one post in a series of posts from 2016 when my friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit. These posts have their own <a href="/keyword/fishy-chaos" title="/keyword/fishy-chaos">keyword</a>, so you can view all 8 of the posts from there.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freeways" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freeways">Freeways</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's a pretty simple PC puzzle game where you draw freeways! As you click into a single map, the sides of the screen haves roads either entering or exiting the screen. Each road wants to connect to another road on the side of the screen, or to a building in the middle of the screen. To create the road, you draw it with the mouse. Right click for bridges!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" /></a></p><p>When you complete the roadways on the map, you click simulate and traffic pours into your roads. You are graded based on the complexity (difficulty) of the map, the amount of concrete you used, and the efficiency of the traffic, which is measured in its average speed through your roads. Occassionally, a map will have a score goal you should try to achieve. Getting the goal will unlock a photo of a real highway interchange to inspire more road building.</p><p>The YouTube channel I was following is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RealCivilEngineerGaming" title="https://www.youtube.com/@RealCivilEngineerGaming">Real Civil Engineering</a>. Apparently the guy worked in civil engineering for a while, and then quit to do YouTube stuff. His Freeways videos were fun because he often talked about the most efficient ways of building highway interchanges using the least amount of concrete and other strategies. After hearing about it enough, I wanted to try it, too.</p><p>Freeways was released in 2017 for iOS, PC, and Mac. I started playing it in January. There was a sale so it was only $5. BUT! It just so happened that after 8 years of no updates, Freeways got a full new expansion on Jan 28th for free!</p><p>The original game had 80 maps, and the new expansion gave us 81 new maps! So many maps! Many of these new maps were much harder than the original. Also, every map now had a target score to try and surpass. </p><p>And as another new feature, the game now had achievements! Only 4 achievements, though. Two of the achievemements were achieving all the goals on individual maps. The other two achievements were about surpassing a specific World Efficiency. World Efficiency is your grand total score of all your map scores on original and expansion maps. The original map efficiency score was 25000. The expansion map efficiency score was 40000.</p><p>After 3 months, I finally finished all of the new maps, and got all the achievements. Here are the maps of my roads.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" /></a></p><p>Freeways is a fun game. The original maps are pretty easy and fun to run through. The expansion maps get pretty challenging and sometimes very hard and frustrating. You can buy it on Steam, or directly from the <a href="https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways" title="https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways">developer on itch.io</a>.</p><p>I wonder if we'll get another 80 maps in 8 years again.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
