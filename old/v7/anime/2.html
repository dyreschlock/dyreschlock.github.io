| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A week and a half ago, Evangelion 1.0 was finally released on Bluray entitled Evangelion 1.11.  Not only was this the initial Bluray release for the new movie, but it also adds another 10 or 15 minutes of additional footage into the mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp"  /></p><p>Today, I got it in the mail!  I tore upon the Play-Asia envelope, quickly unwrapped the cellophane and put it into my Playstation 3.  Thanks to the advent of Bluray technology, "they" decided to redistribute which territories fit into which Regions.</p><div class='title'><b>Regions</b></div><p>For DVD Regions, the world was split into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg">6 regions</a>.  Unfortunately, the US and Japan were split.  Japan and Europe were snug into Region 2, but the US and Canada were in Region 1, all alone.</p><p>Bluray is different.  The world is now split into only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg">3 regions</a>.  All of the Americas, Japan and the Philippines occupy the same territory.  And Europe is on the outside with almost everyone else.  That's good!  Now the US has the ability to play Japanese Blurays at our convenience.</p><p>This only gives the ability to play the Bluray, of course.  There is no Bluray magic that transforms the speech into English or anything.  It is what it is.  And this particular Bluray <b>only offers Japanese Audio with no Subtitles</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Why then?</b></div><p>3 months ago, I finally downloaded Eva 1.0 and watched it, though I had a <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">little trouble</a>.  It's kinda weird that I waited so long to finally watch it considering how much I love the Anime.  I watched it and absolutely loved it.  But the quality was pretty bad.  It was good for Internet standards, but there were some scenes that were rough.</p><p>That's the main reason I bought the Bluray.  I wanted to see this film with absolute clarity.  And Evangelion 1.11 does not disappoint.  It is crystal clear and absolutely beautiful.  The sound is amazing too!</p><p>Also, It's not like I need the subtitles, anyways.  After spending so much time getting the subtitles to work on the copy I download back in <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">March</a>, I wondered why I wasted so much time.  I've seen the Anime almost 100 times now and basically have the whole thing memorized.</p><div class='title'><b>Great Bluray, but one problem...</b></div><p>It's annoying that there are no English subtitles.  Half of the reason I buy any movies these days is to share it with people.  And I can't really share this with my friends because they don't know Japanese.  We could attempt to watch it, and I could probably "translate".  But that would really be confusing.  Especially for my friends who've never seen Evangelion before.</p><p>Oh well.  The American release is in November.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-museum">Ghibli Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>This story begins on eBay.</b></div><p>Since October last year, I've begun selling a lot of my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" /></p><p>There was a store for costumes, one for retro games, one for newer game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp">copies</a> of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3305.webp">Metal Wolf Chaos</a> on Xbox, but they were more than $70 each.</p><p>Nakano Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" /></p><p>The Ghibli Museum was very rustic and homely. ^_^  Nested snug in a heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, taking pictures inside the Museum was not allowed.  But, the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" /></p><p>The path continued along the back to reveal a Laputa stone.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" /></p><p>There were other spiffy areas in the museum, too.  Like a life-sized Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" /></p><p>This was one of those Sushi restaurant that had a conveyer belt running through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" /></p><p>They had the best California Rolls I've ever eaten.  The avacado was crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion Dammit" rel="bookmark"

| March 15, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>How long ago was Evangelion 1.0 released in theaters?  I think it was around July 2007, wasn't it?  Even so, it's been out for a while.  And you'd think a die hard, unapologetic Evangelion fan such as myself would have seen it by now.  But I have not.  I guess I thought I was going to have or attend some big group watching Party with friends to see the rebirth, but that never happened.  At this point, I figured that the North American Bluray release would finally be the time I'd see it.  Funimation is releasing it in November 2009.</p><p>Anyways, this weekend was the first free weekend I've had for a while now.  So far on this lazy Saturday my accomplishments include: Watching the 5 most recent episodes of Late Night w/ Jimmy Fallon and sleeping on and off for about 12 or 14 hours.  As I ran out of Jimmy Fallon episodes to watch and read Eva fans going nuts over <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65" title="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65">Asuka's name change</a>, I thought about finally watching Evangelion 1.0.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 1: Finding a torrent</b></div><p>Finding a torrent for Evangelion 1.0 wasn't too difficult.  Though, my choices of which torrent to use was varied and confusing.  I finally picked one that had a decent amount of seeders and looked like an English language version.  It took about an hour or two to download.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 2: Playing the movie</b></div><p>The file I downloaded was a Matroska (MKV) file.  One of those ridiculous video formats that Anime geeks like because you can swap out subtitle files at your whim.  I thought I had means to play MKV files, but Media Player and DivX Player informed me that this was not the case.  <a href="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html" title="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html">Matroska dot Org</a> had the answers for me.  I downloaded a copy of Media Player Classic, and the video played perfectly. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 3: Subtitles</b></div><p>The torrent was kind enough to provide only the movie file.  So, when Shinji listened to the phone recording in the first moments of the film, it was in Japanese without the aid of subtitles.  It only took about 10 minutes of searching on Google to find a subtitle file.  (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf" title="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf">http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf</a>).  I opened up Evangelion 1.0 in Media Player Classic, set the subtitle file, and prepared to watch.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 4: Correcting the Subtitle file</b></div><p>Not every video file of Evangelion 1.0 is the same.  Some are recorded from a Camcorder in the theater.  Some are directly ripped from the DVD release.  Whatever the case, my copy of Evangelion 1.0 has about 32 seconds of Company IDs at the beginning before the film actually begins, which the subtitle file doesn't take into account.  So, Subtitles start to appear 32 seconds before any dialogue is said.</p><p>The whole beauty of the MKV format is that you can make your own subtitle files.  The subtitles aren't hardcoded on the video.  You can edit them.  So, I'll just fix the subtitle file by changing every time in it.  I'd do it by hand, except there are over 1000 lines of dialogue to change.  I could write a program much faster than I could do fix by hand.  Plus, it would be much more interesting.</p><p>So, that's what I did.  Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java">github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/EvaSubtitleFixer.java</a>.  If you want to use it, feel free. ^_^  You might want to change the ORIGINAL_LOCATION to whatever your subtitle file is called.  And change OFFSET_BY_SECONDS to however many seconds your subtitle file is off.  It'll plop a file called subtitles_fixes.srt in your C directory.</p><p>I guess this'll really only work with Subtitle files of the srt format.  I'm not sure how the other subtitle formats are designed.  I just took one look at the SRT file and figured out the pattern instantly.</p><p><i>Update: I wrote that code in a web application, so you can use it right now without needing any compilers or experience or whatever.  The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a><br/><br/><b>Success</b></p><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sakuracon-seattle-wa">SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, Kyle, Jesse and Myself flew out to Seattle, WA to attend <a href="http://www.sakuracon.org/" title="http://www.sakuracon.org/">Sakura-Con</a>, Seattle's premiere Anime Convention.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>One of the two days i've attending SPAMM this semester, Kyle queries, "say Dyre, Jesse and I were wondering if you'd be interested in flying out to Seattle for Sakura-Con this coming April."  I thought about it for a second, but that was all the time i needed before agreeing to their proposal.  "Hmmm...  that sounds like a great idea, there Kyle.  I'll definitely take a look into costs, planning and the like."</p><p>Going out to Seattle offered more than just an Anime convention.  SPAMM founders Ace and Jess had moved out there when Ace got a job working for Microsoft.  Also, another friend of ours, Hilary, lived in the 5 hour vicinity, too.  Plus, it's fricken Seattle.  I've wanted to go there ever since i graduated High School.  I'm not really sure how that came about..</p><p>Anywho, i got price quotes, hotel reservations, etc all set up.  Did a cost benefit analysis for our options, and everything seemed quite kosher.  Off we went.</p><div class='title'><b>Seattle, WA</b></div><p>I hardly did any research about what we were going to do in our downtime, but the little research i did just blew me away.  I had never actually looked at a map of Seattle, so i hit up google maps and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr"> typed it</a> in.</p><p>My god.  Even from the plain maps, it looked beautiful.  Vast amounts of lakes and rivers, covered the terrain.  This was all realized as our plane headed downward into the area:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" /></p><p>Cool Blue Lakes and Rivers, Lush Green Forests, White Tips of distant mountains..  and the Sky-scrapper center.  Seattle is all these things in one.</p><p>Once we landed, got our luggage, and rented a car, we set forth on the open roads.  The terrain was as green as it looked from the sky.  Despite the heavy amount of urbanization, Seattle maintained it's green roadside forests, and beautiful scenery, though the large shipyards took away from the natural scenery.  We drove up Hwy 5 towards downtown, but then took a detour East headed for Redmond.  The suburban areas kept itself grounded to the environment with heavy forests, mixed with houses, restaurants and other businesses.  We attempted to look for Microsoft Headquarters and Nintendo Headquarters, but were unable to trainspot them from the highway, nor the little suburban roundabout before heading back the direction we came.</p><p>Our cheap ass rental car felt like it was about to die, so we decided to get to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A"> hotel</a>, check-in, and then register for the Convention.</p><p>After doing such things, we got something to eat at The Islander in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1"> Pike Market Place</a> area.  It was some of the most delicious shrimp I've ever tasted.  We walked around the Pike Market Place a little more afterwards, and then headed back to the hotel.  Then i slept for 14 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday Afternoon</b></div><p>Saturday, i finally got around to calling everybody and we met up with Hilary for lunch in the International District.  We ate at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A"> Fu-Lin Chinese Restaurant</a>, where the Ramen actually tasted like ramen from the Cafeteria at Nagasaki GaiDai in all of its' bland, rubbery, waxy, noodley, fatty, yet tasty flavor.  In the same area, just happened to be an import toy / video game / model / figure store, entitled <a href="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php" title="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php">Pink Godzilla</a>.  It's interesting to see how much these import stores hike up the prices for the 'demand' in America.</p><p>I did end up purchasing Trigger Heart Exelica on the Dreamcast, though.  There was about a $5 markup compared to the Japanese price, so it wasn't really that big a rip.</p><div class='title'><b>Cultural Divide</b></div><p>Something that rather surprised me was how large the Asian population is in Seattle.  Out here in Madison and up in Minneapolis, you'll catch a couple Asian Americans around.  Perhaps a couple more actual Asians in the South Union area, but the vast majority is Caucasian and African American.  In Seattle, there's a greater balance of the 3.</p><p>Obviously, since we're on the West coast, this is the original landing point for most Asian immigrants.  It's real interesting to see some customs that have transfered over and similarities between Japan in particular.</p><p>From what Ace and Jess told us about the weather, the lowest the temperature ever gets is around 35 to 40, and the highest it has gotten for them was around the 90s.  This weather is nearly identical to Nagasaki, according to what I've experienced and what #five has told me.</p><p>The garbage is far more recycling friendly as well.  In Japan, you separate burnable, non-burnable, bottles and cans when you throw away your trash.  All the public places I've been in around the west just have one single Garbage can that you dump everything into.  However, Seattle has garbage divisions much like Japan, separated by normal trash, paper, cans, and bottles.  Almost every public garbage can i saw had these four divisions.  No wonder the environment looks so damn beautiful.</p><p>Also, Seattle has quite a bit of Sakura and White Plum trees.  I was rather disappointed that i missed out on Sakura trees blossoming in Japan, but Seattle made up for it with its own blossoming beauties.  I'm not sure why i didn't take any pictures.. :/  I suppose the similar weather and immigrants were responsible for the healthy Sakura population around the city.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakura-Con</b></div><p>Anyways, Saturday was the day that we really spent our time at the Con, unless you count the hour and a half spent in line the previous day.  Bigger Anime conventions always have a higher quantity and quality of cosplayers:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07935.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07935.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07935.webp" /></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07931.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07931.webp">Sonic</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07932.webp">Majora's Mask characters</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07933.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07933.webp">Gir</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07934.webp">Pyramid Head</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07936.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07936.webp">Haruko</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07937.webp">Nausicaa</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07939.webp">Faust</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07940.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07940.webp">Stephanie</a> from LazyTown.....</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07941.webp">Cleopatra</a> from Ouendan</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07942.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07942.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07942.webp" /></p><p>Shaolin Soccer Group..  I'm not quite who corresponds to who though.  Obviously, #10 is Stephen Chow, and the gloved guy is the goalie.  I suppose i could go back and double check their shirt numbers.</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07943.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07943.webp">Phoenix Wright</a> with perfect hair</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07944.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07944.webp">Blue Boy Link</a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07945.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07945.webp">Nurses</a> from Silent Hill</p><p>There were a few cosplayers i saw, but didn't get a chance to take pictures of.  Mainly the mailman from Twilight Princess and a huge costume of Robo from Chrono Trigger.  I'm sure you could just go over to that fan-something website and see them along with some of the other beautiful j-pop cosplayers.</p><p>Honestly, we really didn't do a whole lot at the Convention itself.  We walked around the dealer's room quite a bit.  Jesse not only got one of his Penny Arcade books signed by either Tycho or Gabe, but nearly defeated one of them in Puzzle Quest.  I also pissed off one of import game dealers commenting on his prices compared to those in Japan.</p><p>The gaming rooms were pretty disappointing.  Microsoft dominated one of the rooms with 360 stuff, while the other rooms had a ton of single player games.  Guilty Gear was the only traditionally fighting game present.  Dead or Alive 4 and, of course, Smash Brothers were the next closest :/  sadness...</p><div class='title'><b>As day turns to Night</b></div><p>All Saturday has been rather cloudy and rainy.  Ace and Jess confirmed that it did rain quite a bit, but never the down pours we experience in the Midwest.  The weather is usually overcast with a misty like rain that doesn't really get you wet..  So, you rarely get good beautiful days (like Friday), but you also rarely get snow, thunderstorms, and other severe weather.</p><p>After much decision making, we decided to go back to the fish Market, and go to Pike's place for dinner, where we had the most delicious meal of the trip.  I had stuffed Smoked Salmon with Spinach, along with several of their brewed beers.  Fantastic..</p><p>Afterwards, Ace and Jess showed us around to some of the attractions, such as the gum wall:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" /></p><p>A wall covered with used pieces of chewing gum.  I had no gum, so i was unable to contribute.  Back up the hill, was some lucky golden pig, which we had Kyle hop on:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07952.webp" /></p><p>We also visited Starbucks #1.

Jesse was somewhat regretful that we didn't spend enough time at the Convention.  After all, that was our main reason of going to Seattle.  I think my whole time of going to Anime Conventions is coming to an end.  I'm really only interesting in what the dealers are selling, and what games are available in the game room.  This Con really failed at both for me, despite its large size.  The cosplayers were rather fantastic though.</p><p>One reason that <a href="http://nobrandcon.com/" title="http://nobrandcon.com/">No Brand Con</a> trumps all other Anime Conventions i've attended is their phenomenal game room, surprising vendors, and the 'No Mercy' room which plays Bad Anime and J-Drama.  Plus No Brand Con is at such a small scale that you actually meet people and see them throughout the weekend, rather than just once.</p><p>Even though it was just a simple weekend, i'll definitely be back up there for the <a href="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/" title="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/">Penny Arcade Expo</a> at the end of August.  Perhaps this time, i'll find time to actual go out and listen to some music.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anime Video Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anime-video-games">Anime Video Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 28, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b><u>Sword of Berserk</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>Sword of Berserk was actually my first exposure to Berserk. i remember hearing about how violent the game was, so i picked it up one day at work to check it out. (at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to One Piece" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/one-piece">One Piece</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 7, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I've gotten current with One Piece and it seems like ever since they've made it to the Grand Line, the amount of characters who have consumed Devil's Fruit has risen much more than before.  Almost every person, friend or enemy, has a power. So, to keep 'em all straight I thought it'd keep track of all the Devil's Fruit that have been uncovered in the story line in order of appearance, for the most part.</p><p>I put all these details on <a href="/pages/one_piece.html" title="/pages/one_piece.html">this page</a>.</p><p>Luffy's fruit was uncovered in the first episode. And a couple episodes later, the next fruit was uncovered.  The next episode that mentions a different fruit is episode 49 when Alvida returns.  The first 50 episodes of the series has only 3 fruit. Then, the next 50 episodes have 11 fruit.  There were about 2 or 3 per story arc. </p><p>Speaking of story arcs, I made a list of those as well so when we show One Piece at SPAMM on the weekends, we could show the episodes of story arcs, rather than just a set number of episodes per week.</p><p>Episodes 1 : Luffy Intro<br/>Episodes 2 - 3 : Zoro Intro<br/>Episodes 4 - 8 : Captain Buggy<br/>Episodes 9 - 17 : Ussop Story<br/>Episodes 18 - 19 : Luffy & Zoro Story<br/>Episodes 20 - 30 : Sanji Story<br/>Episodes 31 - 44: Nami Story<br/>Episodes 45 - 53 : Buggy & Rogue Town<br/>Movie 2 : The Clockwork Island Adventure<br/>Episodes 54 - 61 : Apis & Dragon's Nest<br/>Episodes 62 - 63 : Laboon & Vivi Intro<br/>Episodes 64 - 67 : Whiskey Peak<br/>Episodes 68 - 69 : Coby Story<br/>Episodes 70 - 78 : Little Garden<br/>Episodes 79 - 91 : Chopper Story & Drum Kingdom<br/>Episodes 92 - ?? : Vivi & Alabasta<br/>Movie 3 : Rare Monster Island, Chopper's Kingdom</p><p>We'd really only be able to get through a certain amount of episodes each week.  And, by the looks of things, we'll probably need to cut in the middle of some of the story arcs, too.</p><p>Looks like the longest story arc in One Piece is 12 episodes long, and the average looks to be around 9 or 10. This is unlike Dragonball Z whose story arcs round out around 30 with main story arcs of 100 episodes.  One Piece has an overall story goal, but the story arcs round out well enough.</p><p>Ya know, the beginning of One Piece was quite fun and the fun continues on through the point they make it to the Grand Line (episode 61). But after that, the whole caliber of the series begins to drop. Before, the fights were more serious and had more emotion. Now it's become a joke. There hasn't been any contest at all. Luffy easily kicks their asses. No suspense, thats it. Hopefully when they fight Crocodile the 'intensity' will return.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/anime">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
