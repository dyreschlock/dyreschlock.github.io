| November 3, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nearly two years ago, Ghibli Park was first opened in the Aichi Commemorative Expo Park, northeast of Nagoya. Ghibli Park is an open-air museum of sorts, with replica houses, buildings, and environments from various works by Ghibli Film. In the center of it all, is the Ghibli Warehouse, which houses a museum, other exhibits, a theater, shops, and several other recreations of Ghibli works and history.</p><p>There are four open-air areas of the Ghibli Park, each require an advanced ticket to enter. Each area is spread around the Expo Park. Here's a map:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp"></a></p><p>In addition to the <span class="orange"><b>Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></b></span> in the middle, the <span class="light_blue"><b>Hill of Youth <span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></b></span> is near one of the main parking lots and the train station in the north. It's most likely the first area you'll come across. Near the other parking lot and to the south is <span class="olive"><b>Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'>どんどの森</span></b></span>. These were the first areas available when Ghibli Park first opened on November 1st, 2022. Since then, in November 2023, the <span class="purple"><b>Mononoke Village <span class='ja'>もののけの里</span></b></span> in the northeast was completed. And most centralized and most recently opened in March 2024 is the <span class="magenta"><b>Valley of Witches <span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></b></span>.</p><p>One of my friends visited the park a year or more ago, and said it wasn't all that special, but this is absolutely not the case. Seeing the scale of these areas in person is incredible. Climbing to the scenic lookout point, prior to the park's opening, and peering down at a life-size replica of Howl's Moving Castle brought up feelings that I didn't know I had.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" /></a></p><p>DAMN. That's it. That's fricken it! The madmen did it!</p><div class='title'><b>Tickets</b></div><p>Tickets for the Ghibli Park are all purchased in advance, online through Lawson. There are 4 different types of tickets available, with different levels of access to the park. The main tickets are purchases 2 months in advance, but there are last-minute tickets you can buy within 7 days prior to visit.</p><p>The standard ticket is the Grand Sanpo Pass, or Grand Walking Pass. This pass allows entrance to all four outdoor areas of Ghibli Park, and gives a specific entrance time to the Ghibli Warehouse. When you buy the ticket, the time you're choosing is when you can enter the Warehouse. You can enter any of the outside areas at anytime throughout the day. Tickets are 3500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>The second ticket is the Grand Sanpo Premium Pass. This also has a specific time for the Warehouse and allows entrance to all four outdoor areas. The Premium part allows entrance to specific buildings inside of the areas, including Mei & Satsuki's Home, the Earth Antique Store, Okino's Residence, the Witch's Home, and Howl's Moving Castle. Without a premium pass, you cannot enter these buildings. This ticket is 7300<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>There's a third ticket which only includes access to Mononoke Village, The Valley of Witches, and all buildings in the Valley of Witches. Because these two areas are recent additions to the Ghibli Park, they created a new ticket just for people who had visited in the first year. This ticket is 3300<span class='ja'>円</span>, and I think it will only be available temporarily for a little while longer.</p><p>The final type of ticket is the last-minute Sanpo Pass. This ticket can only be purchased 7 days before your arrival, and it only includes the 4 outdoor areas of the park. There's no access to buildings, and no access to the Ghibli Warehouse. Also, you only have 3 hours to use your tickets to enter the areas. This ticket is only 1500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>I purchased the 3500<span class='ja'>円</span> Grand Sanpo Pass for November 1st, the 2-year anniversary of the park's opening. The Premium Pass sold out too quickly for me to buy, but there seemed like a lot to do already. There were so many places to go and see. I wanted this trip to be more of a dry run rather than an exhaustive one. My warehouse entry time was Noon.</p><div class='title'><b>Open and Opening</b></div><p>Despite Ghibli Park's website clearly stating that there is absolutely no parking, there was plenty of parking. I think they state this based on a technicality that Ghibli Park itself has no dedicated parking, but the Expo Park has plenty. </p><p>While Ghibli Park is the main draw (and often only draw) for the Expo Park, Ghibli Park still treats itself part of the area, rather than the whole thing. As such, the park is almost completely open. I arrived at around 8:30am, well before the 10am opening time. I was planning on sitting in my car, and going through photos. But, so many people were walking in after they parked.</p><p>Unlike a typical theme park or museum, there is no gate, and no perimeter closing the park off to people who didn't have tickets.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The bell tower elevator was completely open. Just hop in, and go down to the park area without showing a ticket or anything. I kept looking around for where I needed to scan my ticket or what I needed to do.</p><p>Each of the specific areas of Ghibli Park are ticketed, but the entire park itself is completely open. You don't need a ticket to walk around the park! Plus, there are a lot of things you can do and see without even having a ticket.</p><p>Opening around 9am was the observation point. I walked up to the top, and it gave a full view of the Valley of Witches, the newest and largest addition to the park. Again, no ticket required.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>No one was yet around, but some of the buildings were being prepared for today's crowds.</p><p>From the observation point, I walked down through the other path which led to the Mononoke Village. I got yelled at for entering the area even though it was all open. So, I walked around the park for a while and got a good idea of the overall layout.

The Mononoke Village had an Ashitaka hat, like the one in the film, some plushies, and some pins and buttons. </p><p>Every area has a button badge that matches the art from the website. The buttons are only 300<span class='ja'>円</span>, so it's not too expensive to hunt down the full set by doing to each area.</p><p><i>Spoilers</i>, but I was able to collect them all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Collecting each of the buttons was a lot like a stamp rally. It was fun hunting them down, although the process certainly prays of my sense of consumerism. Many of the gift shops have lines, so while you wait to buy the buttons, you're also tempted to buy other stuff too. </p><p>Because of the exclusive merchandise, throughout all of Ghibli Park, I ended up buying things from 7 different gift shops. My main gets are pictured above: the buttons and the Ghibli Park Guide Book. I bought a bunch of other things as Christmas Presents.</p><p>Note: Even though there are photo icons or badges of the premium areas on the website, there are no button badges for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Cat Castle Playground <span class='ja'>猫の城遊具</span></b></div><p>Just outside of the Mononoke Village is a non-ticket area called the Cat Castle Playground.

By walking through the gate and greeting the stone statue, you can take the steep, casual, or middle course going up the hill, and back down the other side. Alternatively, you could also take the cat bus from the station in front of Mononoke Village to the other side of the park. I didn't realize this at the time, but I'm more of a walker, anyway.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="olive">Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'>どんどこ森</span></span></b></div><p>The Dondoko Forest is one of the more barebones areas in the park. Once you enter through the gate, you have the option of walking or taking the tram to the top of the hill. I walked. But, I also got a little lost in the forest. Signage is not so great. At the top, you're greeted by a Totoro statue, and the gift shop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Totoro statue acts like a shrine to commemorate your ascent of the hill.

Maybe an oversight on my part, but I did not eat anything in the park, at all. I had a pizza in my car from visiting Costco the day before, so I already had more food than I needed. I'll do more of a food journey on my next trip.</p><p>The road leading into the main area slowly reveals more and more buildings of the town. The first building is The Witch's Home, from Earwig and the Witch. This is the home where Bella Yaga and Mandarake live, and bring Earwig after they adopt her. This home is part of the premium pass, so I could not enter.</p><p>The road continues passed a fountain and some more buildings. There's a building with a confusing layout that is inspired by a boy who dreams of flying, like the puzzles in Laputa or Kiki. I didn't really notice any strong references. </p><p>Next to this building is the valley's Clock Tower.

| September 20, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Legend of Crystania is a film that has had a significant impact on me. Unlike any of movie, it wasn't because of the story, characters, art, or music. It was because, 14 years ago, my college friends and I and over 25 members of our college anime club, SPAMM, created a feature length fandub of the film. To this day, I have yet to know anything about the official story or characters other than it's connection to Lodoss War.</p><p>Our film was entitled The Secret of Crystania, and you can view it here: <br/><b><a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">theschlock.com/the-secret-of-crystania</a></b></p><p>Every since moving to Japan, I often go to Yahoo Auctions and when I'm there, I always search for Crystania. Over the last 10 years, many pieces of Crystania memorabilia has surfaced. Usually the prices are very cheap compared to well known anime productions of the time, so buying these things has worked on quite well. Recently, some very interesting things has shown up there, too.</p><p>I have scanned in all of my memorabilia, and you can take a look at it all below.</p><div class='title'><b>Theatrical Run Items</b></div><p>The Legend of Crystania premiered in Japanese theaters during the Tsunogawa Anime Festival on July 29th, 1995. It was part of a double feature along with the Slayers movie. Obviously, Slayers was incredibly popular, so people were basically suckered into seeing Crystania, too.</p><p>I have found a ticket from that event, which has a March 27th, 1995 date on it for some reason. Were they selling tickets that far in advance? Looking around all tickets have that date on them. I don't know why.</p><p>Additionally, I found a flyer for the premiere event as well as a film pamphlet. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As films release in Japan, theaters will sell a pamphlet book of the film with shots from the film, story explanation, and occasionally production notes, interviews, and other behind the scenes stuff. This particular book also has several pages of ads for additional Crystania mechandise. Most of the time these books are sold, but maybe these were given away with the premiere. I've scanned the pamphlet and the flyer and included them below.</p><p>Legend of Crystania - Film Pamphlet (20 pages)<br/><span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span> <span class='ja'>パンフレット</span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/">https://drive.google.com/.../1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm</a></p><p>Slayers / Legend of Crystania Premiere Flyer<br/><span class='ja'>スレイヤーズ</span> <span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span> <span class='ja'>映画</span> <span class='ja'>チラシ</span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/">https://drive.google.com/.../1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy</a></p><div class='title'><b>Home Release Items</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original home release of Legend of Crystania was on VHS in Japan on March 8th, 1996. But, it was a decaying format and LaserDisc was the new hotness. LaserDisc took an incredible hold in Japan and almost all the modern popular anime releases got a LaserDisc release through the late 90s. The LaserDisc version of Crystania was released on March 23rd, 1996, and by the end of the year, the 3-part 6-episode OAV sequel was released on LaserDisc, too.</p><p>The LaserDisc version of Legend of Crystania is the most high quality release to date. In America, we got a DVD version in 2000, but the DVD version released by ADV was a transfer of the LaserDisc. Additionally, the American DVD has subtitles and other English edits burned directly onto the video. This cuts out some of the original video.</p><p>I picked up two copies of the movie as they weren't too expensive.</p><p>The VHS tape shows up on Yahoo Auctions from time to time, but I think it's unnecessary to own since the LaserDisc is the definitive version.</p><div class='title'><b>Animation Cels</b></div><p>Around 7 years ago, as I was looking through Yahoo Auctions, I first searched for Crystania and saw that some was selling animation cels. I had always dreamed or had a fantasy of owning animation cels of Crystania, but owning such things seemed incredible cost prohibited in my mind, considering cels of popular shows go for hundreds of dollars.  </p><p>Luckily, Crystania is not popular, nor even really all that good. I purchased my first cels and posted about it here: <a href="/old/v7/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania" title="/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania">theschlock.com/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania</a>.</p><p>The years went on, and occasionally more and more cels would appear on Yahoo Auctions. Today, I own 15 cels from the film. I have scanned them all, and added them in the gallery below.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Production Collections</b></div><p>Recently, these two items appeared on Yahoo Auctions and I immediately put all of my money behind acquiring them.

Sometimes as a collector, you have some items or something that you always keep in the back of your mind, but never really ever hope in actually finding.  You never really go searching for it anymore because you've hit too many dead ends, and it becomes more of a waste of time than anything else.</p><p>About a week ago, I had some free time on the Internet and randomly decided to search for "Crystania" on yahoo auctions.  After paging through manga, single CDs, and other crap related to the RPG, I came across the very items that I never thought I would actually be able to find..</p><p>Animation cels from The Legend of Crystania.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Why would anyone want something from this shit anime?  Well, it's not the anime itself that's important, but that my friends and I re-wrote, and re-dubbed the movie over 10 years ago as part of our anime club in college.  Really, even calling it "The Legend of Crystania" feels weird as "The Secret of Crystania" is the real treasure.  Honestly, to this day, I still don't know the actual names of the characters other than Ashram and Pirotess.</p><p>We originally finished and screened The Secret on March 6th, 2006, so it was only last week that we hit the 10 year anniversary of our project's "completion."  If you'd like to give it a watch, take a look it this page: <a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">The Secret of Crystania</a>.</p><p>Among these 4 cels we have the main character, Billy Winchester, and the girl, Agora Miasma, whose name is never uttered in the film.

I'll go through all my channels before I simply give up, once again.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hideaki Anno's Sci Fi Exhibit - Tokusatsu 特撮" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hideaki-anno-scifi-exhibit-tokusatsu">Hideaki Anno's Sci Fi Exhibit - Tokusatsu 特撮</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Published in 2005, this is a 536 page book featuring very lengthy interviews with almost everyone remotely noteworthy who has ever been a part of <b>Gainax</b>.</p><p>For those who don't know, Gainax is a Japanese Animation Studio responsibility for such anime movies and television shows as <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, <b>Gunbuster</b>, <b>Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water</b>, <b>Neon Genesis Evangelion</b>, <b>His and Her Circumstances</b>, <b>FLCL</b>, <b>Gurren Lagann</b>, <b>Panty and Stocking</b>, and a couple others, mostly maid anime.</p><p>I've been a fan of Gainax ever since I first watched Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Akira initially showed me how detailed and brutal Japanese animation can be, but Evangelion showed me the amount of depth most anime go into when describing and building a character while still having some amazing animated scenes.</p><p>I watched their other work, and they continued to impress and amaze me.  More over, I began completely amazed by the director and chief creative input behind many of their shows, Hideaki Anno.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp"  /></p><p>The book has a sizable interview with him.  I can't really read Japanese (yet), but above the specific question deals with the work he did before he, Takeda, Masayuki, and Higuchi banded together to form Gainax.  He worked as a key animation on the Gundam series for Sunrise, and, as the photo in the corner indicates, he got his big break key animating the God Warrior scene at the end of Ghibli's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.</p><p>Aside from Anno, the book focuses on the interviews of 15 people who helped shape Gainax throughout the years.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp"  /></p><p><b>Yasuhiro TAKEDA</b> : co-founder, general manager<br/><b>Hideaki ANNO</b> : co-founder, creator of Evangelion, director of Evangelion, Nadia, Gunbuster, His and Her Circumstances, and some others<br/><b>Masayuki</b> : assistant and alternate director of Evangelion<br/><b>Yoshiyuki SADAMOTO</b> : co-founder, character designer for Honneamise, Evangelion, Nadia<br/><b>Toshimichi OHTSUKI</b> : producer of Evangelion, FLCL<br/><b>Hiroki SATO</b> : producer of FLCL and most of their maid anime shows<br/><b>Masahiko OHTSUKI</b> : technical director of FLCL, Evangelion, and some others<br/><b>Shinji HIGUCHI</b> : co-founder, storyboards and special effects for Honneamise, Gunbuster, Evangelion.

All of which I can't really read at the moment. :(</p><p>This is very similar to another book I own, but from a single point of view.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp"  /></p><p>The Notenki Memoirs is written by one of the co-founders of Gainax, Yasuhiro Takeda, and from the way he writes about it, it seems that he's the responsible one of the four main founders.  Originally published in 2002 in Japan, ADV translated and brought this book over in 2005.</p><p>Takeda talks about meeting Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and Shinji Higuchi in college, and forming an Anime club.  Together they, and a couple other members, worked on an opening animation for the upcoming Sci Fi convention being held in Osaka that year, Daicon III.  The year was 1981.</p><p>The way he talks and reminiscences about their work on Daicon III reminds me of my own time in college in my own anime club, SPAMM, as we worked on a film of our own, The Secret of Crystania (which is really a fandub, not a complete original work).  And much like both of our projects, they were finished only an hour or two before it aired to the public.</p><p>You can view the whole short film on Youtube, as well as the amazing sequel, Daicon IV, that they did 2 years later.</p><p>Daicon III : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c</a><br/>Daicon IV : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE</a></p><p>With the completion of Daicon IV, they founded Daicon Film which specialized in special effects and animation. Later on, the special effects business splintered off, and the remnants became <b>Gainax</b>. In the beginning, the mostly did animation work for Sunrise (Gundam), but later created original works that I mentioned above.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway...</b></div><p>The Gainax Interviews looks like a fascinating read into the history of my favorite Anime studio, and I look forward to reading it someday.  It's my goal to someday have enough knowledge of the Japanese language to actually read this thing.  Maybe, at that time, I'll actually work to translate the whole thing since it doesn't seem like a translation exists.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM T-Shirt 2012" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-tshirts">SPAMM T-Shirt 2012</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The theme, as always, was to incorporate the annually elected mascot into the design somehow.  The 2012 mascot were two cats from some anime I've never heard of, or care about.</p><p>This is the first design I've done since 2006, so take a look!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" /></p><p>I think this really incorporates the current state of SPAMM and anime as a whole.  Unfortunately, no one is current SPAMM voted for it, so it did not make it on a t-shirt.  We could make our own, though.</p><p>Also, the design technically isn't finished because it doesn't have a logo, or a title.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>While in college, I was a member and president of the anime club known as SPAMM.  In 2003, we began making yearly t-shirts of our yearly mascot, and for the first 4 years I drew the design for each t-shirt.  Then I graduated, and the club went on without me.</p><p>There's a somewhat growing reverence towards the newer generation of SPAMM kids, and how they have terrible taste in anime, and how they don't give a shit about alumni members, and blah blah blah.  It's all very "get off my lawn" for the most part.</p><p>But anyway, here are my previous SPAMM t-shirt design going back in time.</p><p>For the sake of timeline continuity, it's important to note that SPAMM elections for officers and the mascot are in May.  Then that mascot covers the following school year.</p><p>Also, my drawing style changed a little bit over the years.  I began experimenting with heavier lines, and more ink to show more definition for parts of the subject that weren't showing up well.  This really made things pop and stand up, especially for a simple two tone image.  It began looking a little bit like a black and white comic book.</p><p>I developed this style through these yearly designs, and that's basically where I'm at now.  I don't draw very often, though.</p><div class='title'><b>2006-2007 Year of Mina</b></div><p>I graduated in December 2006, and that final semester was spent in Japan, so I wasn't really even around at all.  This design was really the last creative contribution I had with SPAMM with our movie "completely" wrapped up.</p><p>Mina was our character this year.  She is from the opening sequence of Densha Otoko, a J-Drama about an otaku, anime geek, who stood up for a "hot" girl on a train, he gets her number, and then details everything on the internet while asking for advice from like-minded otaku.</p><p>She only appears in the opening, which pays homage to Daicon IV, an animation produced by a group of nerds in college who would later create and found Gainax, and make Evangelion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2005-2006 Year of Katamari</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy was released in late 2004 in the states, and it was hugely popular amongst the members of SPAMM.  It easily won the vote of mascot for the fully school term.</p><p>For this drawing, I tried to incorporate tons of objects relating to anime, or Japan, or Platteville, or SPAMM in general.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2004-2005 Year of Guvava</b></div><p>On the schedule and showing throughout the entire 2003-2004 school year was <b>Macross 7</b>.  An anime that follows the war between the humans and the protoculture.  It was discovered that the protoculture (or whatever) could be defeated by music, so the band, Fire Bomber, flies around in mechs in space, and defeats the enemy by playing their music over and over again.</p><p>Guvuva is the little furry creature that hangs around the girl character.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2003-2004 Year of Domo-kun</b></div><p>This was the first year we did t-shirts.  Up to this point, I don't think we even had elections for the SPAMM mascot, or entity.  If we did, we never did anything with it.</p><p>After Jason won the election for SPAMM president, he wanted to make t-shirts, so we had a vote for an entity on the t-shirt.  Domo-kun won.  Then I offered to make the t-shirt, or they asked me to make the design.  I was the publicity officer, who was in charge of advertisement, so the basically fell on my role.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Printing</b></div><p>For all these t-shirts, we just used the local screen printing shop in town.  We pre-sold t-shirts for $10 (or was it $5?), then brought all of our stuff there.  I really don't remember how much it cost, or how many we needed to sell to break even.  The treasurer was in charge of all that.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sakamichi no Apollon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sakamichi-no-apollon">Sakamichi no Apollon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><b>Sakamichi no Apollon</b>, or otherwise known as Kids of the Slope, is a new anime currently airing in Japan.  It started on April 12th, and only 4 episodes have aired so far.  After college, I really haven't watched much Anime, but what initially caught my eye was the return of Shinichiro Watanabe and Yokko Kano teaming up again.</p><p>The two of them have been responsible for such Anime as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.  Not my favorites, but are very solid, enjoyable and landmark series in their own right.  Both those series make a high importance of music which completely sets the tone for the series as a whole.  And Apollon certainly follows suit.</p><p>Sakamichi no Apollon centers on Jazz.  And it's use of music is much more tangible and important to the story.  For Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo is was simply background and tone, but for Sakamichi no Apollon it's what brings all the characters together.  Performing the music is what bring these characters out of their shells and into life.</p><p>Also, Sakamichi no Apollon is completely different genre of Anime than the other two.  It's a serialized slice-of-life drama, not a comedic episodic action adventure.  It's down to earth, and focuses on the actual characters, rather than action or whatever.</p><p>And I like it quite a bit. :D  It's been quite a while since I've actually been into a new Anime.  So long so that I don't even remember the last one I really liked.</p><p>Anywho, there are 2 things that I find interesting about the show beyond just the characters and that's the setting and the time period.</p><div class='title'><b>The Time Period</b></div><p>I didn't really notice this at all until the most recent episode, the 4th episode.  Apollon does not take place in modern day.  There have been plenty of subtle hints throughout the show.  No one uses a cellphone, and all the cars are vintage.</p><p>But I didn't start fully questioning it until the group of characters play their first gig, and a drunken American member of the audience makes such racist statements about the music they're playing.  Not racist against the Japanese, but racist against black people.  Not to say that racism doesn't exist today, but the tone and particular outburst did not feel of this time.</p><p>So, I looked it up, and yes indeed, Sakamichi no Apollon takes place in the year 1966.</p><p>This might explain why so many casual people are into Jazz.  I figured it was just some stupid Anime plot device that everyone knew about Jazz, and they were interested in it.  But, I'm starting to think that Jazz definitely had its market around that time.</p><p>Also, this explains why the main character was looking to buy classical and jazz records in the first episode, rather than a CD or just buying it online.  Though, I chalked that one up to best Jazz songs and albums are probably only available on their original format, vinyl.</p><div class='title'><b>The Location</b></div><p>One thing that really caught my attention in the first episode was that this story takes place in Kyushu.  Kyushu is the south western island of Japan, and is where I studied abroad, many of my friends studied abroad, and many of my friends live.  I'd like to know wherein Kyushu Sakamichi no Apollon takes place, but it doesn't seem to make mention of it.  I have a guess of where it could take place, but that could be my limited knowledge of the island as a whole.</p><p>Two of the characters are Catholic.  In the second episode Ritsuko and Sentaro attend church on Sunday, and then discuss their religion a little bit with the main character, Kaoru.  The introduction and expansion of Catholicism (and Christianity) in Japan started in Kagoshima and Nagasaki as trade with the dutch expanded.  Five and I watched the first 4 episodes over the weekend, and he made mention that he wondered if the popularity of western religion made it further than Kyushu before the Japanese government attempted to eradicate it.  In other words, to be a Japanese Catholic (or Christian) is a very Kyushu thing.</p><p>The second thing that my guess of setting is based on brings us back to the racist American in episode 4.  That entire scene happens in a Jazz bar near an American naval base.  The audience members are nearly all American sailors.  I think Okinawa is the most widely known about American Military base in Japan, and while technically it's part of Kyushu, I don't think the Japanese would call it Kyushu.</p><p>I think Sakamichi no Apollon takes place in <b>Sasebo</b>.  Sasebo has one of the largest American naval bases in Japan, and is not too far north of Nagasaki, so it's in the heart of Catholic and Christian expansion in Japan.  Looking up a few things on Google reveals that the Sasebo Tourist Center and the Sasebo High School have credits in Sakamichi no Apollon for Location Cooperation (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13944" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13944">credits</a>).</p><p>So, I'm right! :D</p><p>One of my good friends lives in Sasebo, too, so it's brings this show a bit closer to home for me, as well.</p><p>Something else that came about watching the show with Five was the use of Kyushu dialect by the characters.  I mean, aside from the main character, everyone lives and grew up in Kyushu so it makes sense that would have the accents.  Five was easily able to catch this as he lived in Nagasaki for 4 or 5 years, and worked in Omura (halfway between Nagasaki and Sasebo) for 2 or 3 years.  He mentioned that the dialect was present here and there, but it wasn't as strong as it should be.</p><p>It makes sense why they would do that for TV.  Almost all TV in Japan comes from Tokyo, so the Tokyo area dialect has become a standard for any television presence.  I'm guessing that they're shoving some Kyushu dialect in here and there to make it sound like it's from Kyushu, but still keeping it in line with the standard Tokyo TV dialect.</p><div class='title'><b>Good Stuff</b></div><p>Anywho, I like this show quite a bit, and can't wait to watch more of it.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.0 Street Date Broken" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-10-street-date-broken">Evangelion 1.0 Street Date Broken</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In September 2007, Gainax and Studio Khara released the 1st of the Rebuild of Evangelion quadrilogy.  North American licensing will still up in the air, at this point.  Many Anime fans wondered if ADV could pick up the rights?  Perhaps Manga entertainment would paid a shitload of money for the previous movies?</p><div class='title'><b>When?</b></div><p>Over a year had passed after its theatrical release and STILL no American Anime company had bought the rights..  It had already been out on DVD in Japan since April, and there were no signs it was even coming to America until Funimation (of all Anime companies) issued a cease and desist order to fansubbers in November 2008.  It wasn't until December 31st, 2008 that they official stated they had the domestic rights.</p><p>One day in March 2009, with the anticipation of Evangelion 2.0, I finally decided to <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">download and watch Evangelion 1.0</a>.  <a href="/old/v7/rebuild-of-evangelion" title="/rebuild-of-evangelion">And it was fantastic.</a> ^_^  In May 2009, <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone" title="/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">the Bluray</a> was finally released, and I bought it because I wanted to see the movie in absolute clarity.  Funimation, still dragging their feet, finally announced the voice cast around the same day the Bluray released in Japan.</p><p>In June 2009, Evangelion 2.0 was released in theaters and earned $5 million in 2 days showing on only 120 screens.  Each theater showing the movie earned about $40,000 for those 2 days. [<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen">link</a>]  It was so successful that Studio Khara now has a blank check for making the final 2 movies in the series. [<a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/">link</a>]  The marketing for Evangelion 2.0 was all over the place in Japan and it worked fantastically.</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 1.0 under-performing in America</b></div><p>Evangelion 2.0's success is a stark contrast to Funimation's handling of Evangelion 1.0.  Evangelion 1.0 has been complete since September, and they've been showing it in several theaters across the states, but it's doing terribly.  Their "theatrical" run has made a pathetic $100,000, so far. [<a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm" title="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm">link</a>]</p><p>There could be other reasons why Evangelion is under performing in the states, though.  For me, Evangelion is my Star Wars.  It's a cultural icon of my past and has influenced that way I have viewed Anime since then.  I think many Japanese people feel the same way, which is why it's such a huge success over there.  The shared experience of a generation of Anime fans, reuniting with the new generation.</p><p>It doesn't garner the same mass fandom over here, because Evangelion was released when Anime was still quite niche in America.  The kids in the know and super fans definitely saw it and probably loved it.  The first time I saw the series all the way through, I was a fan for life.  But the only way to see it, was the buy the VHS tapes which sold for $30 each and had 2 episodes.  That's almost $400.  That's way too much for any high school kid to pay.  That's really why Anime clubs began..</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion in Chicago</b></div><p>Anyways, Evangelion 1.0 has finally come to America and more specific it's showing in Chicago this whole week at The Music Box. [<a href="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion" title="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion">link</a>]. Some friends and I went down there yesterday.  Man, I was so excited!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp"  /></p><p>I don't think they could've been showing a more appropriate complementary movie alongside Evangelion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp"  /></p><p>I like how Funimation just sent the theater a cheap poster that's not even Movie Poster size.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp"  /></p><p>The Music Box has two theaters inside of it.  I wonder if their other theater is just as small as this one.  I doubt it could fit more than 200 people, and there were about 30 of us in there.  We were all Anime fans.  There were several people wearing Evangelion Tshirts too, which was pretty awesome. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>English Dubbed</b></div><p>I really had no idea if they were showing Evangelion with english subtitles or with the english dubbed track.  I don't know why, but I was actually surprised it was the English Dub.  I was actually pretty thankful because I had already watched the movie in Japanese at least a dozen times that this is actually something new!</p><p>Holy Shit!  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">The dub is hysterical.</span> Not just hysterical, but "font-weight: bold, font-size: 20px" hysterical.  <b>Funimation's Evangelion 1.0 puts Secret of Crystania to shame</b>.  In fact, there are several instances where there are DIRECT quotes from Crystania in Evangelion.  "If you're going to do it, do it now!", "You just don't get it, do you?" (Though, I guess those quotes are pretty generic.)Â   There were so many parts that were embarrassingly goofy, and I just couldn't stop but laugh.</p><p>If you thought Shinji was a whiny bitch in the original Dub of the series, Spike Spencer (the voice) brings it to a level you never thought possible.  It's so bad, there's no one that could possibly take it seriously.  You can't.  It's not serious.  It can't be serious.  His acting has got to be a ridiculous parody.</p><p>And it was fantastic that everyone in theater was on the same page.  I've never seen a movie where the audience was exactly in sync with the movie.  We laughed at the ridiculous acting.  We laughed at the parts that were supposed to be funny.  And were silent and polite when important stuff was going on.  It was like SPAMM, actually.</p><div class='title'><b>It's not that bad, though</b></div><p>Overall, the acting is pretty hilarious, but Allison Keith does a fantastic job with Misato.  Actually, Brina Palencia is really good as Rei, too, but Misato stands out because she's the one character with the most distinct personality in the entire movie.  It's so strong that it really feels like Misato in the main character.  She's the Han Solo to Shinji's whiny Luke Skywalker.  Which would make Pen Pen Chewbacca... i guess.</p><p>Though, her acting is only accented by the rather well done English script.  There were really just two parts that seemed lost in translation.  Though, that could have been because it was acted poorly.  But really, everything else made perfect sense and flowed quite well.  They did a great job keeping the script original and better written than the original series.  The writers definitely didn't half-ass the script.  They left the half-assing to the voice acters.</p><p>Evangelion 1.0 really does stand on its own as a movie, but leaves several hints towards the quadrilogy as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>North American DVD Release!</b></div><p>On November 17th, 2009 (3 weeks from now), Evangelion 1.0 will finally be released on DVD in North America.  Unfortunately, the Bluray won't be released until Spring 2010. [<a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/">link</a>].  By then, Evangelion 2.0 should be out on Bluray in Japan.</p><p>They're following a similar release schedule for the original Japanese release.  The first DVD release was entitled Evangelion 1.01.  They cleaned up a couple areas of the film, but in general it was identical to the theatrical release.  Later on, with the Bluray release, it was Evangelion 1.11, which contains some new scenes in there somewhere.  They fixed a few more areas of the film, and added 3 minutes to the beginning.  It is the best-selling Bluray in Japan to date at 49,000 copies (one of which is mine!).

| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For those who don't know, Evangelion is one of, if not THE, most popular Anime series in Japan.  My pal Justin and I started on the ground floor of its popularity in the US back when it was first being released in 1997 and 1998.  It's the series that put American Anime distributor and localizer ADV Films into a shit load of cash.</p><p>It original aired on Japanese TV in 1995 for a total of 26 episodes.  The final two episodes lead to a bit of an outcry by fans at to what the fuck creator Hideaki Anno was thinking.  Budgetary restraints kept the final two episodes very cheap.  Episodes were poorly animated, but kept a pencil drawing type scheme which looked "artsy".</p><p>Despite everyone hating these two episodes, I liked them.  These two episodes got rid of all the other distractions of plot, military, espionage, and other characters, Anno picked the most important aspect of the show and completely focused on it for the ending: Shinji.</p><p>I think most people (especially Americans) hate this because Shinji constantly whines about responsibility, is spineless, and feels he has no worth.  Americans don't give a shit about a coward for a main character.  Especially whens there's explosions and robots everywhere else in the show. The ending shows how Shinji finally over comes all the fears of himself and becomes confident.  "Good job, Shinji!"</p><p>But no.  The fans were outraged!  As such, Hideaki Anno created an alternate ending which replaced those two episodes which kept Shinji spineless and afraid.  And allowed Seele to completely control him and absolutely reset humanity.  Fans didn't know what to think of this ending.  But they got some amazing action sequences, so most of them consider it the better ending.</p><p>Blah blah blah...</p><div class='title'><b>But this is not how it happened!</b></div><p>With two endings to his story, neither of which does a good job of ending the series, Anno has returned.  He's making 4 "all new" movies to tell Evangelion as it was meant to be told.  The <b>Rebuild of Evangelion</b> is a complete re-imagining of the story from start to finish with a completely different ending that satisfies all aspects of the story.  (or so we've been told).</p><p>The first 2 movies will mostly be direct remakes of the original episodes.  Eva 3.0 will begin diverging and take the story to its new ending.  And Eva Final will put an end to everything Evangelion.</p><p>What I've been watching since March is the first movie, entitled...</p><p><b>Evangelion 1.0 You are (not) alone</b> SPOILERS, btw</p><p>This movie remakes episodes 1 through 6 of the original series.  During the episodes Shinji fights 3 Angels ("of death"): Sachiel, Shamshel, and Ramiel.  The plot, themes and whatnot are absolutely identical in both the series and this movie.  One might think that this is the stupidest thing ever.  Especially when the first 18 minutes of the film is almost an exact shot-by-shot update to the original animation.  <b>The genius of the movie is the pacing.</b></p><p>There really is no tension when Shinji fights Sachiel and Shamshel because the scenes are nearly the same as the original and the fans already know what's going to happen.  Sure, it looks prettier but the fights are the same.  Plus, after Shamshel you have that long boring part where Shinji runs away and nothing really happens.</p><p>Then Ramiel appears.  Ramiel is a bit shinier, but still looks the same...  until..</p><p><object width="640" height="505" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p><p>Holy shit.  That's different.  Ramiel is absolutely menacing.  Ramiel is pretty abstract to begin with, but now his attacks show the full force of his destructive power.</p><p>We still know what happens, but the Ramiel fight takes center stage.  I immediately shot awake and continued watching with my eyes glued to the screen.  Ramiel is far more dangerous than I remember him...  maybe in Evangelion 1.0, Ramiel actually does win.  How the hell are they going to stop this thing?</p><p>Unlike the series where this is just another episode, the movie builds up to this point and flourishes.  Shinji's own confidence builds to this point as well.  He's beginning to think about why he should pilot Evangelion, rather than doing what he's told.  Both plot lines balance in harmony as Shinji fires upon Ramiel to prove his worth.</p><p>With the ending of Evangelion 1.0, Hideaki Anno proves that both plots with Shinji and Evangelion can co-exist and satisfies both camps who prefer either ending of the original.</p><p>Stay tuned in November for the American release!</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 2.0 You can (not) advance</b></div><p>Let the speculation begin.  Eva 2.0 is released in Japanese theaters on Sat June 27th.  Shots from the trailer feature Angels all the way up to Zeruel, the 14th Angel.  As such, apparently this movie will cover episodes 7 all the way through 19, which is TWICE the amount as the first movie.  That's a shit load of ground to cover.  Especially when these episodes feature FAR more story than anything that went on in the first 6 episodes.</p><p>I have no idea how they plan to cram everything into 2 hours, but I guess we'll see!</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/anime/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
