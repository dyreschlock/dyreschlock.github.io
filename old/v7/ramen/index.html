I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.</p><p>With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen.

| March 4, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Tonight! Madison's first ever Ramen restaurant has its grand opening to the public.  It's located on 923 Willy Street, and leading up to its grand opening, they've been having a couple "soft" opening dates this week.  Along with Kyle and Skatje, I attended their soft opening last night, and tried a couple of their dishes.</p><p>The crew of Umami converted an old house that had been on the 900 block since the 1880s into their restaurant.  The outside still has the structure and look at the original house.  But inside is very different.  Inside eminates the feeling of a trendy restaurant you'd find in the downtown area of any urban sprawl.  Piano music plays in the background.  Solid colors of maroon, yellow, and white splash the walls.  The entire place is very clean, stoic and prestine, but the colors bring life to it.</p><p>It's actually nothing like a Ramen restaurant at all.  It's what I'd expect some trendy American Sushi place to be like.  The only Ramen restaurants that I've been to in America have been Japanese owned and operated.  They were ethnic through and through.  This place is just a little too good for Ramen.  Ramen is basically junk food.  Delicious, Amazing junk food.  It's designed to give you a shit load of calories FAST so you can return to work full of energy.  (Or a fantastic drunken snack.)  It has the same status symbol as a Hot Dog.  It's not some delicate menu item, like Sushi.</p><p>This just feels...  wrong.  And the menu prices compliment the trendy nature of the place.  They serve 3 types of Ramen at Umami: Vegetable, Miso, and Tonkotsu, which are $10, $10 and $12 respectively.  It's really the most I've ever paid for a single bowl of Ramen in my life.  Mitsuwa's Ramen restaurant charges $8 that comes complete with a bunch of other delicious goodies.</p><p>I tried their Miso Ramen, and was rather underwhelmed.  This wasn't really Miso Ramen.  They used chicken stock rather than an actual miso base.  Also, the noodles tasted undercooked, but they weren't terrible.  If I made Ramen from stratch, this is probably what it would taste like.  Definitely not authentic, but good enough.  Unfortunately, "Good Enough" does not warrant a $10 price tag.  It don't really care if it's authentic, but it should taste just as good.</p><p>In addition, to the Miso Ramen, I had their Vegetable Dumplings, which were pretty good.  I think they were filled with carrots, bamboo shoots, and ginger.  They provided dumpling sauce which reeked of vinegar.  Way too much vinegar :(  For dessert, I had the Green Tea Creme Brulee since I'm a huge fan of Green Tea Ice Cream.  This was actually quite delicious.  (Though, I would have preferred Ice Cream)  Also, their beer is expensive.</p><p>I had being negative about the place.  Ramen is one of my favorite foods on earth.  Unfortunately, I feel like they're trying to capitalize on the trendy nature of Japan, and the void of Ramen representation in Madison.  I would rather my money go toward how the food tastes, rather than how the restaurant looks.</p><p>Hopefully, I'll make it back there sometime this weekend to give it another try.  Especially the Tonkotsu Ramen, which looked like it had the correct ingredients, anyway.</p><p>Check out their website for a history of their renovations to 923 Willy St. <br/><a href="http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/" title="http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/" title="http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/">http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/</a><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to I love Ramen!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/i-love-ramen">I love Ramen!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Out of all the foods in the world, Ramen stands as one of my top 5 favorites.  I love the stuff.  It's an entire full meal in itself.  The noodle are the main "meaty" course.  The broth provides an excellent complementary base for the noodles.  And there's little bits of veggies, eggs or meat for variety.</p><p>Though, it wasn't until a year or so into college, when I first stepped into the Asian Market in Minneapolis, that I became such a Ramen freak.  Previously, I had consumed the crappy Maruchan stuff found in grocers.  But when came upon the vast selection of the Asian Market, I was utterly stunned.  An entire aisle, filled both sides full of almost one hundred different kinds of Ramen.  My senses were momentarily overloaded.  I figured they would have more selection and better quality Ramen, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p><p>I did the only logical thing I could think of.  I bought one of every different brand and flavor they had.  The store clerk wasn't very happy when I set a few hand-baskets full of single packs on his counter full Ramen that were all different.  $50 bought me two months worth of food!</p><p>With each and every Ramen pack I made, I wrote down my thoughts on my blog, and scored each one.  It was my quest to figure out which was the best Ramen of them all.  Throughout those 2 months, which was actually closer to 3 or 4 since I didn't eat Ramen every single day, I worked my way through some pretty mediocre products.  You can find most of these reviews in my archives, somewhere around 2003.</p><p>I did eventually find the two best kinds of Instant Ramen ever made..  but I had learned a lot along the way.  What makes the best Ramen?  How does cost factor into the decision?  What sort of things added to the Ramen really bring out the taste?  What else can I do with Ramen outside of the simple instructions?</p><div class='title'><b>Ode to Ramen, collage</b></div><p>For every pack of Ramen I ate, I kept the packaging.  I laid the package on my desk, and placed several books on top to flatten them.  After I completed my task of finding the best Ramen, I created a collage of my journey.</p><p>Though, I guess as an Ode to Finding the best Ramen, it doesn't really work at all.  But it does show the frantic over-sensitized decision I had to originally make when I found myself in the Ramen aisle.  So many choices!  Which one is it?!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp"  /></p><p>By the way, the Answer can be found in the lower left hand side, <b>Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun</b> (which is Korean and may no longer exist), and on the left hand side, <b>Mama's Tomyun Shrimp</b> (which is Thai and can be found at Copps).</p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen</b></div><p>Of course, none of those can compare to actual Ramen in Japan.

I worked all Friday and Saturday grinding away at Modern Algebra and SPAMM upkeep. My brain was fried, so I couldn't concentrate today. There's still so much that needs to be done before school finished in 4 weeks.</p><p>Because I was sick, I decided to eat a bunch of ramen! I'm out of eggs, so I just ate the ramen straight with no fancy additions.</p><p>Today was all about <b>Maruchan Brand Ramen Noodle Soup Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>I cracked open my 6-pack that I purchased for a mere 81 cents. It was the deal of the century! 81 cents for 6! I ate 2 earlier. Later on, I ate a third without even cooking it! I just munched on the noodles, and saved the seasoning for the next meal.</p><p>Man, I don't know why people are so down on Maruchan brand ramen. Of course, it's not the best. But it is not terrible. It's the perfect par in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good flavored soup. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good noodles. And, it doesn't fail at the combination of the two, either.</p><p>I'd say that I ate pretty well today for a net total of 50 cents. What else could you possibly buy for 50 cents? You couldn't buy a Snickers bar. You couldn't buy a bottle of soda. You could buy one of those jumbo gumboils. Or, a hand full of that other crap. But, enough to feed you for a day? No, sir. It also started to heal my illness, too!</p><p>Anywho, despite most people's opinions, I give Chicken Maruchan Ramen a par score of <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. Man, I'm going to buy a few more of these 6 packs before they sell out. I also need eggs, bread, and tuna, and maybe something else to make into fried rice.</p><p>Holy crap! I just noticed that there are recipes on the back to create more interesting dishes. Two of them are standard salads, so who the fuck cares. The other one makes an interesting soup. I should buy some mushrooms and veggies to make this.</p><p>—</p><p>The other day, I had some ramen out of my non-trash stash. I picked out this crazy Korean stuff, <b>Secret Samyang Brand Roasted Chajang Chacharoni Noodles</b>. Secret only because the brand name was hidden on the other side of the package. Hiding something, maybe?</p><p>It was certainly interesting. Everything seemed normal until I added the seasoning into the mix. As I squeezed out the beef stuff, it looked like globs of black ink. It didn't want to come out. When it did, it was heavy and stuck together. After I got most of it out of the pouch, I stirred and blended it into the soup. It turned instantly dark! The noodles absorbed a good amount of the ink, too.</p><p>It tasted pretty good! Though, I'm not sure what was in the other pouch. It could've been cat food for all I know. Little crunchy looking pellets that seemed to disappear once they were added in the soup</p><p>It was quite different than any ramen I've had before. Though, it wasn't all that great. I give Samyang's Roasted Chajang Chacharoni a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Interesting stuff, though there is better. Worth at least one try.</p><p>—</p><p>For my second entree, I wanted something I knew would be crap. I wanted to balance out of the meal with what I just had. I also wanted to save the good stuff, too. I ended up going with <b>5-Minute Express Instant Ramen Noodles Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>These were the cheap Canadian noodles I found at the Dollar store. </p><p>Not a whole lot can be said about this stuff. It also had a solid base with no extra bells or whistles. No veggies or strange soup altering agents. Just simple noodles, and simple soup.</p><p>All in all, I thought it was good. But after my Maruchan Chicken binge earlier today, it pales in comparison to the standards of the United States. I gave 5-Minute Express Chicken Ramen a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Not only does Maruchan taste better, but it's cheaper, too. For the same price, I could get an alternative flavor of Maruchan, rather than Chicken.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to School Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/school-work-and-ramen">School Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All those software projects have backed up since my group and I didn't meet last night. Now, we have to scramble today to catch up. We have a lot of work to do in the next week. I have lots of assignments due tomorrow, too. @_@</p><p>Sigh, but in other news, I had some more ramen this afternoon. Some pretty good stuff, too!</p><p>First off, I had <b>Samyang Brand Sutah Ramen Rich Hot Flavor</b>.</p><p>I saw this package, and I immediately thought, "Holy shit! This is what I'm having today!" Although, I am skeptical now when making Samyang ramen. All their previous ones had turned into sludge, and this is not what I want. Maybe this one would have, too, but I made some corrections. After placing the noodles in the water, I added a little more water. It cooled down the boil, but I let it sit for a few minutes.</p><p>This meal was quite extensive, like the Nong Shim stuff. There was a pouch of soup base, a pouch for the veggies, and another pouch of solid base. I put the solid base in the water first. A little alter, I added the veggies, soup base, and an egg, too.</p><p>This stuff turn out FANTASTIC! Extremely delicious. I was surprised. Although, it makes sense given the quality of packaging and ingredients. It was pretty hot & spicy, but just right for my taste buds. The noodles and seasoning blended perfectly together for the slightly baked taste. Great stuff! I give Sutah Ramen a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Nice job!</p><p>Secondly, I had <b>Nissin Brand Instant Noodles Prawn Flavor</b>.</p><p>Prawn is another specie of Shrimp, by the way. This ramen is also known as the one with the little ramen guy running around on the cover.</p><p>I am a little biased towards Seafood flavored noodles because I LOVE seafood quite a lot. And this stuff totally delivered on the taste. Very seafood-esq. Though, the overall quality of the dish was similar to the cheapness of Maruchan and other American brand noodles. Chucks of crab may have saved this dish, so maybe I'll try that next time.</p><p>Anywho, I give this one a <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. It wasn't bad, but it lacked in overall style and deliciousness.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ramen Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ramen-catchup">Ramen Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I think I fucked up making it or something. They are supposed to be udon noodles, so making them in the microwave is a bit tricky. It takes a lot longer for the noodles to absorb the boiling water and soften. Now, it's no longer a problem for me because I'm using a stovetop. Cooking ramen over heat is the absolute best way to get the best taste out of the instant noodles.</p><p>This stuff was quite good this time. I don't remember how it ended up last time. Probably, the noodles were still hard and tasted funny. Not this time, though. The noodles absorbed the water and seasoning beautifully, and tasted so delicious. The soup was also quite delicious. The perfect blend of spice, veggies, and egg. No ramen sludge. I give Nong Shim's Seafood & Spicy Udon Noodles a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Extremely delicious! And extemely recommended.</p><p>---</p><p>Next up, to counter the Korean excellent, I went with the instant bowled <b>Nissin Brand UFO Yakisoba Oriental Noodle w/ Soup Base</b>.</p><p>Yes, UFO as in Unidentified Flying Object, as spelling out on the cover. I don't get it, but this stuff was certainly NOT out of this world.</p><p>It's not possible to make Yakisoba how it was illustrated on the cover. It can only end up being noodles with yakisoba flavoring. And the yakisoba flavoring tasted like runny meat. It wasn't as bad as that Ichiban Yakisoba, though. This stuff didn't have that crappy taste, and it pulled itself together a little bit. Someone who actually liked yakisoba would proably like it. I give UFO Yakisoba a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I don't think it's possible to make a truly good instant Yakisoba.</p><p>---</p><p>And finally, last week sometime, I made <b>Myojo Brand Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Crab Flavor</b>.</p><p>Speaking of noodles you can't possibly translate into an instant meal, udon noodles will never turn out how they are supposed to. Completely absorbent of their seasoning and meat products soaked in the soup. I tried to boil them longer with the soup base in the broth, but it just doesn't work.</p><p>None the less, this stuff didn't turn out too bad. I find it really odd how well eggs break up in the soup base when making these refrigerated instant meals. It's really weird. Also weird, this stuff tasted nothing like crab. It tasted more like that Chicken flavor in the Maruchan brand ramen. Next time I make this stuff, I certainly must add in that immitation crab they sell at my local grocer. That'll prove to be a delicious meal. But, in the mean time, Myogo Udon Noodles gets a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Better luck next time.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Daily Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/daily-work-and-ramen">Daily Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, it's still early in the week, and I've got plenty of time to do everything. I plan to jet over to Madison tomorrow to do some banking, but I can't stay there for too long. I gotta get back and get stuff done!</p><p>Today for lunch, I filled up with <b>Samyang Brand Sogokimyun Ramen</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" /></p><p>This stuff ended up just like the previous Samyang Ramen...

Not all THAT great, but pretty good. <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>BUT! After that, I had <b>Sapporo Ichiban Brand Kitsune Japanese Style Noodle</b> with Fried Bean Curd & Soup Base.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" /></p><p>This stuff...  I can't began to describe this stuff. It began looking promising. But, the hint of beef in the seasoning prepared me for a runny meat texture. Cooking the stuff wasn't so bad. The noodles were shaped into a square, but not in a manufactured way, like the Maruchan stuff. The noodles were fatter than regular noodles, too. They seemed to be randomly arranged, but broke apart in the boiling water nicely.</p><p>Inside, with the soup base, there was a chunk of fried bean curd. I'm not very judgey when it comes to food, so I threw it all in the dish. I don't konw if it was supposed to break apart in the water, but it did not. It stayed together as one big chunk while it cooked and even after. Actually, looking at the wrapper, maybe I'm supposed to cut it out.  Oops. I put the whole thing in my mouth and took a bite. *BARF* Ugh. I can't desribe how terrible this stuff tasted. I think the closest taste I could compare it to is vomit. At least, that's exactly how my mouth tasted after I spit it into the garbage. Maybe it's better when cut?? DO NOT eat that thing whole.</p><p>Even after that, the ramen did have that runny beef texture I had prepared for. The noodles were really good, though. I give this one a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Sapporo Ichiban has potential, but I don't know why they keep fucking up. There must be an excellent Ichiban Ramen combination out there. This will be my future goal when I return to the Asian market.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM Trip and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-trip-and-ramen">SPAMM Trip and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

We went to the Korean Market, which had a whole aisle of instant noodles! KOREAN instant noodles. The best kind! I bought some bean sprouts and a bunch of ramen for $7.24. The concluded with our dinner at Ginza. I didn't order too much (only $12). It worked out because other folks ordered too much, and I ate their food.</p><p>Then, we returned back to Platteville to the SPAMM house, drank, and played Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.</p><div class='title'><b>Later...</b></div><p>Even though I skimped on food in Madison, I've totally blown my food budget for the month. I mean, I have enough food to last for a while, but I really need to pay attention to how much I spend.</p><p>Anywho, with this in mind, let's eat some ramen! Tonight I began with <b>Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" /></p><p>There were very helpful instructions on the back: <br/>Step 1 - Boil Noodles<br/>Step 2 - Cook in the Soup Base and Veggies<br/>Step 3 - Cook in the Solid Base (and add an egg and whatever else)</p><p>This is now my preferred method of cooking noodles.</p><p>Perhaps the most underrated feature of Nong Shim instant noodles is that noodles come in a circular disk, rather than a square. It breaks apart in the water naturally. AND it actually fits in the pot perfectly. Square noodles have an awkward shape that I need to squish into my pot. Also, square noodles don't really break apart naturally. There are always chunks stuck together, which tear the noodles. Circular noodles stay fit, so you'll have one continuous noodle in the end. ^_^</p><p>Secondly, the veggies from Nong Shim complement the taste of the soup perfectly. So delicious. I added in some bean sprouts and an egg to this ramen, and they soaked up my of the broth's flavor.</p><p>Overall, this stuff was exteremely delicious. I give Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Don't miss this stuff! If you live in Madison, but the 5-pack. I think it was only $3!</p><p>After the delicious stuff, I tried a different brand rather than eating all of my Nong Shim stuff on the first day. I went with <b>Samyang Foods Brand Kimchee Ramen</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" /></p><p>It was rather interesting, much like the preview Ottogi Brand Jin Ramen. I don't know if it's the noodles, the soup base, or the amount of water or heat, but the whole thing came out like sludge. Very heavy. I cooked it the same way as the Nong Shim Brand stuff, but it came out as sludge.</p><p>Ramen sludge isn't all that different than normal ramen. The taste is still there. The noodles stick together a little bit, so it's difficult to pull them apart while you eat.</p><p>It wasn't bad, though. Still better than normal American noodles. Although, it cannot stand up against the Nong Shim excellence. I gave Samyang's Kimchee a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Good effort, mate! Perhaps I should try again and avoid the sludge to experience what you were going.</p><div class='title'><b>Later yet...</b></div><p>I played a lot of DDR Revivial tonight. I was so hungry that I couldn't go to bed, so I made some of the refrigerated udon noodles, <b>Chikara Brand Udon Hot & Spicy Oriental Style Noodes</b>. I bought them a while ago.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" /></p><p>Hot & Spicy is the over statement of the century here. Although, not surprising from an American company.</p><p>These turned out pretty good, but there's got to be a better way to cook them. Udon noodles are supposed to absorb the taste and have a meaty structure. These noodles were very watery with little taste. I don't get it. Although, because of this, the egg breaks up more naturally compared with cooking the dried out instant noodles. Almost like egg drop soup. ^_^</p><p>Overall, I give Chikara's Udon Spicy Noodles a <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>. These noodles never seem to turn out right, and I'm probably not the reason. I will need to experiment further next time.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Underground and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-underground-and-ramen">The Underground and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Sutekh performed a Live PA at the Dinky Towner near the U of M. The Ad said No DJs, and they were very right. The main "headliners" performed a variety of crazy stuff. There was a looping box hooked up to a Megaphone, a hard hooked up to a sampling machine, drums, and, of course, gameboys. </p><p>It was crazy experimental compared to what I normally listen to. Wicked as hell and all over the place. The Dinky Towner was incredibly down to earth compared with the million dollar clubs of downtown Chicago and Minneapolis. Very underground. I recognized a lot of folks from Plush events and the MNVibe boards.</p><p>The whole place was relatively packed, too. I got some pictures, but other people got people ones.
