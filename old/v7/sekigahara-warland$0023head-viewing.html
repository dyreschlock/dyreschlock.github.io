| January 12, 2026 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Toga Valley is an area that cuts through the southwestern mountains of modern day Toyama prefecture. </p><p>The whole region of Toyama is known as Gokayama <span class='ja'>五箇山</span>, which was named from the region being divided into five valleys coming down from the mountains. The five valleys are Akao Valley <span class='ja'>赤尾谷</span>, Kaminashi Valley <span class='ja'>上梨谷</span>, Shimonashi Valley <span class='ja'>下梨谷</span>, Otani Valley <span class='ja'>小谷</span>, and Toga Valley <span class='ja'>利賀谷</span>. I talked about the history of Shimonashi Valley little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">post about Hosoo Pass</a>.</p><p>Four of the five valleys follow the Sho River, which comes from the east side of Mt. Haku going directly north into the Sea of Japan. Toga Valley is different because it follows two different rivers. The Toga River comes from further east to join the Sho River at the base of the mountain. It also follows Momose River, which is further east and never joins either. As such, Toga Valley is almost completely cut out from the other four valleys and is far less populous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the river's edge meets the land, the forests begin. The whole area is over 95% deep forest. But, dotted along the cliffsides were several pocketed settlements back in the day with larger clusters up the mountain forming small villages of Toga, Sakagami, and Momosegawa. In 1896, the gun-district system was established which classified the entire Toga Valley as a single municipality, Higashi Tonami-gun Toga Village <span class='ja'>東礪波郡利賀村</span>. The entirety of Toga Village covered 176 square km.</p><p>As its peak in 1947, the overall population of Toga Village was 4663. (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>) Today, it's around 400. It suffered the fastest rate of population decrease in Toyama prefecture in 2010 (-23% in 5 years), and it is one of the most depopulated areas in Japan. Because of that, there are a lot of abandoned buildings, including entire areas which no longer exist today. Last year (summer 2025), I visited the area 4 times because I was interested in the area's old schools.</p><div class='title'><b>History of Toga Schools</b></div><p>The first school built in Toga Village was <b>Shimo-Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>下利賀尋常小学校</span> in 1892. This was 6 years after the Japanese government's executive order of primary education in Japan <span class='ja'>小学校令</span>, which ultimately stated that all children were required to attend and graduate 4 years of elementary school. With Toga Village established in 1896, the school was renamed to <b>Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀尋常小学校</span>.</p><p>Toga's biggest problem was distance. Toga village began where the <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> branched from <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span>. Toga River travels over 40km up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam, which forms a lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. But, Toga Village also included around 10km along Sho River and the 20km stretch of the <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east to its source.</p><p>Every 2-5 kilometers along the rivers was a small settlement. 2km doesn't seem all that far today, but in 1900, there were no paved roads or cars. (Cars only debuted in Japan in 1898!) People in the mountains traveled by foot (or rarely by horse). It was impossible for young students in the distant settlements to make the daily trip to school. This trip was even more impossible in winter when snow falls and blizzards cut off settlements completely from each other. (Not to mention the dangers of wildlife and insect attacks.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" /></a></p><p>To solve the distance education problem, branch schools <span class='ja'>分校</span> were established. These were schools that branched from the main schools to treat students who lived in areas too far or too inconvenient away. They still operated under the jurisdiction of the main school but had their own branch principal and another teacher or two depending on how many students they had. Teachers couldn't be expected to make the daily trip to school either, so they lived in the school in their own living quarters.</p><p>In 1902, the first branch schools were established in <b>Tochihara</b> <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span>, <b>Kitabara</b> <span class='ja'>北原分校</span>, <b>Sennohara</b> <span class='ja'>仙野原分校</span>, and <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>. These were all areas near the base of the mountain. It wasn't for another 30 to 35 years before more branch schools would open to treat students who lived on the top of the mountain with <b>Mizunashi</b> <span class='ja'>水無分校</span> and <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>大勘場分校</span> branch schools, and another 6 winter branch schools would open for students who lived in between. I don't have all the data, so I think other branch schools opened in this time, too.</p><p>Ultimately, these were some of the most reglected areas in Japan for education. They didn't get money to build enough schools to reach all children. Most teachers also considered being stationed in these branch schools as punishment, too, because they'd be completely cut off from their own families. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After World War II, education was restructured. All students were now required to attend 9 years of school. There was 6 years of elementary and 3 years of junior high schools. As the country rebuilt itself, it identified these remote schools as a problem and implemented the Remote Area Education Promotion Act (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95"><span class='ja'>へき地教育振興法</span></a>). More branch schools would be built in remote areas to obtain a near 100% attendance rate for schools. And, each remote branch school would now be given a grade (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A"><span class='ja'>へき地等級</span></a>). The Remote Grade ranged from 1 to 5 and is determined based on the distance from transportation, hospitals, post offices, and grocery stores. It's also determined by the distance from the main school, city center, and board of education. When a teacher is posted at a branch school, their salary would be increased based on the Remote Grade of the school.</p><p>From the educational restructuring in 1947, <b>Toga Junior High School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀中学校</span> would open in the heart of Toga Village. The graduating class was only 17 students. In 1948, branch schools for the junior high opened in <b>Sakagami</b> <span class='ja'>坂上分校</span> and <b>Momosegawa</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川分校</span>. The graduating class grew to 51 students. In 1949, more branch schools opened in <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>奥大勘場分校</span>, <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>, and <b>Shogawa</b> <span class='ja'>庄川分校</span>. The graduating class was now 92 students. Each of these junior high branch schools just used the existing branch schools, which were still used for elementary school students.</p><p>Population in Japan soured in the 1950s from 83.4 million people in 1950 and 93.2 million in 1960 (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population" title="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population">2</a>). However, Toyama Prefecture remained mostly stagnant going from 1 million people in 1950 to 1.03 million in 1960 (<a href="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015" title="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015">3</a>). And Toga Village had began its sharp decline from 4,663 in 1947 to 3,562 in 1950 to 3,038 in 1960 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). </p><p>Throughout the decade, more branch schools would open to cater to those who couldn't make the journey in winter. By 1959, the number of schools in Toga Village was at its peak. There were 21 total elementary schools (1 main school, 11 branch schools, 9 winter schools) (<a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">4</a>), and the 6 junior highs (1 main, 5 branch). <b>Note:</b> Through Internet researching, I could only find 17 elementary schools.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1962, the dormatory at <b>Toga Junior High School</b> was completed. All distant students now lived at school, which closed all junior high services for branch schools. More and more branch schools continued to close throughout the 60s as infrastructure was built. Roads were paved connecting all the settlements and more people owned cars so they could travel easily. They could also plow snow in winter easier which closed a significant amount of winter branch schools.</p><p>Throughout history, the people in Toga have been pretty poor. The mountains were terrible for growing rice, so most people lived off of growing beans and buying food from selling silk and gunpowder. With the country booming, many families abandoned their old homes to move into cities where they could find decent work and make a much better living. This also closed many branch schools as their neighborhoods were vacated.</p><p>This continued into the 70s. Tunnels were built between the mountains connecting each of the valleys, and expanded motorways were built, too, to make daily travel very easy. In 1970, the population of Toga Village shrank to 1,961, and by 1980, it was 1,328 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). In 1983, the graduating class of Toga Junior High School was only 9 students, the lowest to date. (There were 17 students in the class of 1984, though.)</p><p>By the 1990s, most of the branch schools had either closed or left dormant. In 1996, all remaining branch schools were officially closed and the government sold the buildings to whoever wanted them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1998, the above school was built, the <b>Toga All Persons School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀アーパス</span>. This huge building combined both Toga Elementary and Junior High together in a single building. There was also space for community classes, and had room for foreign students to study abroad from their sister city in Greece. Population of Toga was around 1,000 at this point and all students took the bus to school. Some students had an hour commute.</p><p>In 2004, there were municiple mergers across Japan and Toga Village folded into Nanto City which now covered all of Gokayama and the towns and cities creeping into the urban area of Takaoka. Population was 855 at this point. By 2015, there were only 18 total junior high students, and 16 elementary school students.</p><p>In 2024, both elementary and junior high schools combined into a single school called <b>Nanto City Toga School</b> <span class='ja'>南砺市立利賀学舎</span>. At the time, there were only 10 junior high students (among 3 grades) and 13 elementary students (among 6 grades). The graduating class was only 2 students. There was only one 6th grader and zero 2nd graders. (<a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html">5</a> <a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html">6</a>)</p><p>Only 400 people live in Toga today and they're mostly elderly people. Not many young people live out here and there's really no reason. There's lots of construction, but those companies set up temporary housing for their workers in summer. Very few of those workers actually live in Toga. Historically, the area has been poor so there's not much value in living here.</p><p>Here's a full timeline of these events: <a href="/old/v7/toga-valley-timeline" title="/toga-valley-timeline">/toga-valley-timeline</a></p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley Schools, Settlements, and Neighborhoods</b></div><p>Again, Toga Valley begins where the <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span> and <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> join at the base of the mountain. Toga Village contains the first 10km along the Sho River, but the majority of the village follows Toga River up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam Lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. There's also the initial 20km stretch of <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east that runs mostly parallel with the Toga River.</p><p>In 2025, I went to the area 4 times and visited 14 of the old schools and settlements of Toga Valley. Let's look at each of the areas of Toga Valley in order from the base of the moutain.</p><div class='title'><b>Shogawa <span class='ja'>庄川</span></b></div><p>Shogawa is the first area at the base of the mountain, and its the first cluster of homes visited after leaving the flat lands of Nanto and Tonami. There was a branch school in this neighborhood, but it no longer exists today, and I can't seem to find any traces of it. I'm not sure when it was initially built, but it was probably in the 30s. It was used for Toga Junior High School from 1949 to 1962, and there's photo of it in the Anniversary book.

They also have a yearly Photo Rogaining event!</p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley</b></div><p>Overall, I find the area of Toga Valley fascinating. Its an area that seems like people have always struggled with money, food, and population. Only the areas of Momosegawa seemed fertile enough for large rice production, but there were so many other small pockets along the valley that continued to survive. Again, I'm not really sure why people lived so far up the mountain when there wasn't anything there.</p><p>Most settlements, villages, towns, and cities were built and grew from being on the way to the next big village, town, or city. Or people settled in an area that was abundant in some resource. Maybe the settlers of Toga valley were looking for riches in the mountain, but never found any. Or maybe they just wanted to get away and stay away from the rest of Toyama. Either way, once Japan modernized after World War II, families recognized there was no value and left.</p><p>Looking back at the population chart (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>), Toga Valley had a steady population of around 3000 until its spike and peak in World War II. That spike (4,663 people) is a little misleading as it wasn't natural population growth. During World War II, large Japanese cities were routinely fire bombed by the US, and Toyama City was the most devastated in Japan. The US even used it as practice for Hiroshima and Nagasaki launching 4 "pumpkin bombs" that destroyed 99% of the city on August 1st, 1945.</p><p>Many people moved their families into the mountains to avoid these bombings and this created a population spike in rural Japan. After the war and Japan was rebuilding, there were so many new jobs available in the cities, and neighborhoods were being rebuilt. There was no reason to live in the mountains anymore, and it was probably even sabotage if you stayed.</p><p>Even so, the old guard continues to hold their old homes in the mountain valley with seemingly no real hope for the future. Maybe once the tunnel opens it'll bring more people to Toga, and they could focus on more camping and leisure outdoor activities, like mountaineering and river fishing. I don't think Toga will ever fully go away when Toga Valley's nature looks so great.</p><p>All of the schools and abandoned villages I visited have been collected into singular posts. They were all linked throughout this post, but they have also been collected at this keyword: <a href="/keyword/toga" title="/keyword/toga">keyword/toga</a>. After researching everything, there are a few more new places I want to visit, and double check on a few old ones, so I expect that keyword to grow a little in the future. :)<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (39)
