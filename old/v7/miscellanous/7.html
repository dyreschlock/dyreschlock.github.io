| November 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Happy <a href="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/">Carl Sagan Day</a> everyone!  Today is the first annual celebration of the life of Carl Sagan, the great astronomer, author and philosopher.  75 years ago, he was brought into this world and his inspiration and passion has inspired and affected us all.  Carl Sagan passed away in 1996, but his legacy lives on in those he inspired, especially in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Contact</b></div><p>I think a lot of people's first encounter with Carl Sagan was the movie Contact, at least, for those not actively participating in the field of astronomy or philosophy.  Contact is a film released in 1997 staring Jodie Foster and teen hunk Matthew McConaughey.  It's based on the Science-Fiction novel, written by Carl Sagan.  It was my introduction to his philosophy and interest towards god and extraterrestrial life.  I really liked Contact, but it didn't inspire me to look into the concepts any further.  It was a piece of Science Fiction, and I basically treated it that way.</p><p>I haven't read Contact the novel, but I have the feeling that the story and SciFi aspects prominently displayed in the movie were really just a vehicle to talk about the greater concepts.  The possibility of technological advanced life in our universe, and whether the belief of a higher power is truly representative of our species.</p><div class='title'><b>A Glorious Dawn</b></div><p>It wasn't until recently that I became a big fan on Carl Sagan.  Like usual, it was something on the Internet that inspired and peaked my interest.  2 months ago, on September 17th, 2009, mild mannered John Boswell, released an auto-tuned music video of the Internet composed of quotes and clips from Carl Sagan's award-winning 1980 TV series Cosmos.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zSgiXGELjbc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zSgiXGELjbc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>After listening to A Glorious Dawn, I could not get it out of my head.  It had infected me with its soft low key melody and powerful important message.  I must've listened to this song several hundred times already.  I downloaded the mp3, I downloaded the mpeg video.</p><p>Since the debut of Glorious Dawn on YouTube is has become the #1 highest rated video of all time.  It has become so popular that Boswell started the <b>Symphony of Science</b>, a musical project to bring the thoughts and works of the greatest scientific minds of our lifetime into song and inspire the world to care about Science!</p><p>Additionally, for Carl Sagan Day, A Glorious Dawn will be released as a single through Third Man Records.  Side A will contain A Glorious Dawn, and Side B will contain a reproduction of the contents of the golden record encased in the Voyager space probes launched from earth in the late 70s!  You can get that here: <a href="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html" title="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html" title="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html">Third Man Records</a>.  I ordered my copy. ^_^</p><p>Also, additionally, Symphony of Science has released a second song, "We are all Connected", featuring Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye. ^_^</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XGK84Poeynk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XGK84Poeynk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>All songs and videos are available on the Symphony of Science website at <a href="http://www.symphonyofscience.com/" title="http://www.symphonyofscience.com/" title="http://www.symphonyofscience.com/">http://www.symphonyofscience.com/</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Cosmos</b></div><p>I was an immediate fan of Boswell, but he was really just the messenger.  The real beauty of Glorious Dawn was Carl Sagan and the thoughts behind all the concepts mentioned in the song.</p><p><em>"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</em></p><p><em>"The sky calls to us.  If we do not destory ourselves, we'll one day venture to the stars."</em></p><p><em>"The Cosmos is full behind measure of elegant truths of the exquisite interrelationships of the awesome machinery of nature."</em></p><p><em>"The simplest thought like the concept of the number one has an elaborate logical underpinning."</em></p><p>Carl Sagan has an extraordinary talent of talking about incredibly large and complex topics in a very straight forward, direct, easy-to-understand manor.  It just so happens that entire series of Cosmos is available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos" title="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos" title="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos">Hulu</a>.  Over the course of a week or two, I watched the entire show, while playing Katamari Forever.</p><p>Cosmos was originally made in 1980.  All these episodes are the 1990 versions with updates included at the end of the episodes to talk about the advancements made in those 10 years relative the subject manor in each episode.</p><p>In many ways, Cosmos is Carl Sagan's message to us.  It's a message of fact explaining the universe and how it personally relates to us.  It's a message of passion demonstrating the magnitude of who and what we are.  It's a message of imagination challenging your mind to expand itself beyond your limitations.  And it's a message of love, so to speak, pleading with the world to end needless war.</p><p>It's an amazing 13 episode journey that is a display of earth's greatest scientific achievements.  Even though, it's almost 30 years old, the passionate, powerful message is timeless.. We are all one species..  We have evolved because of our nack of exploration, curiosity, imagination, and togetherness.  We must embrace each other and embark on the next journey of discovery.. to the stars.</p><p>If you haven't seen Cosmos, definitely check it out.  It's entirely online for free! ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Happy Carl Sagan Day!</b></div><p>Have a great day everyone!  Though, I'm somewhat confused as to which actual day Carl Sagan day is supposed to be.  <a href="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/">Carl Sagan Day dot Com</a> says it's supposed to be today on November 7th, the anniversary of his birth.  However, Wikipedia says his birthday is on the 9th.  That's also when the Glorious Dawn single is released..  Who knows..  Happy Carl Sagan weekend?<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shipping Action Figures on eBay" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shipping-action-figures-on-ebay">Shipping Action Figures on eBay</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I bought an eBay store, and started listing VHS tapes, DVDs, Video Games, Music, Action Figures, and other things on Half.com and eBay.  Throughout the following months, it was incredibly successful.  There were weeks when I'd have as much as 5 packages to send out each day.  Things eventually died down, but there have been <a href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-restock" title="/schlock-for-sale-restock" title="/schlock-for-sale-restock">restock days</a> every now and then.</p><p>Action figures have been the most annoying items to send because there really isn't a standard issue box to accomodate the variety of dimensions.  Some are taller, some are fatter, some are heavy, some are fragile.  Eventually, I came across a pretty effecient way to box them, and I'd like to share that with you.</p><div class='title'><b>How I box an action figure</b></div><p>For every action figure I sell, I create a completely custom box to ship it in.  In order to create a box from nothing, I needed some cardboard.  Cardboard is VERY easy to come by if you live in an apartment building that frequenty changes residents.  One day I found two HUGE U-haul boxes in the recycling bin, which have served me incredibly well.  I dragged those back to my apartment and stuffed them in our extra closet.  I've found some more boxes over the months, so they've begun to pile up...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Cutting</b></div><p>With the largest chunk of cardboard, I begin measuring the dimensions of the action figure on the box.  Though, usually, I just begin cutting with a box cutter.  The dimensions don't have to be exact because cardboard bends and shape very easily.  It's a great medium for builing sculptures. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp"  /></p><p>There's one piece cut.

It was pretty decent, though it wasn't gourmet by any means.  It tasted identical to the sushi you can find at Copps, actually.  They had plenty of sushi chefs on staff preparing it and putting it out immediately.  But again, the quality is nothing compared to what you'll find at Takumi or Sushi Muramoto.</p><p>They had plenty of Japanese beers, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp"  /></p><p>Their buffet was the only food item on the menu, and for a $20 entry fee, the price is a little steep.  If you're going to dine for Japanese tonight, I would definitely recommend any other Japanese restaurant in Madison.  Takumi and Sushi Muramoto are absolutely delicious for Sushi, and Ginza and Takara are fantastic too with a more well-rounded menu.</p><p>I don't want to bash on the place because I love Japanese food and it's great to see a new restaurant open that isn't just Sushi or Teppanyaki and has more variety, but...  you can do better.</p><p>I really wish a Ramen restaurant would open in Madison or somewhere nearby.  The closest and only one I know of is in Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights, Chicago.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to I love Ramen!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/i-love-ramen">I love Ramen!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Out of all the foods in the world, Ramen stands as one of my top 5 favorites.  I love the stuff.  It's an entire full meal in itself.  The noodle are the main "meaty" course.  The broth provides an excellent complementary base for the noodles.  And there's little bits of veggies, eggs or meat for variety.</p><p>Though, it wasn't until a year or so into college, when I first stepped into the Asian Market in Minneapolis, that I became such a Ramen freak.  Previously, I had consumed the crappy Maruchan stuff found in grocers.  But when came upon the vast selection of the Asian Market, I was utterly stunned.  An entire aisle, filled both sides full of almost one hundred different kinds of Ramen.  My senses were momentarily overloaded.  I figured they would have more selection and better quality Ramen, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p><p>I did the only logical thing I could think of.  I bought one of every different brand and flavor they had.  The store clerk wasn't very happy when I set a few hand-baskets full of single packs on his counter full Ramen that were all different.  $50 bought me two months worth of food!</p><p>With each and every Ramen pack I made, I wrote down my thoughts on my blog, and scored each one.  It was my quest to figure out which was the best Ramen of them all.  Throughout those 2 months, which was actually closer to 3 or 4 since I didn't eat Ramen every single day, I worked my way through some pretty mediocre products.  You can find most of these reviews in my archives, somewhere around 2003.</p><p>I did eventually find the two best kinds of Instant Ramen ever made..  but I had learned a lot along the way.  What makes the best Ramen?  How does cost factor into the decision?  What sort of things added to the Ramen really bring out the taste?  What else can I do with Ramen outside of the simple instructions?</p><div class='title'><b>Ode to Ramen, collage</b></div><p>For every pack of Ramen I ate, I kept the packaging.  I laid the package on my desk, and placed several books on top to flatten them.  After I completed my task of finding the best Ramen, I created a collage of my journey.</p><p>Though, I guess as an Ode to Finding the best Ramen, it doesn't really work at all.  But it does show the frantic over-sensitized decision I had to originally make when I found myself in the Ramen aisle.  So many choices!  Which one is it?!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp"  /></p><p>By the way, the Answer can be found in the lower left hand side, <b>Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun</b> (which is Korean and may no longer exist), and on the left hand side, <b>Mama's Tomyun Shrimp</b> (which is Thai and can be found at Copps).</p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen</b></div><p>Of course, none of those can compare to actual Ramen in Japan.  And especially Hakata Ramen found on the streets of Fukuoka, Japan after night fall.  I ate a shit load of Ramen with studying abroad in Nagasaki, Japan.  Some from franchises, some from street vendors, and even some new Instant flavors I hadn't tried before.</p><p>When deciding on a topic for my "final" history project, I lept at the chance to cover Ramen.  And I did so in the form of verse.  Thanks to links on Wikipedia and general Google searching, finding enough information to form a timeline was pretty easy.  Though, I still ended up at the local Internet Cafe quite late, trying to pull everything together.</p><p>I wrote my script, and rocked the microphone hard!!  Here ya go!</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing"><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen - 5 min 42 sec</b></a></p><p>If I knew piano, I would probably re-record this lovable "poem" with a nice beat.

I finished around the same time as previously, but just a little bit quicker.  In the Madison Half Marathon, I finished at 2 hours 50 minutes, but it was probably closer to <b>2 hours 48 minutes</b>, as it took 2 minutes to cross the starting line.  I finished the Madison Mini Marathon is <b>2 hours 45 minutes</b>.  And today, I finished the Fox Cities Marathon is <b>2 hours 43 minutes</b>.</p><p>After finishing my first Half Marathon, I wrote about why I <a href="/old/v7/run-run-run" title="/run-run-run" title="/run-run-run">decided to Run</a>. Spoiler! I saw the movie, Run Fatboy Run, and thought it looked pretty easy.  And it wasn't too difficult.  That first half marathon beat the shit out of me, but it gave me perspective and motivation for fitness.</p><div class='title'><b>Motivation</b></div><p>Motivation is the reason I signed up for another 2 Half Marathon right after finishing the first.  Motivation to continue running on my own and exercise regularly.  Overall, I run to lose weight and keep fit.  I like to be light on my feet.  But running builds Motivation of its own.  The energy spent and built while running keeps the body in motion throughout the day.  It eases my lazy tendencies and lightens my mood.  The cycle of exercise and motivation to exercise is just as powerful as the cycle to sit there and not exercise.</p><p>During a marathon, that motivation is far greater because you're surrounded by thousands of other people that have the motivation to get out of bed on very early weekend morning and run for a few hours as the sunrises.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" /></p><p>Everyone is there for different reasons, but those reasons give them the same motivation that guides their feat across the pavement and eventually across the finish line.  And at the finish line you're given a medal for you hard work.  There are few exercises that will award with a medal on top of the health, fitness and perpetual motivation.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>The daylight continues to escape the skies, the leaves have started to wither and rot, and the temperature is declining.  Fall is here and my weekends are rather busy, so I don't have the time to take in any more half marathons this year.  Though, I will probably do Gilda's Run on October 24th in Middleton, which is 5 miles.</p><p>I've been looking at Half Marathon dates next year and have a couple that look like fun.</p><p>Feb 28th // Gasparilla Half Marathon in Tampa, Florida<br/>May 1st // Door County Half Marathon in Pennisula Park, Wisconsin<br/>May 1st // Wisconsin Half Marathon is Kenosha, Wisconsin (one or the other, not both)<br/>May 30th // Madison Half Marathon in Madison, Wisconsin<br/>Jun 6th // Minneapolis Half Marathon in Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>Hopefully, that Florida Half Marathon will keep me running over the next 5 months.  I started "training" back in March this year, so the cold shouldn't keep me away.  Though, huge gaping breaths in cold tempatures could probably screw up my throat.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Healthcare March on Capitol Square" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/healthcare-march-on-capitol-square">Healthcare March on Capitol Square</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They carry clothes, toys, movies and, of course, video games.  In fact, the PX is a gold mine for video games.  The PX has many games that time forgot.  And since the general populous cannot shop at the PX, it keeps the riff-raff out and the supply high.</p><p>What's really weird is the huge surplus of games published by Atlus.  Atlus is a North American publisher that spends a lot of time and attention on presentation and limited edition releases of their games.  They generally publish a lot of RPGs, including their own super-popular RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei.  SMT has been getting a lot of buzz over here thanks to Persona.</p><p>This <b>surplus</b> includes recent releases, such as Dark Spire, Knights of the Nightmare, Devil Summoner 2, Hammerin' Hero,

especially Digital Devil Saga 2.  I would buy every single one of these games, except the PX sells them for MSRP.  Every PS2 game is $50, every PSP game $40, and every NDS game $35.  It's a treasure trove, but at a cost!</p><p>So that's probably why they still have so many copies of these games.  Why buy a $50 PS2 game that full of pussy Japanese bullshit, when I can buy a badass FPS for the Xbox 360 for only $10 more?!  Riddle me that, civilian!</p><p>Anyways, as you can see in these pictures, they don't have just a few copies of these games in stock.  They have a whole bunch of copies.  And it's not just this PX too.  When Justin was stationed in North Carolina, I picked up copies of Devil Summoner 1 and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne.  Both of which are Atlus published (and developed) games.</p><p>I find it really odd that these military posts have such a huge surplus of these games.  And!  That no one on-base buys any of them.  You'd think the rules of Supply and Demand would be enforced here, but they aren't.  The next time I return to Florida to visit Justin, there will be just as many Atlus games as there were on this trip.  It's really odd.</p><p>They need to put all their Atlus titles on sale or clearance or something.  Hopefully when they do, it'll be the same weekend I'm down there.  My half.com store will have a glut of fantastic games, again!</p><div class='title'><b>Not just Atlus</b></div><p>Atlus is the most prominently published games, but there are plenty of other unappreciated titles on those shelves.</p><p>There were copies of Okami, God Hand, Soul Nomad, and Rhapsody.  There were copies of other NIS games, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp"  /></p><p>If you happen to know someone in our Armed Forces, visit them and take a look at the video game stock at their PX.

Also, the local Best Buy had some sweet deals on poorly selling games, so I bought a copy of Eat Lead: Matt Hazard for $15.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock for Sale Restock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-restock">Schlock for Sale Restock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He had a whole lot of unfinished series.  Mostly the first two or three volumes.  Rather than spend the extra money to complete series that he probably wasn't going to watch anyways, he handed them over to me.</p><p>And here they are..

I still have stuff to sell, but almost all of the big stuff has been sold.

| June 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On Friday morning last week, I got up bright and early, like I do every day.  Except today was different.  I took the day off work.  Instead of waiting for the bus in front of my apartment building, I went down the block and got on a different bus.  One that took me over to my local At&amp;t where, 11 days prior, I had paid for my new cell phone!</p><p>My new cell phone is the fancy iPhone 3GS, which At&amp;t had opened its doors early for.  I was 5th in line when I arrived and 40 minutes later, I walked out of the door with my new phone.</p><div class='title'><b>My previous phone</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp"  /></p><p>For the last 2 1/2 years, I've been using the 8525.  After careful research and comparisons which I blogged about here (<a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars">Jan 23rd, 2007</a>) and here (<a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars-part-2" title="/cellular-wars-part-2" title="/cellular-wars-part-2">Feb 5th, 2007</a>), I bought this phone because it could do Japanese and was compatible with Japan's cellular signals.</p><p>This was the first cellphone and cellphone contract I've ever done!  I was excited and had a lot of fun with it...  at first.  But as time went on, the 8525 degraded and felt apart like a cheap pencil.  These days, I can't hold a conversation longer than 1.5 hours without the fully charged battery dying.  Windows Mobile 5 crashes all the damn time.  And it is very slow when doing the simplest of Internet tasks.</p><p>Ever since my contract had run its 2 year course, I could not wait to get rid of that piece of shit.  We had some good times, but some things in life just aren't meant to last.  We all knew that the 3rd generation iPhone was coming out sometime this Summer.  So, I was patient.  I needed only to wait.  And 2 weeks ago, Apple finally announced that it would coming the Friday after next.</p><div class='title'><b>iPhone 3GS</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp"  /></p><p>Friday finally arrived, and with it brought my iPhone.  That general fancy-gadget excitement had returned!  I felt just as anxious and optimistic when I first got my 8525.  Not only do I have a fancy new phone, but I actually have an iPod now.  All these years, I've still been buying and using CDs like a caveman.  In fact, the reason I've been slacking off on blogging again was because I spent last week ripping all my CDs and importing them in iTunes.  I was preparing!</p><p>After my first 5 days with this thing, I love it.  It blows my previous phone out of the water and does so much more.  Much like when I first got the 8525, I feel like I'm carrying around a little personal computer.  Most everything I do on the Internet, can be done on the iPhone.  So if I'm away for the weekend, I can easily keep up with News or whatever without clunking around my laptop.</p><p>The iPhone isn't the only fancy phone on the market these days.  Palm released its <b>Palm Pre</b> about a month ago.  The Palm Pre is a little amazing piece of technology of its own.  It's every bit good as the iPhone...  except there is one thing that the Palm Pre <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely</span> does not have.</p><div class='title'><b>Video games</b></div><p>Thanks to the overwhelming market share, the iPhone has started becoming a contender in the game market.  Game Developers are actually starting to take it seriously, to an extent.  The larger developer studios mostly see it as a quick way to make some money, like with <b>Metal Gear Solid Touch</b> and <b>I Love Katamari</b>.</p><p>But some PC studios have released their full fledged games on the iPhone, like Gameloft with <b>Oregon Trail</b> and Popcap Games with <b>Peggle</b> and a few others.</p><p>Not only that, but in the next few months, we'll see the release of the <b>Dexter</b> iPhone game.  Which will be the first "high" budget, full-fledged released iPhone game.  In the game, you carefully stalk your victims, building a case as to why they should killed.  You justify their murders, kidnap them, and justify your decision to their face.  If you correctly uphold the law of Harry, and don't get caught or let your guard down, you win.</p><p>The Dexter iPhone game had an impressive showing at E3 where many journalists compared it to the Phoenix Wright series on the DS.  That should come out in July.</p><p>But anyways, I've been having a great time with the games I have so far.
