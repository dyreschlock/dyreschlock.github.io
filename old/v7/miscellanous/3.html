| August 26, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of last semester, I had an extra class for some of my 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> classes at one of my schools.  I didn't want them to get too far ahead of the other schools, so I wanted to do some kind of game that took up the entire class period.  One of the other ALTs mentioned this particular game, so I stole his idea.</p><p>The idea was making a puzzle out of the contiguous United States, and coloring the states in such a way that you could talk about Time Zones after, as well as any other state facts you may want to teach or talk about.  I've had the students guess which state I'm from.  Also, they could guess where some popular states or cities might be on the map.  Those kind of things.</p><p>Here's what it looks like:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0161.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0161.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0161.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0162.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0162.webp" /></p><p>The pieces turned out really well.  It works best if you have a blackboard or whiteboard to magnetically attach the pieces to.  On the ground, the pieces just move around too much to form a tight cohesive picture.</p><p>For my class, I made 4 sets of these puzzles, which took me a total of, like, 15 hours, or something like that.  It took a long ass time.</p><div class='title'><b>Making the Files</b></div><p>Below, I have attached the files, so you can print out and create your own puzzle. :)  The states are separated on to 9 separate A3 print outs, and an outlined map of the states is included, too.  That's A4, though.</p><p>After the first week of working as a teacher in Japan, I downloaded a vector image of the United States to introduce myself to the students.  I used that vector image to create these print outs.  </p><p>I sized the image so that Texas and California would fit within the space of A4 paper.  With that in mind, all the states fit within 9 separate A3 printouts.</p><p>Also, all the states are colored to (mostly) reflect the 4 time zones in the contiguous U.S., and no adjoining states have the same color, which is a good hint to give the students when they're putting together the puzzle.</p><div class='title'><b>Making the Puzzle</b></div><p>Again, feel free to download my files, and follow the next couple of steps to make your own copy of the puzzle.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Print</b></div><p>First, Print out all the pieces using a color printer.  Be sure to set the paper output to A3.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0151.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2. Laminate</b></div><p>Next, you need to laminate each of the pieces.  Every school should have a laminator, and A3 sized laminator film.  I guess you should ask if you can use these things, but they are available for you, or any teacher, to use to create your materials.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0148.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0148.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0149.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0149.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0149.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0152.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0152.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0152.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0155.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0155.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0155.webp" /></p><p>This probably takes about 35 or 40 minutes to do depending on how fast your printer prints, and how fast your laminator laminates.  For my 4 sets, I think it took around 2 1/2 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>3. Cut them out</b></div><p>Find some really nice, stiff, strong scissors, and cut along the edges of each of the states.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0156.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0156.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0156.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0157.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0157.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0157.webp" /></p><p>The western states are the most easiest because they are large, and mostly rectangular.  The eastern states are tiny, numerous, and have a lot of goofy edges that can take a while to clip if you're being precise about the shape of the state.</p><p>Some eastern states are so small that I kept several of them together.  Like the following:</p><p>- Vermont and New Hampshire I left as a single piece.<br/>- Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut are also a single piece.<br/>- New York and New Jersey are a single piece.<br/>and<br/>- Maryland, D.C., Delaware, and the eastern end of Virginia are also a single piece.</p><p>All other states are fine as single pieces.</p><p>This is the most time consuming part of the process.  I think it took me about 1 1/2 hours, or 2 hours, to cut out each of the state for a single set.  I don't actually remember how long it took me to cut out all these pieces, but I do remember for all 4 of my sets it took longer than the length of 3 movies.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Magnets</b></div><p>Lastly, attach magnets to each of the pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0159.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0159.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140716_puzzle/IMG_0159.webp" /></p><p>The schools won't provide any magnets to attach to your pieces (or any other materials), so you need to buy those yourself.  The 100<span class='ja'>円</span> shops carry magnets that work pretty well.  For a mere 108<span class='ja'>円</span>, you can get a pack of 250 pinky-sized magnets.</p><p>This doesn't take very long to do.</p><div class='title'><b>Viola</b></div><p>All done.</p><p>Again, I used this in my 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> classes at one of my schools.  I wanted it to take the entire class period, so I didn't give them a map to view from.  Thinking back on that now, it was incredibly unfair of me to do that.  If you were given any puzzle, you need a full image to figure out how to build it.  I still drew the outline and some of the states on the backboard for them, and helped them out building the puzzle.  But they needed an image to build from.</p><p>So, for the 5<span class='ja'>年生</span>, it took them the whole class period, or 40 minutes to build the puzzle.</p><p>Over the summer, we had an English summer camp for the junior high students, and I used this game again.  This time, I had a cover image for the students to build from, so they immediately figured out where to start and how to build it.</p><p>For the junior high school student, each group of 5 students took about 10 minutes to build it, without any help.</p><div class='title'><b>Comments</b></div><p>Anyway, it's not a bad activity.  </p><p>It does teach culture and geography rather than English, though.  And following that model, I think it would really help if I had a scale-sized image of Japan to compare so the students could conceptualize just how big the U.S. is compared with Japan.</p><p>Also, if you have some classes with around 40 students, 4 copies of the puzzle won't be enough.  I think it works best when the group size is small.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hida Speech Contest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hida-speech-contest">Hida Speech Contest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 25, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>During summer vacation in Japan, all junior high school students rigorously practice to compete in the tournaments for their club activities.  </p><p>These tournaments are incredibly important because every student in every city in every prefecture in Japan are competing in similar tournaments.  And the winners advance to the larger tournaments until the final tournament near Tokyo, which includes all the best teams from throughout Japan.</p><p>These tournaments are also important because during or after summer vacation, the 3<span class='ja'>年生</span> retire from their club activities.  They must focus on getting into high school, and can no longer compete in tournaments or games.</p><p>There's an English speech contest that follows this same trend, and for my students it begins in the region of <b>Hida</b> on <b>Tuesday, August 21st</b>.  The winners proceed to the Gifu English Speech Contest in September, and those winners continue to Tokyo for the All Japan Contest, which is in October or November, or some time.</p><div class='title'><b>Participation</b></div><p>2 weeks after the <a href="http://localhost:8084/takayama-speech-contest" title="http://localhost:8084/takayama-speech-contest">Takayama Speech Contest</a>, we received the email containing all the information about the Hida contest.  All schools had identical participation limits, unlike the Takayama contest.  Each school could submit a maximum of 6 students to the contest.  Much like the Takayama contest, I was determined to get the maximum amount of students to participate.</p><p>Kiyomi Junior High only has 71 students, and I've gotten to know the English level of my students pretty well.  The 3<span class='ja'>年生</span> and 2<span class='ja'>年生</span> students were easy to choose, but I still didn't know who to choose for 1<span class='ja'>年生</span>, and I've been thinking about it ever since the Takayama contest.  I had some idea, but this was the same week as our first term exam in school.  Those tests results help me confirm and add a few additional students to my "radar".</p><p>With only 6 spots open, I asked 5 3<span class='ja'>年生</span> students, 4 2<span class='ja'>年生</span> students, and 4 1<span class='ja'>年生</span> students.  I asked all of them on June 20th, and wanted them to reply to me back June 27th.</p><p>The 3<span class='ja'>年生</span> students were the same ones I asked for the Takayama contest.  Having already done the contest, they really didn't want to do another one.  3 of the 2<span class='ja'>年生</span> confidently replied, "Yes," so that made me happy.  The other student also did the Takayama contest, and also didn't want to do it again.  All 4 of the 1<span class='ja'>年生</span> confidently said, "Yes," too, which was really surprising.  They're so shy in class, and never speak to me in English.  Unfortunately, the limit was 6, so one of the 1<span class='ja'>年生</span> had to back down.</p><p>But, I now had my 6 participates.</p><div class='title'><b>Deadline</b></div><p>The deadline to sign up for the contest was July 18th, which included a copy of their speech written in English and Japanese, side-by-side on a single A4 piece of paper.  The students had 3 weeks to get their speeches finished, and translated into English, and ready to go.</p><p>It's kind of short.</p><div class='title'><b>Speech Writing</b></div><p>I gave the students a week to write their speeches with a July 4th deadline.  I gave them instructions on how they should write their speeches, and I have them some sample topics, too.</p><p>I think the best speeches are ones that have a clear beginning, middle, and end.  Ones that focus on some kind of personal conflict or tragedy in their life, how their lives changes because of the conflict, and what they learned from it, or how they overcame it to become a better person.</p><p>Good speeches also include tons of examples, and stories that explain the topic they're presenting.  Or, the speech could simply be an entire story, with the writer explaining it in an interesting way, and talking about their thoughts on the story as its being told.</p><p>For another level above this, it would be really good if the students thought about their own emotions, and express those within the writing, so they could bring out those emotions during their speech.</p><div class='title'><b>Speech Editing</b></div><p>I received most of the student's speeches, and started translating them into English.  One of the speeches was perfect, and didn't need any further edits.  It was a little long, but was possible to read in 4 minutes.  The other speeches all had some problems.  Most of the speeches simply lacked examples, or personal thoughts.  Another student's was way too damn short.</p><p>I added my notes to their Japanese speeches.  I asked specific questions to the students, so they could add more sentences with the kind of content that would make a better speech.</p><p>After the second round of editing, 2 more students' speeches were compete, but the other 3 were not good.</p><p>One was still too short.  His speech was about an interesting math problem, but it took less than 2 minutes to read.  I had him add a second math problem to his speech, so it would be the correct length.  It turned out pretty good after that.</p><p>The other two speeches had no purpose.  One of them had a clear topic, but they both just talked about stuff, and then ended.  It was just information, and even with some personal thoughts, nothing really connected together.  The English teacher and I talked to them again about the structure of a speech, and there should be a clear beginning, middle and end.</p><p>I got their finished speeches the day of the deadline, and they were good enough.</p><div class='title'><b>Actual Deadline</b></div><p>Actually, what I thought was the original deadline for the speeches, July 18th, was only for the entry.  The actual speeches weren't due until August 1st.  So, we had some more time to talk with the students, and fix their speeches.  </p><p>But it was much more difficult to talk with the students during summer, since they came to school so infrequently.  We did finally finish those last two speeches.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>Much like the Takayama contest, I solely went through each of the student's speeches, translated them to English, and wrote a speech based on the translation.  It's a lot of work.  So much so, that when the English teacher tried to do it, he said it was too difficult for him.</p><p>I can understand most of the grammar used in these speeches.  I just can't understand most of the Kanji used, nor their meaning, nor some of the meaning of hiragana words.  For each speech, I had a running vocabulary list.  Once that list was complete, I put together the sentences.  I also used Google Translate to double check some mistakes.  Then the English teacher checked my translation.</p><p>After that, I wrote out the English speech.  And went over the speech again to remove any dialect or accent differences, and also replaced some difficult words with simple English.  I made sure to use grammar and vocabulary the students should know, too.</p><p>I didn't have many problems with the translation, but there were a few sentences that I absolutely could not understand, and it took the English teacher and I about 30 minutes, or an hour to figure out a correct translation.</p><div class='title'><b>For Example…</b></div><p>For example, this sentence:<br/><span class='ja'>中身のブランデーの値段は空きビンより</span>$40<span class='ja'>高いわけだから</span><br/><i>Contents of Brandy of Price <span class='ja'>は</span> empty bottle more than $40 expensive reason because of</i></p><p>I could not understand the grammar behind <span class='ja'>空きビンより</span>$40<span class='ja'>高い</span>.  <span class='ja'>より</span> is comparative, so whatever is ____<span class='ja'>より</span> is being compared to the subject.  So, <span class='ja'>中身のブランデーの値段</span> The price of the contents of the Brandy, is <span class='ja'>より</span> more <span class='ja'>高い</span> expensive than <span class='ja'>空きビン</span> the empty bottle.</p><p>But how does $40 factor into this?  The rest of the text implies that it's written in a confusing way, and the preceding math problem doesn't make sense if the Brandy is $40.</p><p>Ultimately, after thinking about it for a little while, I figured it out, and the following translation fit everything perfectly:<br/><i>The price of the contents of the Brandy is more than $40 <u>and</u> the price of the empty bottle.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Speech Practice Materials</b></div><p>Anyway, all the speeches had been translated and written, and now the students had to begin memorizing, and learning how to perform their speeches effectively.  3 speeches were complete before the end of the semester, July 18th.  Another was finished that weekend, July 21st.  And the other two were finished on August 1st.</p><p>For each of the students, I created a study guide and CD to help them practice pronunciation, and memorization.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0142.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0142.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0142.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0143.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0143.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0143.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0146.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0146.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_0146.webp" /></p><p>Each student got an English copy of their speech in large 12 point font.  They also got a copy of their entry form, which had the English and Japanese version of their speech.</p><p>Also, I had each student read through their speech one time, and I made notes about each word that was difficult for them to read.  I create a vocabulary list which had each word.</p><p>Then for the CD, the first track was a straight reading of the speech.  For the second track, I read each sentence, then gave time for the student to repeat the sentence.  Then the remaining tracks contained the vocabulary list, and pauses for the students to repeat.</p><p>In addition, I gave them a sheet of paper with study points.  For memorization, I gave them a road map on how they could memorize their speech.  Once they could complete a number, they could cross it off, and go to the next.</p><p>Each student said they practiced with the CD, and said it was helpful, only one of my students actually memorized their speech completely.  I don't think they actually used the CD as much as they should have.  I think I should have made an easier ladder for them to climb.</p><div class='title'><b>Summer Vacation Practice Schedule</b></div><p>I think it also would've been more helpful, if I create a more structure and solid summer schedule before the end of the school year, rather than a week after the speech deadline.</p><p>I met with my students only once a week during summer.  They absolutely made progress over this time, but I think they should've practiced more often on their own.  Meeting more times over the summer could have given them more motivation to practice.</p><p>But, I dunno.  I don't know the student's personal schedule, or if they're able to practice at home.  A simple hour each day would easily be enough, but maybe they didn't have an hour.</p><p>I gave them until August 9th to memorize their speech, but no one made that deadline.  Later, only one student would actually have their entire speech memorized for the contest.</p><div class='title'><b>Practice</b></div><p>During our practice over summer, I gave the students a copy of the judging criteria, and I went over what each student needed to do to improve and achieve the goals listed on the sheet.</p><p>Most students needed a louder voice, so we practiced in the hallway at school with a very large distance between us.  Other students needed to smile, so I kept reminding them to smile during practice.  We practiced rhythm, and volume control.  Since most students didn't memorize their speech, I tried to train them to read from their speech, but maintain eye contact with the audience, so it still appeared natural.</p><div class='title'><b>Competition</b></div><p>The day finally came, and my students were very nervous.  They were all split up into different groups, and had to compete against 11 or 12 other students in each group.  The best 3 from each group would continue to the finals in the afternoon.  The top 7 students from the finals would continue to the Gifu tournament in September.</p><p>Each group had 2 judges, and each judge was an ALT, so I was unable to run around to see all my students perform their speeches.  And I wasn't able to take photos, either.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of my students did well enough to make it to the finals.  They were really nervous, and did not practice enough on their own to deliver their speeches effectively.  I understand it takes an incredible amount of work to memorize and effectively perform your speech, but all that work makes the experience less nerve wrecking, and dreadful.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3665.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3665.webp" /></p><p>The judging came and went, and none of my students made the cut.  The finals were pretty good.  There were absolutely some clear winners with some great speeches.  Others were pretty entertaining, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>Even though, they didn't win, that really wasn't the point for any of these students.  I asked each student for their goal, and each student responded with wanting to improve their English skills.  In that way, I think each of them accomplished their goal.  With the exception of one student, every student had amazing pronunciation.  They can say their Rs, and Ls, THs, Ss, and other difficult to pronounce English just fine. :)</p><p>I think for each of the student's English class will be much easier going forward.  (Of course, they already are A students in class.)</p><p>For each of the students, the English teacher and I made a print to display outside of the English classroom.  Each print contains the English and Japanese version of the students' speeches, their names and event, a photo of them during their speech, and some comments made by the English teacher, who was able to listen to each speech.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3965.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3966.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140821_speech/IMG_3966.webp" /></p><p>For the time being, they'll be displayed downstairs, so when the school has its Sports Festival, all the parents can take a look at the speeches, and be proud of their kids. :)</p><p>Again, they didn't do well in the competition, but I think they still gained some valuable experience for the future.  I think they'll do way better next year if I'm able to convince them to compete, again.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon 2014" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2">Takaoka Marathon 2014</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 18, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I attended the Takaoka Half Marathon for the second time.  Last year, the race was in November, and it was a much cooler day.  I wrote about that here: <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">November 18th</a>.  </p><p>Last year, although, I trained and was in alright shape, the time limits set by the race prevented me from finishing.  I made it to the 17.3km gate at 1 minute too late.  So, I definitely planned on signing up again and vowing to complete the marathon!</p><div class='title'><b>This Year</b></div><p>Well, I did not train nearly as much as I did last year.  Last year, there were other people I signed up with, and we trained a few times together, and had some fun.  We were a team.  This year, it was just me.  And I had been so busy and tired with school that I barely trained at all.  I am still doing Kendo, but even then, I still occasionally miss Kendo practice due to the amount work needed to teach at my schools.</p><p>So, I was not nearly in the shape I was last year.  I was totally prepared for not finishing.  In fact, my time probably would've been better spent had I simply skipped the event.  But whatever…  I'll still drive down there, and make it as far as I can.</p><div class='title'><b>The Race</b></div><p>This year's course was identical to last year's.  Of course, this year it was in June, rather than November.  The morning wasn't too bad.  There was a nice breeze, and the clouds prevented the sun from heating everyone up.</p><p>At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony, where the Takaoka athletic association said some words, and last year's winners came up to the front and said their words, too.  Blah blah blah, I have no idea what they said.</p><p>After the opening ceremony, the half marathon race was the first to gather at the starting line.  Then the clouds started to open up and let the sun in.  Ugh, it was hot.  At 9am, some old guy fired his starting pistol and everyone was off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Limits</b></div><p>Once again, just like last year, the race had a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This limit is enforced by 2 intermediary checkpoints throughout the race.  The first checkpoint is at 12.7km for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The second checkpoint is at 17.3km for 2 hours.  If you make it to these checkpoints late, the volunteers will stop you, and force you to quite.  Then you must wait for a bus to pick you up and bring you back to the start.  </p><p>Last year, I made the first checkpoint, but could not pass the second one.  I was only 1 minute late. :/</p><p>With the shape I was in this year, I had no intention of doing any better.  In order to complete the checkpoints, and the race, I needed to keep a pace of less than 7 minutes per kilometer (that's around 11 minutes per mile).</p><p>Whatever… let's get this marathon over with.</p><div class='title'><b>Running</b></div><p>Again, the course was the same.  But, since I was running at a much more leisurely pace, I stopped to take a few more photos than last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" /></p><p>I really tried at the beginning, but after 2k, my body was too fat, and heavy, and I was not going to have the energy to overcome it.  Additionally, I kept thinking about all the crap still outstanding on my to-do list, and the increasingly little time I had to complete them.  Ugh, why am I here?  Why am I doing this?  This isn't fun.  I'm not really getting anything out of this either.</p><p>The increasing pressure of all my responsibilities kept me from actually enjoying the run, and thinking about things clearly.  Usually during a marathon, I can push away all of my thoughts, empty my mind, and think about things without any noise.  My brain stops trying to analyze everything, and I can simply think…</p><p>All I could think about were my upcoming classes, and all the preparation work I still needed to do, and try to figure out when I could actually do the work.  And then think about my classes after, and how was I going to have the energy to do any of this after running this race.</p><p>So, this marathon sucked, and I did terrible at it.  Though, there were a few sparing moments I could lose myself in my music, but then came the crushing reality of my fat ass.</p><div class='title'><b>"Finishing"</b></div><p>Anyway, at around 10 o'clock, I passed the 9km marker.  I quickly thought to myself that I was still alright for time.  Only 3km left to the 12km checkpoint.  I can make that in 30 minutes.  15 minutes later, I remembered that the checkpoint was actually 12.7km, and that my pace was terrible.</p><p>I passed the 12km before the 10:30 mark, but arrived at the checkpoint more than 6 minutes late.</p><p>Whooo, failure!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't the only one there, and there were still people behind me, too.  I still have not broken my cardinal rule of not placing last in a race.  I was only 7th or 8th from last!</p><p>Once everyone else behind us got to the checkpoint, the bus of shame arrived to transport everyone back to the start.  We traversed the course backwards, and made it back to the start before 11am.  So, there were still people finishing the race as we arrived.  Our tracking chips were returned in the bus, though, so we couldn't just jump back on the track and finish the race. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" /></p><p>So, while I didn't finish the race, and did much more horribly than last year, I was able to leave much earlier and not damage my legs too much.  The race was still finishing as I walked back to my car to return to Takayama.</p><div class='title'><b>Vow</b></div><p>I still vow to complete this race in the future!  I wonder if this race happens twice a year, which explains the date change from last year.  November was way more comfortable to run, too.  The heat was terrible for this race. :(</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Speech Contest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-speech-contest">Takayama Speech Contest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 6, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Every year, the municipality of Takayama City holds an English Speech Contest for its Junior High school students.  This contest is usually held at the end of May, or beginning of June, and it's separate from the regional speech contest that leads to the nationals.  This contest is Takayama only, and allows the top 25 (or so) students to study abroad for a week in either the United States or Australia.</p><p>This year, the contest was held on <b>Saturday, May 31st</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Participation</b></div><p>Last year, I taught at Higashiyama JHS <span class='ja'>東山中</span> and we had 8 students participate in the contest.  Overall, there were 81 participates.  One of my students got 2nd in the contest!  And overall, 2 Higashiyama students were able to study abroad.</p><p>This year, I'm teaching at Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span>, which is a much smaller school then Higashiyama.  There's around 70 students compared to Higashiyama's 400.  At Kiyomi, the English department is much more open because it's just the one English teacher and me.  Both of us, together, make the team.  Higashiyama had of 4 (or 5) teachers, and I was mostly extra.  I was kept out of the loop constantly.  As such, whenever we get some city-wide fax about English, at Higashiyama I never knew about it, or anything that was going on.  At Kiyomi, everything is widely available to me, and I can take a look at it, and try to understand what's going on.</p><p>For the speech contest, I knew the information was coming down the pipeline, so I was waiting for it.  We finally got the information on April 7th, and the English teacher just gave it to me to look over.  I didn't realize this before, but the participation in the speech contest is limited based on the attendance at that particular Junior High school.  Higashiyama's 400 students allows them to enter 12 students in the contest.  Kiyomi's much smaller attendance only allows 4.</p><p>But, being at a smaller school has great advantages.  I know every student in the school, and have read all of their writing assignments.  I know about the things they like, and are passionate about.  And I know their level of English, too.  I immediately knew which students I wanted to participate in this contest.  Rather than post a notice in the classroom for everyone to ignore, I asked these students directly.  I had 8 students in mind, and asked them whether or not they were able to attend.  By the next week, I told them I wanted 4 of them to enter the contest.</p><p>By the next Friday, April 18th, I had my 4 participates.  I wasn't able to get 2 of my ideal students because they were too busy with club activities.  For my 4 students, I got them a copy of the contest information and rules, a copy of the entry form, and asked them to write me a speech in Japanese by the next Friday (4/25).  </p><p>Also, the submission deadline was Friday May 9th.  For this contest, only the entry form was required.  We were not required to submit the speech itself.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>The 25th came pretty quickly, and I received written speeches from all the students. :)  It's so nice when students actually listen and do what you ask of them.  It totally makes sense that the better English sparkers in the school are very studious, as well.  That weekend, I went through the process of translating the speeches.</p><p>Yes, I think the students probably should have tried to write the English speeches themselves, but it's very difficult to proofread and correct an English assignment when I'm not entirely sure of the meaning behind it.  I wanted a complete speech written in Japanese, so I could fully understand what they were trying to say.  I think for the next contest, I will have the students try to write the English version, in addition to the Japanese.</p><p>Translating the speeches was not as difficult as I thought it would be.  They were all handwritten, so I had to decipher the Kanji with a dictionary anyways.  As I did so, I made a running vocabulary list of the Kanji, its reading, and its meaning.  I actually knew most of the grammar in the speech, too, so after plugging in the vocabulary, I had the meaning and could write an English sentence.  Also, after I had the Japanese text typed in Word, I dumped it into Google Translate so I had an extra translation to compare with.  It wasn't usable on its own, but certainly helped catching mistakes I made.</p><p>On Monday, I had the 4 speeches translated, and gave print-outs to the English teacher for a final proofread and translation check.</p><p>I should note that at this point, the English was a <b>direct translation</b> of the Japanese.  It was not meant to be the finished speech for the students.  I wanted to establish the meaning, so I could write an actual English speech from it.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>2 of the speeches were pretty good, and 2 of the speeches were not so good.</p><p>One of the speeches was great!  It had a lot of emotion and impact.  It was about an elementary school girl was run over by a car a few months ago.  The other good speech was about club activities at school, but it told a very nice story of problems she had, and how she overcame them.  Good speech material.</p><p>The other 2 were a little short.  One speech, about greetings, didn't really have any resolution to the conflict introduced at the beginning of the speech.  The rest of the speech was alright, so I had the student write an addition paragraph to complete the conflict.</p><p>The other one was about how living in such a small town creates social roles for everyone, and that you can't break out of them.  It seemed really interesting to me, but it didn't have a story, or a purpose, or any general aim.  It just seemed like information, but even then, it wasn't presented very well.  The English teacher even mentioned that he wasn't able to understand it by reading the Japanese.</p><p>We asked her to fix it, and she just wrote a completely new speech.  This one was about club activities.  It had a similar theme to the other student's club activity speech, but it had its own voice, and was good enough.  It could have used a little more conflict, or some kind of revolution made by the speaker, but it was complete as is.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>With the translations complete, writing the 4 speeches wasn't too difficult.  I think the biggest problem with translating and writing the speeches myself is that they tend to be written in my voice, rather than the students.  </p><p>I don't really consider myself a writer, but I have been writing about random things for quite a while now.  Very early on, I made the decision to simply write exactly how I talked.  When I read someone's work, if they write how they talk, I never feel like I'm fighting the text to understand.  I understand the ideas naturally as if they actually were explaining it to me, rather than burying the meaning in pose or other literary nonsense.</p><p>Because I'm not a writer, this is how I write, and it's difficult to avoid that when writing a speech for someone else.  I think this is the second best reason to make the students write their own speeches.  (The first reason being practice.)  But, having their full Japanese text can help me identify a voice, and try to include that when writing.</p><p>In some of the speeches, I was able to identify some repetition, and uniqueness that I thought was a voice of theirs.  So, I was sure to include that rhythm into their English speech.</p><div class='title'><b>Example</b></div><p>For example, there's the following line in one of the speeches:</p><p><span class='ja'>練習の時でも、試合の時でも、何も言わなくても、今まで一緒にいた仲間だから気持ちは通じていると私達は思っていたので、お互いに声をかけ合わなかったのです。</span></p><p>I thought the repetition of <span class='ja'>でも</span>, <span class='ja'>でも</span>, <span class='ja'>ても</span> was a clear conscious writing decision.  Later in the speech, there were two other sentences that repeated 3 times to emphasis what they were trying to say.</p><p>For the above sentence, I had this translation:</p><p><i>Even when we practice.  Even when we play a game.  Even when we don’t say anything.  Up until now, because we were such close friends, we thought we could truly understand each other’s feelings without having to say anything.</i></p><p>So, when I finally wrote this into the speech, it was the following:</p><p><i>Up until now, because we were such close friends, whenever we practiced, whenever we played a game, whenever we didn’t say anything, I thought we truly understood each other’s feelings.</i></p><p>I tired to keep that same flow.</p><div class='title'><b>Preparation Materials</b></div><p>By Friday May 2nd, I had the speeches written, and I had each student read through the speech once on their own.  As they read, I circled any words or contents they had trouble saying or pronouncing correctly.  I tried not to use too many big words, but there were some instances where I should've dumbed it down more.</p><p>For each students, I now had a list of words and trouble areas I could focus on.  Over that weekend, I made CDs for the students to practice with.  The first track was of me simply reading through the speech.  I read at a pace that I felt was equal to the student's.  For the second track, I read a sentence, then left a pause of equal length.  This way the student's could repeat after the CD.  The third track focused on these problem areas.  I made a vocabulary sheet of each difficult word, and then sentence it was used in.  I read the word 3 times with a pause for the student to repeat.  Then I read the sentence 3 times with pauses.</p><p>By the next week, I had the following things for each student:  1 written speech, 1 vocabulary sheet, and 1 CD.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7506.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7506.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7509.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7509.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7509.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Practice</b></div><p>Now the students could practice on their own, and have an English example to emulate.  In addition, starting on May 9th, before school, and during the lunch recess, I scheduled times for each students to meet with me, and meet with the English teacher to perform and practice their speeches in person.  </p><p>I didn't make this known to the student, but I had the following checklist, or flowchart, or whatever when teaching the students how to perform their speech.</p><p>1. Pronunciation<br/>2. Rhythm<br/>3. Memorizing<br/>4. Gestures / Attitude / Performance</p><p>First, I focused a lot on the pronunciation of their speech.  I made sure their Rs, Ls, THs, etc sounded good.  As well as other difficult words.  Most of this is covered on the CD for the students to practice at home.  When I'm actually practicing with the student in person, the student can watch my mouth to see how to make the correct sounds.</p><p>Once they had great pronunciation, I moved to the next item: rhythm.  There's a lot of ups and downs, and short pauses when saying sentences in English.  There's plenty of words that are combined when speaking, too.  One student's speeches had "in an instant" which is slurred when spoken.</p><p>After they had the pronunciation, rhythm and flow of the speech down, they had to memorize it.  I'm not sure how much the students practiced the speeches on their own, but only one of the students actually memorized their speech.  And even they weren't 100% perfect, and still needed a few cues.  Again, I referred them to the CD.  They could try to recite their speech by listening to the CD and repeat without looking at their speech's script.</p><p>The last step "gestures, attitude, and performance" is really what makes the speech.  It's what elevates the contents of the speech into something interesting and memorable.  Everything else is extremely important, but those are all building blocks to what wins the competition.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't make it to this step.  The English teacher was very busy planning the 3<span class='ja'>年生</span> school trip, and managing the school's baseball team, that he rarely made it to any of the scheduled times.  So, the times were all double booked, and I wasn't able to dedicate the time needed to each student.</p><p>To improve this process, I think I should make this known to the students.  Also, I need to schedule a strict deadline of when they need to memorize their speech.  Gestures, and attitude can be taught along the way, but I don't want to overwhelm them with all the steps at once.  Once they memorize the speech, I think that's when they can remember that kind of advice and actually use it.</p><p>I practiced with the students for the next 3 weeks.  On the last day before the contest, the English teacher had them perform their speeches in class.  The students were super nervous, but I think it was really good for them.  It was the first time they actually performed to an audience.  We should've done this much earlier, and more often.</p><div class='title'><b>Competition</b></div><p>May 31st finally arrived.  The doors of the competition opened at 9am, and all the students began to arrive.  This year, we only had 51 students in the contest.  (Last year was 81.)  There were no 1<span class='ja'>年生</span> students for some reason.</p><p>My students were really nervous, but they arrived, and had a good attitude.  I think some of them hated it, but they still faced the challenge, and performed their speeches when they were called on.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8592.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8592.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8592.webp" /></p><p>At the end of the competition, the top 5 students were given awards.  None of my students made the top 5, but that's perfectly fine.  I think it was an accomplishment for them to have entered and performed their speeches in the first place.  It's not the first time any of them had to read in front of an audience.  But it was the first time they wrote, rehearsed, and performed their own material to a large crowd.  They were quite nervous, but they overcame their fears for those brief minutes.</p><p>Hopefully some of them will get the opportunity to study abroad. :)  I think that would be an amazing experience for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>With the competition over and behind them, I printed a bunch of photos and gave them to the students as a present.</p><p>Additionally, I created a sheet for each of the students that included their English speech and some photos.  I printed each one, and posted it outside the English room for all the students in the school to view.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8865.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8865.webp" /></p><p>Hopefully this will motivate more students to want to do the contest.</p><div class='title'><b>Update! (June 14th)</b></div><p>Apparently, all 4 of my students did well enough to be selected for studying abroad to Australia this summer!  Nice!  I hope that take advantage of the opportunity and see more of this world. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Fresh Start (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start-2">A Fresh Start (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 27, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About 2 months, I started working on a dream of mine.  A dream that I've had for many many years.  Throughout those years, I had many ideas, wants and desires, but never had the motivation to put them into code.</p><p>2 months ago, in the midst of finalizing classes for the year, and being monstrously busy with all kinds of nonsense, I had the urge to put this together.  Everything was so clear in my head.</p><p>It's one of those moments, where you feel the weight of your To-Do list, and just can't bring yourself to do anything on it.  That moment when your mind wonders, and you think about something else you could be doing.  Something equally constructive, but way more fun.  For that day, I didn't want to do anymore lesson planning, and I missed Software Development enough.</p><p>At that moment, it was time for me to finally do this.</p><p>It was time to finally rewrite theschlock.com as its own application with all of my own code, and design.</p><p>And on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th</a>, the new theschlock.com was running on line for the first time.  Today, it's finally (basically) finished!</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>2 years prior, I had already created a Tapestry 5 project that ran in Jetty completely standalone from anything I had at Widen.  And I had things already organized for where I wanted to start adding classes.  </p><p>From the beginning, I knew that I wanted to write this site in Java using Tapestry 5 and Hibernate.  They were technologies I was used to.  Much of the work I did at Widen was on the backs of others smarter than me that had already built systems for others to use.  I wanted to learn how to use these technologies from scratch to better understand how they work.</p><div class='title'><b>Code Decisions</b></div><p>On the back end, there were several other decisions that I had made WELL before any code was written.</p><p>1.  This site will not have comments.  </p><p>At least, nothing internal.  I learned a long time ago from MovableType and Wordpress that any web form left unattended will get massively spammed by bots, and who knows what else.  (In the future, I might add Facebook comments if I can fit them into the design.)</p><p>2.  Further than that!  This site will only have read access to the database.</p><p>I did not want to deal with security in any manor for this site.  Nothing on the Internet is every truly secure, and anyone who would want to tear into my database has way more time, and expertise on their side.  Any wall is just an invitation, so why have any walls in the first place.  And, if I did have security, I would probably just mess it up.</p><div class='title'><b>Road Blocks</b></div><p>In any project, you'll hit a road block.  You'll come across something you don't understand, or a problem you just can't figure out.</p><p>When it's a personal project, it is very easy to just call it quits.  You're the only person on the project, and you are really the only person that cares about the outcome.  If you call it quit, it really only affects you.</p><p>Maybe it's been all those years at Widen dealing with road blocks on a daily basis, or maybe I'm just more comfortable with writing code than I was in college, or maybe I'm just more grown up now, too, and experienced.</p><p>Any road blocks I came across with this project were eventually overcome.  Any problem, or misunderstanding just took a little bit of patience, time, and (sometimes) research to think it through and figure out a solution.</p><p>Figuring out Hibernate was easy.  (Though, tapestry does all the work.)  Implementing LessCss wasn't really difficult either.  Getting tomcat running, and setting things up on a new host took some time, but I just needed to read through documentation, and chat with tech support for my host.  Figuring out how to get Japanese text working in the database took a little while, too.</p><p>Nothing was outside of my ability, and I was able to do everything I wanted.</p><div class='title'><b>Back Up</b></div><p>Theschlock.com is really just a mirror of what I have locally.  <b>I never have to worry about losing something online</b> because it's just a copy.  All the code is stored on <a href="http://github.com/dyreschlock" title="http://github.com/dyreschlock">Git Hub</a>, so I'll never lose it.</p><p>Every time I make a new post, I insert it into my local database directly with no interface.  To deploy those changes online, I make a backup, and then restore the online database with the backup.  This is AMAZING because it ensures that I will always have a backup of my data, and that the backup works!  I put every backup into my Google Drive, so I'll never lose that data either.</p><p>All my photos for theschlock.com are on both Google Drive, and my web server.  Even if all that data is lost on the server, I can just upload everything again from Google Drive.</p><p>Every time I make changes to my site, I'm redeploying it in a way that could be done any web host, not just the one I'm using now.  </p><p>This sense of security is something I NEVER had with Wordpress, or any blog software for that matter.  If any of those blogs died, everything I worked on would be gone forever.  I never have to worry about that with this approach.  Every aspect of this site is backed up, and will never be lost.  (Unless github and google are lost.)</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Writing code is pretty easy.  You just need to keep things organized, simple, and then make sure they work.  <b>Design</b> is much different beast, and a very easy road block to kill this whole project.  I haven't done much design work in the last 7 years.  And there were many times when I would design something on paper, and it would look terrible after its implementation.</p><p>The Wordpress design I had before wasn't too bad, but I didn't want the side bars.  I knew what I wanted, and those translated into User stories easily, and then to Tapestry Pages from there.</p><p>1.  The index page would be the most recent post on the site.<br/>2.  The post must be the most prominent thing on the page.<br/>3.  No side bars.  Only show the post.<br/>4.  The site must translate to mobile well.<br/>5.  Keep it simple stupid.</p><p>Like usual, my design from scratch looked like garbage.  As dumb as it sounds, searching for "good blog designs" on google gave me a lot of inspiration. :)  </p><p>I paged through a couple articles highlighting the best of the web and came across <b>Dan Cederholm's</b> website: <a href="http://simplebits.com/" title="http://simplebits.com/">Simple Bits</a>.  Holy shit, this guy's design was beautifully simple.  It hit all 5 points of my check list, and was very sharp.</p><p>I went to work using the top-down approach and the site pulled itself together pretty easily.  After my initial implementation, I had my friend <a href="http://www.mlatzke.com/" title="http://www.mlatzke.com/">Matt Latzke</a> take a look at it.  He suggested that I add a lot more spacing between components, and choose a second complimentary font for titles, and things.</p><div class='title'><b>Fonts</b></div><p>My favorite serif font is Garamond.  I've been using Garamond for my resume, term papers, and almost anything I've typed since my beginning days in college.  I wanted something better than Times New Roman, and Garamond just has a sleek simplicity to itself.  I don't know, I can't really describe it.</p><p>Matt suggested that using Garamond for absolutely every piece of text on the site was design overkill.  I didn't think it looked too bad, but having only one font did make the site feel a bit…  I dunno…  sheltered?</p><p>Anyway, I went to google again, and searched for good complimentary web fonts for Garamond.  Helvetica came up a bunch, but I didn't really like the way it looked with Garamond.  Eventually, I came across Gill Sans.  When bolded, it really stood out against Garamond.  It had very fat, but clean letters.  Very stylish, and different.</p><div class='title'><b>Archives</b></div><p>One other strong point I wanted for this site was the ease of getting to past posts, and finding everything on the site with only a few clicks.  I really hate Wordpress's pages for categories and archiving.  I want my users to be able to see everything, and find everything, and view it all in a small space.</p><p>My initial designs were terrible again, but thanks to Ray at Widen, he sent everyone a link to site with an amazing design: <a href="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html" title="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html">Rob Ashton's Blog</a>.  This site is so incredibly simple.  If I had seen this 2 months ago, theschlock.com would probably look different.</p><p>For the archives…  Shit, just dump out all the post titles on the page and line 'em up.  Nothing is more simpler than that!</p><p>I wanted to have some featured posts, too, and display an image to draw the user in.  I really like how <a href="http://www.theverge.com" title="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a> handles their recent posts on the category pages, highlights posts with images, and still keeps the design nice and clean.</p><p>I started doing something like that, but those highlighted posts naturally fell to the side of the categories and post titles.  Everything just fit together that way.</p><div class='title'><b>(Basically) Finished</b></div><p>Figuring out the design for the archive and category pages was really the last unfinished feature.  With that now complete, theschlock.com is (basically) finished!  Obviously, I'll probably change a few things here and there down the road, but this is it.</p><p>The site does pretty much everything I ever wanted, and I'm in complete control of all aspects.</p><p>"It's the [website] I've always wanted, and now I have it.  I rule!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Intro Lesson - Self Intro and Name Tags" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lessons-h26-special-self-intro-and-name-tags">Intro Lesson - Self Intro and Name Tags</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 10, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Even though all the teachers in the schools moved around and changed positions, I'm still at the same schools, and teaching the same students.  All the students already know me, so doing another Self Introduction is really redundant, and doesn't really make sense.  I still wanted an introductory lesson, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Self Intro Quiz</b></div><p>All these students already know me, and I've told them plenty about myself.  I wanted to see just how much they remember.  I came up with 10 questions, but really only had time for 5 or 6 in class.  I split the class into 3 or 4 groups, depending on class size.  I'd ask the kids a question, and let them talk amongst themselves to come up with the answer.</p><p>I asked the following:</p><p><i>How many brothers and sisters do I have?</i> / <span class='ja'>兄弟は何人</span>？ / <span class='ja'>きょうだいはなんにん</span>？<br/><i>How tall am I?</i> / <span class='ja'>身長は何センチ</span>？ / <span class='ja'>しんちょうはなんセンチ</span>？<br/><i>How old am I?</i> / <span class='ja'>何歳</span>？ / <span class='ja'>なんさい</span>？<br/><i>What's my favorite animal?</i> / <span class='ja'>一番好きな動物は何ですか</span>？ / <span class='ja'>いちばんすきなどぼつ</span>…<br/><i>What's my favorite Japanese food?</i> / <span class='ja'>一番好きな日本の食べ物は何ですか</span>？ / <span class='ja'>いちばんすきなにほんのたべもの</span>…</p><p>Several times, some students would be right, but the majority would overrule them.  I didn't award them any points for that, but those kids were certainly smug, and the kids started listening to them after the fact.</p><p>Overall, most students didn't really remember the details.  Some students remembered correctly, but most team scores were either 1 or 2 correct out of 5.  One of my classes remembered really well, and each team had 3 or 4 correct at the end, and wanted to keep playing. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Nametags</b></div><p>For the last year, I was able to memorize all the students names (both first and last) in my Junior High.  Sure, I see them all 3 times a week, but what really helped me learn their names was their English name tags.  Someone before me printed a bunch of them out, laminated them, and put a safety pin on the back.  Passing them out each class, and calling on students by name in each class, was an amazing help.</p><p>After 8 months, I knew only a couple of names from my elementary schools.  So, one of my goals for this year is to learn as many names as I can.  And making name tags should definitely help that.</p><p>Also, I wanted to make the name tags myself, so everyone single one was the exact same style, and I could read the name at a glance.  If the students made their own name tags, they'd be poorly written, possibly misspelled, and may not even be their complete name.  Sure, I would have some control over that, but it would eat into class time.</p><div class='title'><b>Creation</b></div><p>To create the name tags, I followed a similar process used for those name tags already made in my Junior High.  As usual, I used the Century Gothic font because the a's and g's are both written that how they're taught.  Plus, I'm pretty sure the text book uses Century Gothic, too.</p><p>I fit 6 names on a page, printed all those out on pure white paper, laminated them, cut them out, and then punched two holes in the tops.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4431.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4431.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4431.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4432.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4432.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4432.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4433.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4433.webp" /></p><p>All of this step used office supplies, so there was no additional cost from me.</p><p>I did spend money for the yarn, though.  I didn't see anything at the schools that would work well for string and be in such massive supply.  Maybe the Home Ec room would've had something…  But, I wanted a bunch of colors, and I knew that the craft store would have it.  </p><p>I bought 6 colors, and each ball of yarn is about 60m.  I figured that each name tag would probably use about half a meter.  So thats 120 tags per ball.  6 balls should definitely cover my needs.</p><p>Each ball was 350<span class='ja'>円</span>, so the bill was a little more than 2100<span class='ja'>円</span> after they added tax.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4463.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4463.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4424.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4423.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4423.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4426.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4426.webp" /></p><p>I ended up cutting the string a bit longer than half a meter, but I had plenty to spare.</p><div class='title'><b>Cost</b></div><p>I spent about $20 on the yarn, but the real cost is time.</p><p>Again, I teach at 3 elementary schools.  2 of the schools only have 1 class per grade, and I teach them all.  The other school has 2 classes, and I teacher 4th grade and up.  Adding things up, I teach 18 unique classes, and needed to create name tags for each of the students.  All in all, I created 550 name tags, plus another 20 including all the Homeroom Teachers.</p><p>Typing all the names into the computer took quite a while.  There was plenty of proofreading, as well as asking teachers for English names for the non-Japanese students.</p><p>The laminating machine runs pretty slow, so laminating all those name cards takes a while.  I multitasked with the paper cutter, to try and maximize my time.  </p><p>I did individually cut each card, just to make sure there were no screw-ups.  If there's a more precise way of cutting huge piles of papers, that could save a lot of time.</p><p>My hole puncher could only handle 6 cards at once, so that was yet another time bottleneck.  There could certainly be a more efficient way of doing that, too.</p><p>And then cutting all the string, and tying each name tag individually takes time, too.</p><p>All in all, it probably took me about <b>1 1/2 hours</b> or <b>2 hours</b> to complete name tags for <b>each class</b>.  With 18 classes, that's a total of up to <b>36 hours</b>.  It wasn't too bad, though.  I didn't do all of this at once, just a little bit each day.  I watched a bunch of movies and internet videos while stringing the name tags at home, too.</p><p>But!  There are exactly what I wanted. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4429.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4429.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>"Business Card" Game</b></div><p>This game was introduced by another ALT in Takayama.  The basic concept is that students introduce themselves to each other, then they switch identities.  In this context, after introducing themselves, the students will switch name tags, and now they'll introduce themselves as whatever name tag they have.  I added some difficulty with the ５<span class='ja'>年生</span> and ６<span class='ja'>年生</span> by also making them say something they liked, and then remembering that when introducing themselves as that person.</p><p>Overall, the kids thought this was hilarious, and loved introducing themselves as someone else.  The students did have a little difficulty remembering the names and liked things.  Some of the younger students have some difficulty reading the name tags.</p><p>But, it was fine.  Everyone seemed engaged and had fun. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>Overall, these classes went pretty damn well.  It was great to start the year on a high point with everyone communicating with each other, smiling and having fun.  All the students were very engaged in both the quiz and the game.</p><p>Definitely a success. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to ALT Materials" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/alt-materials">ALT Materials</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 13, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I am currently an ALT in Takayama City, Gifu through the JET program.  </p><p>I started in January 2013, and worked in 1 Junior High and 2 Elementary schools.  My schools were fairly large.  My Junior High had about 400 students, and my main elementary school had 600.  My other elementary school was super tiny and had only 18 students in the entire school.  Because of the size, my elementary schools basically planned all the lessons, and I created materials and then followed their plan in class.</p><p>Well, things change.  In August 2013, I switched to much smaller schools.  I now have one Junior High with only 70 students.  And I have 3 elementary schools of 150, 200, and 400 students.  In the smaller 2 elementary schools I teach all grades, and in the other school, I teach 4th, 5th, and 6th.  My position is much more focused on elementary school teaching now.  Also, I am in the only English teacher in my elementary schools, so I do all the planning, material creating, and executing in class.</p><div class='title'><b>Lessons</b></div><p>The following are all my lesson plans I've written for use in my 3 elementary schools.  For all of my classes, I have 4 different levels that I write for:  6th, 5th, 4th and 3rd, and 2nd and 1st.  5th and 6th are the only grades that have a specific curriculum to follow.  The other grades are simply at the whim of the ALT.  The younger grades tend to have way more games, and repetition.</p><p>Most of the ideas I used for these lessons came from Englipedia, other Takayama ALTs and teachers, the recommended lesson plans, plans from my predecessor, the Team Teaching Pizza book, and random other websites.  Sometimes I get an original idea and try it out.</p><p>For each of these lessons, I will write out the plans almost a week in advance and discuss the upcoming class with the homeroom teachers.  I will ask for any help I need from them, and get their OK on the plan before executing in class.  After teaching the classes for long enough, you'll get a sense for the student's limits of English and study, but it's always good to talk with the teacher and explain anything you might think is challenging, or possibly difficult for the students.</p><div class='title'><b>Textbook</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140313_alt/IMG_3584.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140313_alt/IMG_3584.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140313_alt/IMG_3584.webp" /></p><p>In the official declaration of the Ministry of Education, in elementary school, only 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> and 6<span class='ja'>年生</span> are required to learn English.  They must have 35 hours throughout the entire year.  And this is the current text book the students are issued.  Hi Friends 1 and 2 - <span class='ja'>平成</span>24<span class='ja'>年</span>4<span class='ja'>月</span> version.  You can buy a copy of the textbook on Amazon for 95<span class='ja'>円</span>. :)  All my lesson plans and flash cards are based on this book, and occasionally I'll actually do an activity directly from the book.  I use the text book for a general layout of all my lessons throughout the year, but almost all the the instruction is in class teaching directly.  </p><div class='title'><b>Flash Cards</b></div><p>One really nice thing about Hi Friends is that the Data CD contains full PDF versions of each book.  Almost all the artwork in the book is in Vector format, which is AMAZING.  Most of the flashcards I've made for my classes has been from rasterizing those PDFs is various sizes.  It produces lossless perfect images.  But when the book doesn't provide good flash cards, I usually resort to Google Image Search, and try to find large photos aren't terribly quality.</p><div class='title'><b>Updated</b></div><p>This page now exists here: <a href="/old/v7/lessons" title="/lessons">ALT Materials & Lesson Plans</a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Fresh Start" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start">A Fresh Start</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been over 10 years since I started writing about random things on the Internet.  It started with some emo poetry.  Soon after, I began posting more daily journal style entries, along with photos from club events.  2003 was when I broke away from geocities, and tripod, and registered the url: theschock.com.  I hosted drawings, and photos, and still typed away pretty regularly.  </p><p>In the beginning, I used MovableType.  Some of my friends were using that with their blogs, and swore by it.  It wasn't too bad.  In 2006, I was about to go to Japan for the first time as a study abroad student, and I wanted something new for my website before I left.  In that summer, I installed Wordpress, and have been using that since.  Wordpress was easy to install, and easy to add posts, and everything.  But I never really liked it.  Templates were difficult to design, and PHP is a terrible language.  But, whatever.  It was fine.</p><p>I vowed to completely redo this website at some point.  Especially after working as a Software Developer designing and developing web applications, you'd think I would actually come up with something amazing.  But no.  Wordpress stayed installed and collected all the posts I wrote.</p><p>All this time I was with the same host, Collosalhost.  From the very beginning in 2003, they've been hosting all my stupid crap.  2009 was the first time, I had some trouble with them.  They had some massive server loss, and lost almost 50% of their customers data to some failure.  They had backups for everyone, but that was the first time, after putting things on the Internet that I thought things might actually be over.  I wrote about it a little bit here: <a href="/old/v7/the-website-is-down" title="/the-website-is-down">May 29th, 2009</a>.  Wordpress stayed up, and I continued to be lazy.  2012 was finally when I started laying the groundwork, and created my own Tapestry 5 build free from my job.</p><p>Six months ago, Collosalhost shut down my Wordpress blog without telling me.  A week or two went by and I finally emailed them and asked them what was going on.  "blah blah you don't update the version, blah blah security risk."  Well, it would've been nice to be notified, rather than having to ask about it.  And the email continued on with its condescending patronizing attitude.  Christ.  This is how to treat your customers, huh?</p><p>Well today, all those dreams and ambitions have finally been realized, and I've finally redone my website completely from the ground-up!  A new design, a new host, and everything is completely written from scratch in Java using Tapestry 5, Hibernate, and Tomcat.</p><p>Some of the things aren't fully implemented yet, but you can view all my posts from the last 10 years.  All 612 of them from my MovableType and Wordpress blogs, plus a few more I hadn't posted yet. :)</p><p>All in all, this would be the 8th or 9th version of my website?  I think.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Christmas" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lessons-h25-special-christmas">Christmas</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 25, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last class of the calendar year, I did Christmas lessons with my students.  Most classes were dated nicely the week or two before Christmas, but two of the last classes were back in November.  I thought it would be awkward for a Christmas lesson in November, so I just didn't do it for those classes.</p><div class='title'><b>Christmas Wish Tree</b></div><p>For the older classes, we made Christmas wish trees.  This class was amazingly relaxing, and great way to end the year stress free.  I passed out a bunch of green paper, and the students drew their hands.  Where the <b>English</b> comes into the lesson is that they're to write what they want for Christmas on the fingers.  If they don't know the English, then they can ask me, and they learn a bunch of new words that they're interested in.</p><div class='title'><b>Christmas Vocabulary</b></div><p>For the younger grades, making a Christmas wish tree is difficult, so we simply did a lesson with Christmas vocabulary.  And I talked a little bit about Christmas in the United States.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>Overall, the Christmas Tree was a great way to end the year.  It brought the whole class together to create something.  It was relaxing because I was basically working with the students, rather than teaching them, and running the class.</p><p>The ３<span class='ja'>年生</span> class was JUST barely able to do the Christmas wish tree.  Our class didn't finish on time, and the Homeroom teacher basically took 10 or 15 minutes out of their next classes to assemble the tree themselves.  I went by later and saw how it came out.  The difficulty layed with writing the English words.</p><div class='title'><b>The Song</b></div><p>For some classes, I taught them "We wish you a Merry Christmas", but that really ate into the time for the class.  Making the Christmas Tree takes the entire 45 minutes, and there's really no extra time at all.  I could've probably had it playing in the background.  Or I could've gotten a whole mix of Christmas songs to play in the background while everyone worked.  That probably would've been better.</p><p>I choose "We wish you a Merry Christmas" because there's only 4 different lines of lyrics.  But, like choosing any song, it took forever to find something just right.  Many versions of "We wish you a Merry Christmas" have more than just those 4 lyrics.</p><p>Originally, I went with Weezer's "Wish you a Merry Christmas" because I liked how it sounded.  It had those extra lyrics, but I thought it'd be OK.  The students hated that song.  They couldn't stand it.  And the teacher was the same way.  I mean, I didn't hate the song, but I could take it or leave it.</p><p>I switched to use the Barbie Christmas Carol version of the song.  I thought it had the perfect tone.  It was whimsical and musical.  Plus, it only had those 4 lines, too!  The problem with this song is the speed.  It's way too fast.  Some of the students could sing along and keep up, but others were struggling to keep pace.</p><p>Also, the younger kids had trouble saying, "tidings."</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon">Takaoka Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I came to Japan to work, I had 3 goals for the year.  One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
