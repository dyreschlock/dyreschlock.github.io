The Wall consisted of any numbers of cars positioned upright for a car to easily plow right through.  Apparently the world record is going through a 10 car Wall.</p><p>So..  the guy drove and the track once..  waving to the crowd.  He got his speed up enough and WHAM.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0334.webp" /></p><p>bye bye car..  let's see a closeup of that!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0334_closeup.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0334_closeup.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0334_closeup.webp" /></p><p>The car went flying, and the announcer is the b4u car is perfectly fine, as he flounders a victory lap.  The rest of the event featured several different alterations of the circular track with different modes.</p><p>There was the chain race, where two car are chained together and the first group to cross the finish while still attached is the winner.  There was the bump 'n run, which is a tag team race.  One team member drives around the track and then bumps into his teammate at the finish line.  Then that teammate drives around the track and does the same for several laps.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" /></p><p>There was the 360 race, where each car had to spin 360 degrees around the finish lap for the lap to count</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" /></p><p>Then they began to change up the course a little bit, using the the little 'pit' area near the finish line.

| September 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I came across this amazing documentary entitled: Dangerous Knowledge.  It's been passed around the internet quite a bit, so there's a possibility you may have seen it pop up since it's debut yesterday.  The website, Best Free Documentaries, has got it right here:</p><p><a href="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html" title="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html">http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html</a></p><p>Dangerous Knowledge is about 4 amazing mathematicians who descended into madness trying to solve some impossible questions..</p><div class='title'><b>Georg Canter</b></div><p>Canter, a German mathematician, is the first subject of this documentary born 1845 died 1918.  His birth of madness began with trying to understand the infinite.  He could not accept that one infinite space is equal to another infinite space..</p><p>for example: a 1 by 1 square contains an infinite amount of points.  well, a 2 by 1 square also contains an infinite amount of points.  Through Mathematics, both infinities are equal.  Well this can't be!  The 2 by 1 square has twice the area as the 1 by 1 square.  Surely the infinite space of the 2 by 1 is at least twice the size as the 1 by 1 square.  But Mathematics says No!  It's the same.</p><p>Logically this makes no sense, so Canter sought to proves that there are an infinite amount of infinities, which became known as Canter's Theorem.  Well..  doing so totally unraveled the thought of mathematics.  Simple things became untrue.  This doesn't make any sense either..  So he began working at it the other way..  Since these simple basics of mathematics are true, then they shall disprove his infinite infinites..  Well he found out to also be impossible.</p><p>Day by Day he worked on this until his son died..  and with his son's death, he lost a part of himself.  He killed himself because of what he lost because of his failure to prove or disprove his theorem.  There's also some religious mumbo-jumbo in there too.</p><div class='title'><b>Ludwig Boltzmann</b></div><p>Boltzmann is our second case and lived in the same time frame, born 1844 died 1906.  Boltzmann was physicist and hypothesized that time is irreversible.  Time is not something that can be defined on two way plane, it is an ever-driving forward concept that can never be stopped.</p><p>Today, we already know this.  In fact, this is what modern physics is based on today.  Boltzmann, unfortunately, discovered this fact 20 years too early, before later physicists adopted the truth.  But because he lived in a time of unquestionable obedience to world leaders, such a massive concept was utterly opposed because of what it implicated.</p><p>The severe oppositions to Boltzmann's discovery drove him into a deep depression that he escaped when he committed suicide.</p><p>The final two cases are of <b>Kurt Godel</b> and <b>Alan Turing</b>, who both saw Canter's work, believed to have understood it, and began to solve it in their own ways.  Both men were born around the times of the Boltzmann's and Canter's deaths.</p><div class='title'><b>Kurt Godel</b></div><p>Godel was an Austrian mathematician who fell into the same madness that Canter had suffered from, but began looking at the problem a little differently.  Through trying to understand why infinite was undefinable, he began to understand certainty and completeness.  He set forth to define these abstract topics..</p><div class='title'><b>Alan Turing</b></div><p>Out of these 4, Alan Turing is the most I was familiar with prior to the film.  Alan Turing is particularly famous in the field of Artificial Intelligence and modern Computer Science as well.  He figured that if this theorem was actually solvable then a Computer could surely figure it out.</p><div class='title'><b>The Halting Problem</b></div><p>This where Turing had developed one of his most famous Theorems: the halting problem.  The basic thought of the theorem is how do you tell if a problem is unsolvable..  In AI class back in Platteville, Professor Hasker put this problem in terms of finding infinite loops in your code.  Is there ever a way to determine whether your program is stuck in an infinite loop, or does it just take a really long time to run?  How do you determine this way code?<br/><pre><br/><pre>//paraphrased from old notes from Hasker's class<br/>//http://www.uwplatt.edu/csse/courses/prev/s07/cs303/notes/303n01.html</p><p>public void work(String input)<br/>{<br/><span/>   if( terminatesOnInput(input) )<br/><span/>   {<br/><span/>      //statement #1<br/><span/>      sysout("Program can operate on passed input");<br/><span/>   }<br/><span/>   else<br/><span/>   {<br/><span/>      //statement #2<br/><span/>      sysout("Program is caught in an infinite loop while processing input");<br/><span/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/></pre><br/>There no possible way statement #2 will ever be called, because the terminatesOnInput will be stuck in an infinite loop, BUT how do we know that the input passed is such that it just takes a while.  Are you going to wait a week to see if the input takes a week to process?  Or is it just unsolvable?</p><p>In the real world, if something takes more than a minute or two, there's something wrong..  but in the research field, in philosophy and mathematics, how long is too long?</p><div class='title'><b>Turing's madness</b></div><p>How could you not go crazy thinking about this?  Turing began to think of Canter's continuum theorem as the difference between humans and machines.  Machines are irrefutable logic devices which can solve anything, so us, as humans, most possess an extra attribute beyond the capacity of a computer to go above and beyond.  He thought of this as our intuition, but he figured that machines had the capability to intuitively seek out answers and grow..</p><p>He absorbed himself so much in this problem that he could not tell the difference between Human and Machine.  What was it to be human, and how could this NOT be replicated with machine..</p><p>Anywho, to Turing's defense, foundationally it wasn't the halting problem or the continuum theorem that ultimately led to his death.  He was homosexual, in a time when homosexuality was a mental deficiency.  He was very open about it as well, which didn't take too long for "concerned" citizens to commit him to an insane asylum.</p><p>The treatment for homosexuality was pumping him full of estrogen, which doesn't make any sense at all early-mid 1900 doctors.  Turing began to grow breasts and other womanly features..  Turing began to contradict himself as he contradicted humanity..  and killed himself as a result of overwhelming uncertainty.</p><div class='title'><b>Check it out</b></div><p>Pretty crazy stuff, eh?  Definitely check out the full hour and a half commercial free presentation linked above at <a href="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html" title="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html">Best Free Documentaries</a>.  Well worth the watch or listen to.  Especially since they refer to Math as Maths.</p><p>I should really check out more mathematics documentaries..  That one we watched for Math History about Fermat's Last Theorem was an equally interesting watch.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Migrations" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/migrations">Migrations</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings all, today is Labor Day, which is a paid vacation day at my place of business.  So instead of going into the office I can do whatever I want.  Funny that, I ended up spending close to 6 hours both finishing up that poorly written Metroid Prime and migrating all my Movable Type journal entries to this Wordpress blog.</p><p>The main bulk of that time was cutting out the 24,000 comments from prescription drug companies, magazine, and pornographic websites.  After toying around, they were all posted on one article, so cutting them out was pretty easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Exporting Movable Type into Wordpress</b></div><p>Movable Type's exporting is quite amazing, by the way.  It dumps all the articles into a text file   They have a bizzare format, but it's still pretty readable:<br/><pre>--------<br/>AUTHOR: dyre<br/>TITLE: stuff?<br/>STATUS: Draft<br/>ALLOW COMMENTS: 0<br/>CONVERT BREAKS: __default__<br/>ALLOW PINGS: 0<br/>PRIMARY CATEGORY: daily<br/>CATEGORY: daily</p><p>DATE: 10/09/2003 08:43:39 AM<br/>-----<br/>BODY:<br/>omitted boring emotional text.<br/>-----<br/>EXTENDED BODY:</p><p>-----<br/>EXCERPT:</p><p>-----<br/>KEYWORDS:</p><p>-----</pre><br/><pre><br/>--------</pre><br/>Even though Wordpress is an annoying piece of crap, it has a convient "import from Movable Type" feature, which is very helpful.  So Importing all these old entries really only took 5 minutes.  200 more articles in 5 whole minutes..  not bad.</p><div class='title'><b>Upkeep on old stale articles</b></div><p>Despite my best judgement, I decided not to cut out content related to my life at the time, so there's plenty of school related articles talking about how lazy I can be, what classes I was attending, what homework I need to do and also several articles talking about my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>All those personal articles really tappered off when broke up with her and took a 9 or 10 month break from the internet, so around April 2004 my articles became more about the subject I was writting about and less about what I did that weekend or how I felt about the crushing stress of finishing off a semester at Platteville.  Paints an emotional picture doesn't it?</p><p>To fit all these new articles, I added a couple new categories, and also organized them into sub-groups.  I also made an <b>Opinion</b> category for all my reviews, gamelogs, and impressions about various Games, Moves, Music Events and such.</p><div class='title'><b>Still more</b></div><p>There are still plenty of articles that predate installing Movable Type that I haven't gathered up, but I could easily make a program that would convert all those entries into a Movable Type backup file, and have Wordpress import them.  Handy!</p><p>Many of these are very old reviews, but are still pretty funny..  like my Treasure Planet review, Kingdom Hearts review, and Magnolia review..  Now that I finished up Metroid, maybe that's what I'll work on.</p><div class='title'><b>Bored?</b></div><p>Well, if you're really bored, feel free to go back in time and read all those articles.  It's not like these haven't already been on the internet over at <a href="/old/v7/journal" title="/journal">theschlock.com/journal</a>, so you don't really gain anything new from reading them, unless you haven't read them.  You'd probably want to use the Search engine and category trees to your advantage to finding the better articles though.</p><p>Some of my old reviews are kinda funny at least.  especially my timely <a href="/old/v7/metriod-prime-2-impressions" title="/metriod-prime-2-impressions">Metroid Prime 2 review</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>ADVICE</b></div><p>by the way, NEVER use wordpress's entry edited for writing your blog posts.  Wordpress uses some funky CSS and Javascript to make your articles look like they do after you submit them.  BUT because of this, the text field is not longer a trackable DOM field.  SO when you submit an article, the text is immediately whisked away to the HTTP request and the field is blanked out.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means if you end up getting any browser errors, domain errors.. basically any error at all: <b><em>You lose your entire post!</em></b>  I've had this happen to me enough, that I don't even use the editor unless I'm actually edited an entry.</p><p>I use Wordpad to actually write out all my entries, and then I just copy and paste them into the editor, hit save, and then hit publish.</p><p>I'm currently using Wordpress 2.0.4, so maybe they've fixed it, but I'm not taking any chances anymore.  Especially when Firefox is somewhat buggy too and can crash at will.</p><p>Something to think about anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Concurrency in Java" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/concurrency-in-java">Concurrency in Java</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hey everyone.  These past few days, I've been doing a lot of work making some of our processors concurrently work on things.  Concurrency is the idea of having your program do many things at once, rather than linearly.  The major positive of doing this is a sharp performance gain.  For example, if you have 10 tasks that take 1 minute each to accomplish.  If you have one person do all these tasks it'll take 10 minutes.  If you have 10 equal people do one each, it'll take 1 minute to do all the work.  Pretty basic concept.</p><p>What's not so basic is how to go about implementing this in your code.  Let's say you have a function that does your work to complete this task:<br/><pre>public void doWork()<br/>{<br/>   ...<br/>}</pre><br/>and you have some Manager Class that is continuously running, looking for something to do.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         doWork();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>where acquireWork() will return null if there's no work to do.  Pretty standard operations.  You give this thing 10 1 minute tasks, it'll take 10 minutes to do them.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's use Threading!</b></div><p>Let's split some of this stuff up and use Threading.  Threads will spawn a new process that works aside from your current program.  When you start up a Thread, your main process will go on its merry way and let the thread do all the work.</p><p>To make a process run on a thread, you need your class to implement Runnable, and put all your work in the run() method you must implement..  So, let's do that with our doWork method.<br/><pre>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>now, back in our while(true) loop, we can spin off threads to do all the work, rather than getting holding up processor time doing all the work ourselves.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         new Thread(new WorkerThread(work)).start();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>the start() method will spin off your thread, while your main processor goes back to find more work for threads to do.  You give this thing 10 1 minutes tasks, it'll take around a minute for all those tasks to complete, but it'll take virtually no time for the main processor.</p><p><b>Note!</b> Do not use threads when your task operates on an overall chunk of data.  You want to give threads task that can be done completely independent of each other.</p><p>Not bad eh?  You've got the thing running smokin' fast..  Almost too fast though..  what happens when you get 100 tasks, or 1000 tasks.. or 1,000,000 tasks?!  You're going to run out of resources very fast, and eventually your program will probably throw some Out Of Memory Exceptions.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's not use Threading</b></div><p>You need to manage this stuff so it doesn't <em>spin</em> out of control.  That's where Executors come into play.  Executors manage all of your threads in a thread pool.  The main class you want to use is the ThreadPoolExecutor which has severals parameters in its constructor.  You specify how big your pool is, which type of waiting queue to use, how long to hold onto created threads, and, optionally, can specify a saturation policy.</p><p>It's quite customizable, so it can be confusing at first.  The Executors class is comprized of static methods with commonly used, pre-built ThreadPoolExecutors for ya.</p><p>There's the fixed pool executor, which will hold onto a specific amount of threads and when all those threads are busy it'll queue up the extras.  This is the perfect way to throttle the amount of work going on at once.  Say you have 10 1 minute tasks, but want only 5 people to work on them (budget reasons, probably).  When you get these 10 tasks at once, all 5 will work on the first 5 and when they finish them, they'll grab the next one in the queue.  If you get 1000 tasks, 995 of 'em will go straight to the queue.</p><p>There's also a cached pool executor, which will grow will the work.  It'll create new threads when there's a ton of work, but once things die down, it'll start giving back the resources to keep these threads alive.  meh..  There's not much difference in using a cached pool than starting up all the threads yourself.</p><p>Even though, the fixed pool bottles necks a lot of the work, it'll save system resources and prevent the program from running out of memory.</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ExecutorService exec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>It looks pretty indentical to the previous code.  Now it'll take about 2 minutes to go through those 10 1 minute tasks, but the program won't die when it gets 1,000,000 tasks.</p><div class='title'><b>Customizing the Executor</b></div><p>We can do better than this.</p><p>The workers are happy with their tasks, but the main process is going crazy.  Every little task that comes along will be taken right away and throw in the queue for the workers.  That's not too bad, unless you're doing some sort of transaction service.  If you open up a Transaction everytime you acquireWork, then you'll have 1,000 open transaction waiting to be processed sitting in the queue.</p><p>You could do away with the waiting pool completely, and never have an open task sitting in the queue.  This isn't such a bad idea, but what do you when all your threads are busy, and you give a new task to the executor?  You need a Saturation policy that will tell the executor what to do in this case.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturation Policies</b></div><p>By default, the Executor uses the Abort Policy, which just throws an exception.  Well, we probably don't want to do that.  There are two other ones that are available that aren't so great either:  DiscardPolicy, which will discard the new task, and DiscardOldestPolicy, which will discard the oldest piece of work that a thread is working on.  You defintely don't want to lose work, so discarding is out.  (and) Discarding the oldest piece of work?  You'd get into a cycle of constantly throwing away half worked on tasks.  Nothing would get done except the last remaining pieces of work.</p><p>If we're going to use a saturation policy, then we should use the Caller Runs policy, which uses the main process to execute the newest task when all threads are busy.  Then by the time the main processor finishes a task, the other threads should be ready to receive more work..  hell if not, the main processor can do the next one too.</p><p>This works out pretty well, since when times are busy everyone is jumping in to do the work.  The manager actually lend a helping hand ^_^.</p><p>There's one big problem with this though.  What happens when you have variable task lengths, and the manager ends up getting one that takes far longer to complete than normal?  Everything is held up by that one task, and your performance dips very quickly.  You should really only use this when you have tasks of predictable uniform completion time.</p><p>All of our tasks take 1 minute to complete, so using a Caller Runs policy should be fine.</p><p>I should note that the static Executors method return an ExecutorService, not a ThreadPoolExecutor, which actually have the setRejectionHandler that you use to set the saturation policy.  So you'll need to work around a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>This is pretty good except for one problem..  When you get six pieces of work, the 5 worker threads will get their work and the manager will work on the 6th.  Before the manager finishes task #6, all 5 workers will have finished their tasks, and now must wait for the manager to finish before they can get anything new.  Now you're wasting time again.</p><p>You can solve this by going back and using the waiting queue.  If you have your waiting queue the same size as your thread pool, then in that time when those workers finish their first piece of work, they'll have something new to work on right away.  When the manager finishes up his piece of work, the queue should be empty and ready to receive more work.  Very streamlined.</p><p>Now you'll need to actually make your own ThreadPoolExecutor, rather than using the pre-built one.  I start off by just copying the code from the Executors class and tweaking it a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec =  new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 5,<br/>              0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,<br/>              new LinkedBlockingQueue(5));<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>The LinkedBlockQueue is your waiting pool, and you must set the size in its constructor.I suppose one problem with this setup is.. What if you get 6 tasks, and then another 5 tasks a few seconds later?  Then, by the time the manager finishes up with task #6, the 5 workers will already been done and waiting for work.  Maybe this isn't the best implementation afterall..</p><p>but if you're working with a steady workflow and uniformally timed tasks..  you'll be fine.</p><div class='title'><b>Semaphores</b></div><p>Let's do something else..  Let's not use the Caller Runs policy, and let the manager just manage the workflow.  Instead of having the manager grabbing an extra task that can't be performed on because everyone is busy, we can halt the process until something is available by using a Semaphore.</p><p>A semaphore will have a certain amount of tickets that is acquired by using semaphore.acquire().  If you only give the Semaphore 10 tickets to hand out, you can only run semaphore.acquire() 10 times.  On the 11th time, semaphore.acquire() will wait for a ticket to be returned.  You return tickets be running semaphore.release().</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.  We want our ticket taker before any processing, and then the threads must return the tickets when they're done with their task.<br/><pre>private Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10);</p><p>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      semaphore.acquire();<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work, this));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</p><p>public void releaseSemaphore()<br/>{<br/>   semaphore.release();<br/>}</p><p>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;<br/>   private Manager manager;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work, Manager manager)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>      this.manager = manager;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>      manager.releaseSemaphor();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>Now the manager isn't constantly grabbing tasks when everyone is busy.  The semaphore will let him know when there's space free for a new task.  We don't need to setup a saturation policy, nor a waiting pool size, because with 5 worker threads and 10 tickets, the waiting queue will never exceed 5 tasks.</p><p>This seems like it would work pretty good in all situation.  The main processor isn't held up by anything, the worker threads will always have some work to do.</p><p>Not too shabby..</p><div class='title'><b>Fine-Tuning the Thread Pool</b></div><p>You can still get your processing power performance up just a little bit.  When a thread pool gets a task, it doesn't simply run Thread.start on it.  The task immediately goes into your blocking queue, and threads will take the task out of there to work on.  You have 3 basic types of Block Queues to use.</p><p>The LinkedBlockQueue I've found to be the slowest.  It uses your typical LinkedList setup.  The ArrayBlockingQueue runs faster, by using an Array.</p><p>If you don't plan on having any sort of waiting pool, you should definitely use the SynchronousQueue, which doesn't hold on to your tasks at all.  It passes them to a worker thread right away, without delay.</p><div class='title'><b>There you have it</b></div><p>There you have it..  running concurrent processes will provide you a decent performance gain, but make sure you manage them properly, or else you may be in trouble.</p><p>Never use Thread().start..  Use Executors instead.</p><p>The information was learning through reading the book Java: Concurrency in Practice, written by Brain Goetz with Tim Peierls, Joshua Block, Joseph Bowbeer, Dave Holmes, and Doug Lea.  Definitely check it out for more information of concurrency ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock for Sale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale">Schlock for Sale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, Mitsuwa had their annual Bon Odori Dancing festival.  The Bon festival is typically the festival of the dead that which citizens remember their loved ones.  Nagasaki has a pretty elaborate Bon festival that spans 3 days.  One of the shrines from Suwa Shrine is brought down to the Harbor where it is clearly visible for the spirits to gather and collect amongst the living.  Loved ones can go to the Harbor and see their loved ones who had died over the past year.  On the third day, loved ones light a candle in a little paper boat and send it down the river to guide the spirit through the River Styx.</p><p>Something like that anyways..  This was one festival, I wish I was still over there to see.  Bon festivals take place towards the end of Summer.  Typically sometime between the end of July and the beginning of September.  Nagasaki's Bon festival takes place in the middle of august.  Around the same time, St. Paul, Minnesota also celebrates Nagasaki's Bon festival, since they are "sister cities," which makes it a great excuse to go home and visit my parents.</p><p>Anywho.. Mitsuwa changes this a little bit by adding 'Odori', which is 'to dance.' Mitsuwa's Bon Odori festival was more of the celebration of life, than the remembrance of the dead.

They switched off between traditional japanese stuff, and uninspired contests.  They had Chicago's professional Taiko Drummasters, and Chicago's Okinawan dancers.</p><p>I was really disappointed they didn't have Soran and Yosakoi.  These were the two traditional dances that Maki, Mika, Natchan, and Mayu taught us foreigners.  Perhaps, in one years time, I will assembled a Soran team of my own and bring this time honored tradition to Mitsuwa.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun.  It was really cute to see so many kids having a great time, and it was great seeing everyone in a festival type mood.</p><p>They really need more food vendors and parlor games to bring the essence of a japanese festival to life, though.  I guess too many people have real jobs.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera's Wii Browser Extended API" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/operas-wii-browser-extended-api">Opera's Wii Browser Extended API</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Pretty neat, huh?  This method is new in Acrobat 8.0 and works quite smooth and really isn't too difficult to setup if you have the right equipment.</p><p>Shared Reviews are best used with a webDav server, an online drive that allows both read and write access.  Think of it like a folder on your computer somewhere, except it has a URL location.  The Shared Review will write all the comments made on your PDF to this webDav server in the form of an RSS feed, so whenever a new comment is posted, the tracker system can automatically grab it and apply it everyone reviewing the PDF.</p><p>To do this, first you need a webDav server.  Once you've got one, all the setup is done in Acrobat 8.0.  PDFs must be encrypted in order to initiate any online review.  Acrobat has two main PDF encryptions: Password and Certificate.  Password is pretty much self-explanatory.  You choose a password, and then no one can read the PDF unless they know the password.  Certificate encryption is very smooth, but takes a colossal amount of setup that it's practically not worth it.</p><p>How do you encrypt a PDF with Certificate you might ask anyways?  Well, first off, a certificate encryption is encrypting a document using certificates.  These certificates are the identities of only those you want to view the PDF.  But you can only use certificates you've received from your companions.  If you don't have a certificate for Matt, then you must send out an email through Acrobat asking him for one.  When you receive a full blown certificate from your pal, he will know be one of your 'Trusted Identities' and you can add them into the encryption.</p><p>Anyways, with an encrypted document, you can use the Shared Review option.  You must setup preferences on the location of your webDav server and passwords and such.  You select how you wish to send out invitations of this review.  You select who receive email notifications about the review.  (and then) You select what you want the email message to say.</p><p>Hurrah, all done.  The email either contains a link to the PDF if you have the PDF itself saved on the webDav too, or the PDF will just be an attachment.</p><p>_____</p><p>Pretty neat, huh?  Well the point of this whole post is that I wish to automate this process so Users don't have to put up with all the convoluted steps and instructions written above.  I mean, how can you possibly go through and explain this to everyone that plans on using it.  What a mess..  I doubt anyone actually knows what the hell i'm talking about in the above paragraphs unless you've used Acrobat for online collaboration.  (aside from the fact it's not very well written either.)</p><p>So, I set forth on the internet to figure out how to make a button someone could press, or a file someone could run that would password encrypt a PDF and setup the Shared Review in the correct location and email all the right people.</p><p>Adobe has vast and extensive documentation detailing how to automate this process and automate that process.  "Write this script, Write that script."  "Here's how to make a plug-ins for Acrobat."  "This is pretty nice," i thought.  "I'll have this banged out in no time."  Yeah, not so much.</p><p>You can password encrypt a document using JavaScript, which has been 'fully' flushed out in Acrobat 8.0.  It's been so flushed out now that certain JavaScript functions have different security levels.  So you can't just run any script you want.  Password encryption just happens to fall into the category of untrustworthy.  So, in order to do this, I must write a "trusted" function that does what i want, and then call that.  Trusted functions are those that the User can manually approve of, or live in the Users script folder.  Ugh...</p><p>And, apparently, you can't automate the Shared Review.  I've come across several forum posts across the web asking how to do this, and in each case someone says that it's just not possible.  It's that great..</p><p>I sent an email to an 'expert' who said that "Initiating a shared is much more involved. check out this documents ...." which largely talked about browser-based reviews rather than shared reviews.</p><p>One thing i did find somewhat help was setting the User's preferences for using a webDav server through tinkering with the Installation process.  You can add in your preferences to the .mst file in the folder that contains the setup.exe, which I can't do since people in the office use a CD to install Acrobat.</p><p>Anyways...  i think i'm done ranting about this now..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chicago's Kwik-E Mart" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chicagos-kwik-e-mart">Chicago's Kwik-E Mart</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They had one of their strong-armed employees manning the door, only letting in a certain amount of people at a time.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0001.webp" /></p><p>It's rather interesting seeing so many people showing up for such an obvious marketing gimmick.  Inside housed several shelves of Simpsons merchandise and products emulating products in the Simpsons cartoon.  The most prominent of these real-life Simpsons products at this particular location were those pink dough-nuts and Squishees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0009.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0008.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0008.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0008.webp" /></p><p>The slurpee, i mean, squishee machine was actually suffering from overuse and wasn't properly chilling the contents of my sugar water.  But then had plenty of those cups to fill..  They also had mountains of those dough-nuts.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0002.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0002.webp" /></p><p>Good lord..  Apparently if you bought 25 of these dough-nuts, you'd get a free Kwik-E Mart name badge.</p><p>Unfortunately, the other real-life Simpsons products had been a little too popular.  They were completed sold out of Buzz Cola in a can.  They did have signage up on the fountain drink machine though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0005.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0005.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0005.webp" /></p><p>They only had a very sparse few boxes of Krusty-Os remaining, but in order to keep their stock, added an outragous stipulation of offering them to customers with purchases of $150 or higher.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0010.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0010.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0010.webp" /></p><p>The cashier was complaining to her co-workers about people always asking about them, but they replied, "no, we cannot make a sign about their cost..  something something.."  I'm guessing that this $150 price tag is YMMV.</p><p>The Kwik-E Mart housed plenty of plastic full sized Simpsons characters too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0007.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0007.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0007.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0006.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0006.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0006.webp" /></p><p>All in all, it was pretty fun to see so many people excited about The Simpsons.  It's somewhat ironic to see so many kids there too, who hadn't even been born when this show got its start on Tracey Ullman in 1987, and began airing on its own in 1989.</p><p>I ended up buying a squishee, a dough-nut, and a Radioactive Man comic.  no Krusty-Os or Buzz Cola :/</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0011.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0011.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070729_kwikemart/100_0011.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/13">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/11">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
