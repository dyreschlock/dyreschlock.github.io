| November 18, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>When I came to Japan to work, I had 3 goals for the year.  One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to TEFL Certified" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tefl-certified">TEFL Certified</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 25, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I completed my online certification for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, or TEFL, and I got a fabulous piece of paper saying that much.  Certifications are fine, and all, but they really don't mean a whole lot unless you actually learn something from the course, and can apply that knowledge to your life.</p><div class='title'><b>Goals</b></div><p>I had two reasons for taking this course.  My ultimate goal was to use this knowledge and experience to get a job as an ALT in Japan through the JET Program.  Having a TEFL certificate would help my chances to get the job.</p><p>After applying and interviewing for the position, I felt very inexperienced and novice as a teacher.  So, while having a simple certificate saying I was TEFL certified might help me get the job, and I actually needed the knowledge and experience so I could actually do the job once I got it.</p><p>I looked to this course for guidance, definition, and technique.  And, I really took this course in two parts.</p><div class='title'><b>Taking the Course</b></div><p>For the first lessons, there was plenty of definition.  While it seemed like a lot of obvious information, it was clear and verbose.  There were plenty of questions that I could answer, but never really thought about that much in depth before.  A teacher must be knowledgeable, patient, energetic, adaptive, and a learner.  They must be a manager, organizer, resource, model, and tutor.</p><p>When I made it to Unit 9, that's where technique, lesson planning and execution, was introduced into the course.  And this is also where I stopped for about 4 months.  The JET program had finally accepted me, and I was going to Japan!  When I got to Japan, I was very nervous.  Even though, I had plenty of definition, it's really no substitute for experience or training.</p><p>I fumbled along in classes, but I tried my best.  I made sure to keep eye contact, keep a sharp authoritative voice, be consistent, and be a model for the students.  The definitions I had learned were in my mind, and I tried to stay true to them as best as I could.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>When I finally picked up Unit 9 again, I was absolutely amazed at how useful all the information on lesson planning had become to me.  All the information up to Unit 9 felt very nice to have, and good in theory, but didn't really help me in a concrete way.</p><p>From Unit 9 on, all the planning, and structure helped me build my own lessons for my classes.  It was fantastic.  Most of my initial lesson plans fell a little flat, and didn't really have any flow.  Once I started going through all the Units, my lesson plans became pretty solid, and I felt like the students really took away something in class.  They had fun, and left with a smile. :)</p><p>I feel like I was able to get all 3 things I wanted from this course.  I found plenty of definition in the beginning.  Once I was able to put this course to use, all the techniques I learned were incredibly helpful.  And after completing this course, I have all the answers to go back through whenever I need guidance, and just a reminder on what I should be doing in class.</p><p>So while I got piece of paper that says I'm a TELF certified, I feel I have the confidence and knowledge to back it up, and that's what I needed from this course.</p><p>And, as a final test of that knowledge, I had to write an essay about teaching for a number of available topics.  So, I choose and wrote about the following:</p><div class='title'><b>The Role of a Teacher</b></div><p>The role a teacher plays in the lives of students is significant.  The teacher's role in the classroom is of obvious importance, but the job of a teacher isn't over when class finishes, or when school is over for the day.  A teacher is a teacher all hours of the day, all days of the week.  They are ambassadors of education, and the most important roles for a teacher are to be a manager, an organizer, a resource, a tutor, and a model.</p><p>One of the most important roles a teacher must be is a manager.  A teacher needs to take control of the class, and chart its course for success.  They need to command respect of their students, and let them know they're in charge.  That doesn't mean you must "rule" with an iron fist, though.  Be strict, but be patient, kind, and always listen to your students.  The class isn't about you.  It's about them.  Knowing their needs will make you an effective manager.</p><p>The backing behind an effective manager is being able to organize your class.  A teacher needs to be able to give instructions to their students, and have them able to complete work for themselves.  A teacher needs to keep their students on task and focused on the subject.  And a teacher needs to know how to use the classroom to promote learning of the subject.</p><p>However, a teacher must always be there for their student when they run into a trouble.  As a resource, the teacher is their primary source of material for the course, and should have the ability to answer any question the student has.  This doesn't mean that the teacher needs to know everything.  A good teacher must be a student, too, and always be hungry for knowledge.  They need to have the resources themselves to find out more, and demonstrate that new knowledge to the students.</p><p>As a resource, you help out those most curious, but as a tutor you help out those in need the most.  The role of a tutor promotes trust among the students, and let's them know that no one is left behind.  The teacher will always be there for them, and they can always ask questions.  In a teacher's life, the students must always come first.  It's your mission to see that they all succeed and flourish.</p><p>And lastly, while being a manager holds great importance in the classroom, I think that being a model is the most important role for a teacher.  The students must come first, but holding yourself to the same standard you expect of them should come to a near second.  Students look to you as an example, and you need to provide them with an exemplary one.  A teacher needs to have confidence in themselves, and their knowledge of the subject to be taken seriously.  If you don't have confidence in yourself, then students won't have confidence in you.</p><p>I think it's the most important role because it doesn't end when class or school is over.  Students are around you all the time, so you must be a model citizen, too.  Your behavior in real life must be consistent with your behavior in the classroom, or else the students will lose confidence and faith in you as a person.</p><p>All 5 of these roles build a very well rounded teacher.  A tutor and resource build trust and confidence.  A manager and organizer build respect and structure.  And a model shows them how to use their knowledge and enlighten their lives.  I've been a teacher for 3 months now, and I make sure to inhabit these 5 roles at school and in my daily life.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oktoberfest Label Magnets" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oktoberfest-label-magnets">Oktoberfest Label Magnets</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 18, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last year, I started working on a project inspired by something my little brother was doing at the time.  For each unique Oktoberfest I was able to purchase and drink, I removed the label from the bottle, attached it to a magnet, and stuck it on my fridge.</p><p>I was able to collect 26 labels last year, and here's the result:<br/><a href="/old/v7/beer-label-magnets" title="/beer-label-magnets" title="/beer-label-magnets">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=1006</a></p><p>I started in the middle of September last year, which is pretty late to start collecting Oktoberfests, so I was ready to find all the ones I was missing this year.</p><p>Generally, Oktoberfest Beers start showing up around the middle of August, and by the time October rolls around, everything that's going to be shipped to stores has been shipped.  Many people consider the idea of Oktoberfest beers running out of stock in October (and September being the primary month) rather ironic given the name.  Even Oktoberfest itself in Germany starts in September, and ends a few days into October.</p><p>But, from the brewers standpoint, it really depends on the summer.  The Oktoberfest brewing process begins in March, and the batches are set to ferment over the summer.  And when they're done when they're done.  The true german name (or classification) of the type of beer, Marzen, makes more sense, as Marzen is german for March.  No matter when they're done, the process starts in March (and sometimes April for later batches).</p><p>Last year, I tried to keep my collecting efforts to local breweries, but I expanded this year to include (almost) anything I could find.  And I found a lot of beers that I missed.  Plus, a few that I tried last year that either changed labels, or recipes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp"  /></p><p>There's a sample of the amount of beers I've been drinking over the last 2 months.  I've been driving around to all kinds of liquor stores looking for new beers.  I've been to almost all the ones in Madison.  I went up to Minnesota, and drove around a bit.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Chicago, and a couple other places.</p><p>And the results turned out pretty good.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp"  /></p><p>I doubled the amount of labels on my fridge.  I think there's a total of 52 up there now.  Milwaukee Brewery Company, Berghoff, and Sam Adams had the same beer, but changed the label.  And New Belgium release a Red Hoptoberfest (not that great :( ) compared to the Hoptoberfest they had last year.</p><p>I arranged all the labels in order by my preference, but with so many beers it's pretty subjective.  And at times difficult to remember which ones tasted better than the others.</p><p>Overall, I would say <b>Sam Adams Oktoberfest</b> is a good middle ground, mediocre Oktoberfest to judge the others on.  Anything better than Sam Adams is a good, tasty Oktoberfest, in my opinion.  When I compare, I usually start there.  If it's better, than I compare it to <b>Leinie's Oktoberfest</b>.  And from there, the process gets a little cloudy.  If it tastes similar to another one on my list, I usually place it next to (or near it).</p><p>By FAR! my favorite beer from this year is the <b>Three Floyds Munsterfest</b>.  It is incredibly smooth, with a deep rustic, autumn feel.  It's not as flavorful or deliberate as the Staghorn, but pretty damn perfect for what I look for in an Oktoberfest. Very similar to Lake Front.</p><p>Also, I had a chance to try <b>Ayinger Oktoberfest</b> which is the first German import Oktoberfest I actually liked.  I think I put it too low on my list, and will have to adjust it next year when I have more opportunities to try it again.</p><p>With the exception of Ayinger, one thing I really don't understand is why all German imported Oktoberfests taste like stale rotten Heineken piss.  They are the absolute worst beers I've had.  And they all taste very similar, so it's gotta be similar to what the Germans actually drink over there, right?  Ayinger rises above that, but still has a tinge of the Heineken taste in it.  I don't understand it.  And maybe the only way to answer this question is to actually go to Germany for Oktoberfest sometime.</p><p>Overall, I found every Oktoberfest I was looking except for one.  I really really want to try <b>Wiehanstefaner Fest Bier</b>.  Wiehanstefaner is my favorite German brewery, and I would imagine their Oktoberfest has got to be pretty good.  Hopefully that will lead me to more answers to why German Fest Biers are horrible and gross.</p><div class='title'><b>Makin' Magnets!</b></div><p>Anyway, making these magnets are pretty easy.  I outlined the process in the previous post, but I'll reiterate it here.</p><p>To remove the label, I use Wine Appeals's Wine Label Removal Kit.<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3">http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O</a></p><p>It's basically just tape that you cover the beer label with.  When you remove the tape, the label will come off with it.</p><p>And then I'm using Super 77 spray adhesive on ProMAG's Paintable Magnetic Vinyl Sheets.  I spray down the sheet, place the labels on top of the sheet, let it dry for a little bit, and then cut them out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Pain in the Ass!</b></div><p>Most of the time, the labels come off very easily, but the label for <b>Flying Dog's Dogtoberfest</b> does not!

We went to the ocean, climbed some hills in his town, Eugene, and drove up to Portland a few times to take a look at some places.  On one of those trips to Portland, on the best most clearest day, we continued east in the direction of Mt Hood, Oregon's tallest mountain.</p><p>The Timberline Lodge is a national historic landmark and operating ski lodge on the southern slope of the mountain.  It's the highest occupied point of the mountain.  To get any further up the mountain, you'll have to go by foot, or by chair lift and then by foot.</p><p>On clear days, and in some areas of Portland, Mt. Hood is like a distant shadow.  It looms over the east, but it doesn't tower or demand the skyline.  It's like a powerful icon. </p><p>Out of Portland, we took the most direct route to Timberline.  Hwy 212 to Hwy 26.  Mt. Hood was always in our view as we continued our trek.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" /></p><p>As the mountain grew and grew the temperature began to decline and the snow acculation became greater and greater.  It was 60 or 65 degrees back in Portland, but it was 40 degrees when we finally made it to Timberline.  It's amazing to think that it was Spring a mere 60 miles away.  As we turned on the road leading directly up to the Timberline Lodge, it was so icey that we had to pull over and engage our 4 wheel drive.</p><p>But!

The building has its own restaurant, common area, bar, and rooms for the guests.  It probably has living quarters for some of the staff, too.  Though, I suppose commuting everyday wouldn't be too difficult.  It only took us an hour and a half from downtown Portland.  But, they'd probably need something for the staff if they were snowed in.

One interesting factoid I remember is that American automotive companies used to have a constant about whose cars could make it to Government Camp from Portland the fastest (or at all) in the middle of January.  It usually took the cars a whole month to make the journey and a lot of the time the cars would get completely stuck or couldn't even make it over the terrain.  The teams would use horses to pull the car along or over whatever horrible obstacles they came across.</p><p>The museum also detailed plenty of expeditions to the peak of Mt. Hood, and displayed the original gear of these mountain climbers.  Most of the outfits were made of heavy cloth, and had plenty of rips and tears from the climb itself.  Googles were scratched, and you could barely see out of them.  It's like looking at our space shuttles and wondering how the hell we ever used these things to get anywhere.</p><p>Down the street is the Ice Axe Grill, home to the <a href="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/" title="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/" title="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/">Mt. Hood Brewing Company</a>.  Even though this quaint little mountain town probably feels isolated from the rest of society, and especially when it snows 5 or 10 or 20 feet at a time, there's plenty of beer to go around.</p><p>It would be nice to live in such an isolated place.  Away from the constant distraction of a flourishing city, but I think the tranquil isolation would eventually become boring.  And I'm sure very little ever changes out there.  Those types of places probably feel like they live outside of time.</p><p>Anywho, Mt. Hood is beautiful, and it's fantastic how close it is to Portland.  I'd like to see how it looks over the summer, and actually get the chance to walk along some trails, and be able to see the mountain itself rather than just from the road.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pacific Ocean" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pacific-ocean">Pacific Ocean</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The areas we were looking for were Devil's Churn, Cooks Chasm, Thor's Well, and a couple other natural formation of the ocean smashing into the rocky coast.  We stopped at the Visitor's Center to get a map, and a general idea of where these places might be.</p><p>We tried to find Thor's Well first, but it was a little difficult since it wasn't marked on any maps.

I bought a Rice Cooker, a gigantic pan, and the ingredients.  And it really was just that easy.  Vegetables first, add eggs, add rice, add soy sauce.</p><p>It's pretty much my "go-to" meal in the kitchen, and over the past 10 years I've come up with some good combinations of ingredients and sauces that compliment each other pretty well.  I started experimenting with some new ingredients over the past few months, and the results have turned out pretty well.</p><p><b>Squash</b> (particularly Acorn Squash) seasoned with a little honey and pepper makes for a bold flavor all around.  Fried <b>tomatoes</b> add a rich earthy, flavored tone to the mix.  And <b>cucumbers</b> are damn refreshing in almost everything you mix them with.  So, I decided to mix all 3 together and see what would happen.</p><div class='title'><b>Ingredients</b></div><p>Overall Ingredients include rice, eggs, tomato, cucumber, acorn squash, onion, and red pepper.  Along with a little butter, some balsamic vinegar, some honey, pepper, oil (in this case canola oil), and soy sauce.  For soy sauce, I'm using a combination of the citrus stuff, Ponzu, and some organic brand.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp"  /></p><p>Before doing any of the cooking, we need to prepare the rice, and the squash.</p><p>Overall, the amount of ingredients I'm going to use should feed about <b>4 people</b>, or 2 super hungry people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rice Preparation</b></div><p>The rice is pretty damn easy.  I used 2 cups of rice this time since I was cooking for more than just me.  Be sure to wash the rice thoroughly to remove any dust and dirt that has collecting in the bag.  Clean rice gives a totally pure taste.  If you don't wash your rice, it ends up tasting somewhat muddy, and tainted.</p><p>Anyway, 2 cups of rice, add the proper amount of water, and shove that into your rice cooker.  It usually takes about 40 minutes.  Rice cookers are pretty nice.  Most modern rice cookers will automatically switch to a warming mode, so you can keep your rice sitting in there for almost a day later.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp"  /></p><p>I've had my rice cooker since studying abroad in Japan, and I have found it VASTY superior to any western/American made one I've had in the past.  Most American models are designed to make 5+ cups of rice at once, but totally fail if you want to make a single cup of rice.  You can find a lot of the Japanese models on Amazon, totally in English, if you're interested in getting a really good one.</p><p>Here's the exact model I have, but in English : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24" title="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24" title="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24">Sanyo ECJ-S35K</a></p><p>Or, you can just skip the rice cookers, and make rice the old fashion way with a pot on the stove.  But rice turns out perfect every time with mine, even after 5 years.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Acorn Squash Preparation</b></div><p>For Acorn Squash, I prefer baking them.</p><p><b>1. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees</b>, and actually WAIT for it to get to 400 degrees.  Usually, I just turn it to 400 degrees and then throw them in there, but the low heat will quickly dry out the insides of the squash.  It must be exposed to the full heat in order for it to actually cook, and turn out perfectly.</p><div class='title'><b>2. Cut your Squash straight down the middle.</b></div><p><b>3. Remove all the seeds</b> with a spoon, and, basically, hollow it out.  You could save the seeds, and cook them separately if you like. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp"  /></p><p><b>4. Coat the exposed areas with some butter.</b> The butter is mostly used to keep the surface of the squash from drying out too quickly before it actually starts cooking.  The flavor is a nice touch, but there are probably slightly healthier options.</p><p><b>5.

The sole reason behind this move was that my little sister and her husband purchased Packer tickets for themselves, my dad, and me for their game on Christmas Day.  They are pretty big sports fans, and love going to live events, sporting or otherwise.</p><p>In the past few years, they've brought me to a Badgers game, and a Twins game.  The Badgers game had a huge amount of fans, but no drinking at all.  The Twins game had plenty of drinking, but didn't really have the same level of fandom that Wisconsin brings to its game.  The Packers game had both.  There was massive amounts of drinking, and an incredible level of fandom.  I'm not really into football that much, and I'm even less into the Packers, but it's hard not to get into the game and root for the home team when you're completed immersed.</p><p>I took some pictures.</p><div class='title'><b>"Tailgating"</b></div><p>The game took place at 7:20pm on Sunday.

I thought it'd be pretty hilarious if they lost, but after the crowd continued to erupt in cheers and support for the Packers whenever they did well, it was far more entertaining and fun cheering on the Packers as they defeated the Bears.
