| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Carlos Ulloa is seasoned developer. He grew to be a lead developer at Psygnosis during the mid-90s before they were completely absorbed by Sony in 1999. Carlos went on to do Flash development with several advertising companies until he eventually started his own company built on Flash that came off the ground with Papervision 3d.</p><p>Carlos and his pals are responsible for creating this wonderful open source Flash library which makes 3d development in Flash quite understandable and easy for those familar with using 3d tools such as Maya and 3ds max, and easy for those that know Flash too.</p><p>Let me say.. I accomplished another one of my life goals that day when I shook the hand of a man responsible for Wipeout XL and Wipeout 3. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Realtime v. Pre-rendered</b></div><p>Interaction is the base of an engaging experience. These are the moments that make a User's experience unique. You engage a medium and that results in a reward. In other terms, interaction will result in content. To make an engaging experience you must use input to render an output in realtime. That's where we're at today.</p><p>A Realtime experience is active, responsive, flexible, customizable, and different every time. It's exciting compared to the previous step in motion graphics: Prerendered movies or pictures. A prerendered experience is passive, unresponsive, rigid, static, and repetitive. Overall, it's boring. You want to make something unique, and video games has really been at the cutting edge of making a unique experience.</p><p>Video Games lead computing innovation both in Hardware and Software. As video games began to mature we saw the advent of Full Motion video. CD-Roms were developed to hold this full-motion video as floppy disks simply could not contain that amount of data.</p><p>Realtime 3d was next. The Playstation revolutionized gaming designing their hardware specifically for rendering 3d imagery on the fly. Once 3d took the gaming world by storm, Prerendered movies were a thing of the past. "Skip Intro" began a coined phrase in most games.</p><p>Throughout the past 12 years of the Playstation, we're finally getting to the point where prerendered backgrounds ARE a thing of the past. Realtime rendered 3d can look just as good as any prerendered intro sequence, so most games don't even do them anymore. These two paths of motion graphics are finally converging to a single point.</p><div class='title'><b>The Web</b></div><p>Interactivity of the Internet is lead by Flash development. Flash player 9 in the standard of internet gaming with new features such as ActionScript 3, multi-threading, optimized rendering, and full screen modes that don't degrade your flash file. Flash has a very healthy open source community that is by flash developers, for flash developers.</p><p>That's like another 'duh' statement, isn't it? What he means by a flash open source community by devs for devs, is that most Flash open source projects are entirely independent. Many other open source community for other programming languages can be heavily commercialized with their funding provided by certain companies pushing their open source product.</p><p>At this point he unveiled his own open source project, Papervision 3d. Papervision 3d is an open source realtime 3d engine for Flash. It supports ActionScript versions 2 and 3. It is extremely powerful in terms of performance, flexibility, and expandability. It's very easy to use since ActionScript 3 has made many strides in ease as well. It has built-in Asset management. (and) Papervision also uses COLLADA which will allow you to import your models and textures from Maya, 3ds Max and other 3d programs.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Practices</b></div><p>Carlos went on to describe how development is changing with the current trends of motion graphics. The old model of software development is very time-line.. this is where you start off Designing everything. During the design phase you begin production. Production would be.. i dunno. I don't quite remember. Once you're done designing, then you begin developing, and once you're done developing that when the artists come in and make up the prerender video to fill in the gaps between levels.</p><p>This process doesn't seem very efficient at all.. It doesn't really make much sense to me either :/.. Next up he unveiled how the trends will shape this software development model.</p><p>Designing and developing will start from the very beginning. Production will still take part in the middle, however development will last throughout the whole time-line. Once Design ends, the artists will take control and work with the developers up through the end.</p><p>His whole point from these development models is that artists are becoming essential to the development of your game. You need artists creating models and levels, while your development team is working on the engine and physics. Both need to flow together to make an cohesive experience.</p><div class='title'><b>Budgeting</b></div><p>He continued on to discuss how budgeting for games have been to see a renaissance. Last generation, Art would find itself taking up 50% of the budget, with 30% for design and 20% for development. With 3d development, you needed people creating all the 3d models in the game, the levels, and making up for lack of technology like lighting effects. Artists had their work cut out for them to make 3d look believable..</p><p>These days, development is on the rise again. We have the technology to build renderable engines to make shadows and lighting effects look very believable without clever texturing tricks. Development, Design, and Art will grow to have an equal slice of the budget pie.</p><div class='title'><b>Use of 3d</b></div><p>Next, Carlos went on to describe the 4 most common uses of 3d in any medium.</p><p><i>Transitions</i> are moving from one 2d space to another through 3d.<br/><i>Navigation</i> is moving around a 3d space until arriving at a 2d space.<br/><i>Exploration</i> is moving around in 3d.<br/><i>Customization</i> is changing textures on 3d objects.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next for Papervision?</b></div><p>For the next version of papervision there are trying to include Full environments and skeletons. Full environments would include composition and camera work, compared to using the one-camera-centric stage that Flash begins with. With skeletons, they're looking at including Inverse Kinematics or Motion Capture for movement of human models. Also ASCOLLADA to import skeletons and animations from Maya and 3ds Max.</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>To conclude, he discussed where he gets his inspiration from. Games can inspire you into making a game, menu, or UI. Demos can inspire you into Special Effects. Motion Graphics can inspire composition and camera work. (and) Film and TV can inspire classic film making concepts. All these concepts are vital to creating 3d, so don't be adverse to sampling everything out there.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I thought this was a great presentation, but it really wasn't in my field of work. Papervision is a very powerful tool and hopefully more Flash developers will begin to adopt it so we can see more amazing things in the future ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day One" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one">Adobe Max Day One</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Earlier this week, my company and I went down to Chicago to attend Adobe Max, adobe's premiere conference discussing all things Adobe.  I've been to plenty of conventions before, but this would be my second work-related one.</p><p>This conference was huge.  Attended by 4300 people, across 60 or 70 sessions 4 or 5 times a day.  They packed so much information into this 3 day event, there's no way even a couple people could experience it all.  On the third my brain was so fired from constantly spinning and collecting information, I really needed a day to collect my thoughts and get everything down on 'paper'.</p><p>It was a fantastic time, though.  We stayed at the Chicago Hilton at night.  In the morning, they rented out big busses to shuttle people back and forth between their hotel and the convention center that held Max.</p><p>Breakfast was the first event of the day and was massively attended.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" /></p><p>One thing Adobe did expertly well was provide a very vegetarian based meal.  It was great, nearly all their entrees and food was 100% vegetarian, so us non-meat eaters had plenty to eat.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0533.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0533.webp" /></p><p>After breakfast, was the first general session of the conference.  Some of us waited in line, but I went around to the Max Store to see if they had anything good.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0538.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0538.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0538.webp" /></p><p>Not really...  they only thing of interest were these Adobe Mugs with all the new icons.  Only $15!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0535.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0535.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0535.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0534.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0534.webp" /></p><p>The AIR bus was also parked over near the Max Store..  That whole area was designated the AIR Park, and had some developers giving demos of their AIR apps, and a survey counter for free stuff.  They also had a few improptu sessions pop up over there.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0546.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0546.webp" /></p><p>Another general hang-out location was the community pavilion which housed around 100 vendors pushing their products and information about how Adobe worked great for them.</p><p>Very playful atmosphere, in the midst of work ^_^</p><p>Sessions I attended on Day One were:<br/><a href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch" title="/adobe-max-day-one-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">General Session Keynote by Kevin Lynch</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-hands-on-deploying-flex-and-htmljavascript-applications-to-air" title="/adobe-max-day-one-hands-on-deploying-flex-and-htmljavascript-applications-to-air">Hands on: Deploying Flex and HTML/JavaScript Applications to Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR)</a> by Jeff Tapper<br/><a href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-online-ads-that-attract" title="/adobe-max-day-one-online-ads-that-attract">Online Ads that Attract</a> by Eric Natzke<br/><a href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-effective-website-redesign" title="/adobe-max-day-one-effective-website-redesign">Effective Website Redesign</a> by Neil Straghalis<br/><a href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-blitz-case-study-creativity-conducted" title="/adobe-max-day-one-blitz-case-study-creativity-conducted">BLITZ Case Study: Creativity Conducted</a> by BLITZ Team<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Case Study: Creativity Conducted" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-blitz-case-study-creativity-conducted">Adobe Max - Case Study: Creativity Conducted</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Creativity Conducted, or Holographic Flash Projections with WiiMotes Deconstructed was lead by team BLITZ.  A company that is world-renowned for developing interactive advertising campaigns, rich internet applications and user interfaces.  So world-renowned, in fact, that they don't even have a wikipedia article....</p><p>This talk was lead by co-founders Ivan Todorov and Ken Martin as they discussed the trials and tribulations of developing the Creativity Conducted interactive WiiMote display at the Adobe Max party on Tuesday Night.</p><p>Going into this session, I really had no idea what they were going to talk about.  The title had the word WiiMote in it, so that shot my interest all the way up, but the description didn't say what they were using them for, or how they were using them, or what the hell was going on.  I thought that they may have been using these things with Flash or something..</p><p>What it was: BLITZ had built this massive 16 foot by 9 foot widescreen display that you can paint the timeline of Adobe onto using a WiiMote, and this session was discussing how they went about doing that.</p><div class='title'><b>Concept</b></div><p>Adobe approaches BLITZ and asks them to develop a big ass display for their Adobe Max Event.  The theme of the event is 3 decades of Adobe, so incorporate that in your product.</p><p>Ken Martin took the stage and discussed how they came up with the concept.  Adobe reaches out to everyone..  Nearly everyone on the planet has used an Adobe product in their life, and maybe not even realizing it..  I mean, if you've seen a YouTube video, you've used an Adobe product as YouTube videos use the Flash player.  Big to small, everyone has been touched by Adobe.</p><p>But how do you incorporate the creativity used with Adobe into a Chronology sequence.  Typically, the word Chronological implies "bored off your ass".  Time-lines are very static and full of information..  How can we make this fun?</p><p><em>Interaction</em><br/>Well, letting the User interact with the time-line is a good start.  Adding dynamic components to a very static concept is always a step in the right direction.</p><p><em>Paintbrushes</em><br/>Let the User paint their own time-line of events.  As the time-line becomes full of life, events in Adobe's lifetime will begin to tell their own story and begin to grow with the User's composition.</p><p><em>Save and Share</em><br/>Part of making a beautiful art piece is showing it off to the world.  Being able to save this image was a key feature to this project that needed to be included from the start.</p><div class='title'><b>Finding technology</b></div><p>So we want interaction..  Interaction how?  Everyone can use a mouse, but that's boring to do for a massive display.  Trackballs are great for a display as well, but how can someone paint with a track ball?  Being able to gesture the paint strokes would be great but we'd need a tool..</p><p>Why not the WiiMote?  With a swoosh of your hand, you'll be able to paint onto the screen, like you were conducting a symphony.  WiiMote are easy to find as well, we could add in a multiplayer component to this composition to make it very interactive and physical.</p><p>Now that we've got our input device, how are we going to make the thing?  Martin explained that they wanted to build this thing with 100% Adobe driven development.  The application will be made in Flash 9, using some open source Flash products.</p><p><a href="http://wiiflash.org/" title="http://wiiflash.org/">Wii Flash</a>: To interpret the bluetooth signals from the WiiMote.<br/><a href="http://www.papervision3d.org/" title="http://www.papervision3d.org/">Papervision 3D</a> For developing 3D graphics with flash.<br/><a href="http://bytearray.org/" title="http://bytearray.org/">Export to JPG</a>: To export the final composition to JPG.</p><p>Now:  How are we going to display this thing?  They wanted something big!  Something and in widescreen format.  Hell, why not 16 feet by 9 feet?  That's pretty easy to measure.  They ended up making the display with a DIY projector, a mesh fabric background, and a dimly lit room.</p><div class='title'><b>User Experience</b></div><p>This display is all about the User.  What are our goals when developing this User's experience and how do we want them to interact with the display?</p><p><em>Intuitive and Simple</em><br/>They want something very simple the User could pick up and play right away.  This meant simple instructions, and a very easy interact that didn't take much for the User to feel at home and ready to create.</p><p><em>Animated Brushes</em><br/>Let their design bloom.  When a User makes a stroke, the painting should bloom and come alive..  kind of like when you use very course paper, the strokes bleed into the page and it feels alive.</p><p><em>Illustrators</em><br/>To create these animated brushes, BLITZ hired 5 illustrators to design 5 different styles independently from each other from the 3 decades of adobe (the 80s, 90s, and 00s).</p><p>Since BLITZ would have 5 independent illustrations, they needed to design a plug-and-play importing system for their application to add and swap these brushes at will.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Flash for WiiMotes</b></div><p>With all the concepts covered for the project, Martin handed the mic over to Todorov to talk about Implementation.</p><p>The primary challenge with using the WiiMote is that the values it emits are mostly relative to it's position.  It knows the pitch, acceleration, and points relative to the IR sensor bar..  BUT the WiiMote does not know it's exact position on the screen.  Your application must interpret that data and figure out where's it's pointing.</p><p>Besides screen location, they also wanted to utilize distance to and from the screen to draw depth into the image.  On screen, that's where using Papervision was key.  Papervision is wonderful for 3D developers because their models can be directly imported from 3ds max or Maya.</p><p>Another challenge that cropped up with how to actually paint?  The WiiMote knew what buttons were being pressed, but how would they tell Flash about the depresses?  They used a Virtual Mouse program to reprogram their computer to use the WiiMote buttons as mouse clicks.</p><p><em>Pleasant Expectations</em><br/>Some things did go precisely as planned.  Adding a second WiiMote into the mix was dirt simple.  Using open source technologies through bytearray.org were great.  Papervision is fricken awesome.</p><p><em>Pleasant Surprises</em><br/>Throughout the course of development, they were surprised a few things.  Flash Player 9 is damn fast..  They were able to push and push the new flash player with very minimal lag.  Also, the WiiFlash community is very healthy.  Any problems that came up with WiiFlash were easily resolved with the help of the community.  And they even gave back by finding some bugs too.</p><p><em>Unpleasant Surprises</em><br/>With any project, you'll come across things that are a pain in the ass.  Limitations with the WiiMote were very annoying, as they can't interpret depth as well as they'd like.  You have a limited range you can use a WiiMote, and when you break that distance, it'll think you're pointing off screen.  Also, all their vector imagery had to be converted into rasterized images when outputting on screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>Once Todorov was done talking about Flash, Martin came back on stage to talk about creating the display they were going to use for this thing.  They needed a really fricken bright lens in their projector for a 16 foot by 9 foot display, so they went through several different bulbs before finding something bright enough.  The lens had 10,000 Lumens, for those that know whatever that means.</p><p>Google Sketch-up was incredibly helpful for placing everything into space.  It was good to see of sketch of how far the user will be from the screen relative to the size of the screen, and the placement of the IR sensor bar, and all that.</p><p>And he went through other boring construction type stuff that I didn't take notes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This session was pretty fun.  It was neat the see the creation of a very non-conventional piece of interactivity using state-of-the-art and very current technologies.  Always think outside the box ^_^.</p><p>Was it practical for me?  Not really.. I suck at flash.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Effective Website Redesign" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-effective-website-redesign">Adobe Max - Effective Website Redesign</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Neil Straghalis is one of the major players for the web team at Adobe.com. He has lead Seve website redesigns in the past years, and in this session he discusses what he has found to be the best techniques and design practices when redesigning a major website.</p><div class='title'><b>Strategy</b></div><p>He first asks.. Why? Why redesign your website? I mean, if something isn't broken, doen't fix it, right? Times change.. styles change, focus changes.. everything changes, and you must keep current. If you have a stale design, people will notice right away as being outdated, old.. You want to be on the cutting edge. Live in next year... not this year, and definitely not last year.</p><p>When you redesign your site, think about your goals. First off, have a goal in the first place.. You want to redesign your site because ______. Once you have your goal, make sure your entire team knows this goal. This is why we're redesigning the site, so keep this in mind with everything you do. Divide this goal into sub goals.. What are you business goals? What are your client's goals? What are your design goals?</p><p>Being goal oriented will make it easy to figure out where you are in the design process and if you correct in making your decisions. Basic software engineering stuff.. Have you list of requirements and adhere to it absolutely.</p><p>Another bit of strategy is Data or Content. Now that you have your goals, what content do you really need and what can you ditch. Do you really need a detailed account of Adobe's History on the front page of Adobe.com? Do you really need it on the site at all? If so, where should it go so it's not in the way of pushing your product line?</p><div class='title'><b>Redesign v. Reskin</b></div><p>When redesigning your site.. do you really need to completely overall the entire thing? Maybe a fresh coat of paint will accomplish your goals.</p><p>Skinning is an easy way to design what you already have in a different way. If the company changes focus from a family friendly environment to something with a more business oriented approach, switching out the graphics and redoing the CSS would probably be the best result, if they didn't want the content to change at all.</p><p>If skinning just won't do, then you should keep a few things in mind.. First off, What are you redesigning? What doesn't work with the site?.. What does work with the site? Also, define the scope of your redesign. Are you completely redoing all the pages of the entire site, or just the front couple of pages? Back to content and data.. what do you need? what don't you need?</p><p>Another thing you may not think about is Priority. What do you want the User to see on your site? What isn't so important on your site that you shouldn't spend too much time on?</p><p>Remember that the overall goal of a redesign is to make your site as good or better than the previous version, so if something simply isn't working, maybe you should rethink your decision and revisit your previous version.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Once you've developed your goals, and begun to form an idea of your redesign.. Design it! Start drawing mock-ups and coding prototypes. As you start building your website keep a few things in mind...</p><p><i>Build with a redesign in mind</i><br/>You're already begun to build your website, but experience tells us that everything can and will change. You will be redesigning what you're working on now, so build this new design with that in mind. Don't make things difficult for you in the future.</p><p><i>Generic Naming</i><br/>Part of that is naming things generic. You want to clearly label your CSS classes and ID tags so you have a general idea of what they do, and then reuse them all over your site. Don't be too specific or you'll get bogged down with thousands of IDs that you just cannot maintain.</p><p><i>Semantic Markup</i><br/>Speaking of CSS, Use it! Use it alot. This is rather obvious. CSS is there to make designing, skinning and the web experience as editable and customizable as possible. If you aren't using CSS, then you have fallen way behind of the times.</p><p><i>Separate Presentation from Content</i><br/>Build templates, and reuse CSS and JavaScript. Don't put too many details into each of your pages when you have an entire sites to build. Templates are a great way of reusing code throughout the site. When making a single change to your site, you don't want to make that change in a thousand places.</p><div class='title'><b>Design and Develop</b></div><p>Now we've gotten to the fun part ^_^. Bringing your design to life with all you have. Again.. be sure to use CSS, Templates, and Shared Assets. Shared Assets meaning.. use the same images, javascript files throughout the site rather than making them page specific. Reduce and Reuse!</p><p>Other methods of re-development can be Scripting, Find and Replace, Hand Coding, Application code updates, and XML... duh, right? The whole concept of a redesign is to generalize everything, but sometimes you do need a little bit of Hand Coding on a single page..</p><div class='title'><b>Adobe Developer Connection</b></div><p>At this point, Straghalis went through the steps his team took with Adobe.com and merging the Macromedia together. Currently his team is working on redesigning the current Adobe.com into something very customizable and personal to the User.</p><div class='title'><b>Summary</b></div><p>So.. to summarize, ask yourself Why redesign? When you know why you're redesigning, ask yourself What are you redesigning? When you know the scope, start doing something prototypes, and ALWAYS build with a redesign in mind.</p><p>Then once you're done, it's time for vacation!</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I thought this was a great presentation full of rich practical information that really does work. Most of this stuff is rather obvious, but sometimes you just need to be reminded of it in a very organized way. ^_^ Great stuff.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Online Ads that Attract" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-online-ads-that-attract">Adobe Max - Online Ads that Attract</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The title of the session was a bit misleading, as we didn't touch Flex what-so-ever.  The session was all about getting started using AIR and writing an AIR application using simple HTML and JavaScript.</p><p>This session was lead by Jeff Tapper, a web consultant with clients including Harley Davidson, Toys R Us, IBM, Dow Jones, American Express, and so forth.  He is an Adobe certified instructor teaching about Flex, ColdFusion, and Flash.  He's also written and edited a few books too, including <em>Flex 2: Training from the Source</em> and <em>OO Programming with ActionScript 2.0</em>.  This guy has quite a bit of credentials, but he apologized that this session really didn't do anything with Flex.</p><p>Since this was a Hands On session, the room was full of PCs ready for messin' with.  Tapper lead us through 5 examples he had setup and ready to go.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" /></p><p>Even though this was the first session I had attended at MAX, the focus of this whole conference was very clear: AIR.  AIR is an acronym for Adobe's Integrated Runtime environment.  It's their desktop VM you can run Adobe's web based programming languages against.  It's rather revolutionary really.. being able to develop and deploy desktop applications with your knowledge of web development is quite an idea.</p><p>I was quite excited to dive into this stuff since it had been crammed down my throat all morning.  I mean, how do you do this stuff?</p><p>All the computers were setup with <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a>, an Eclipse based IDE specifically developed for AIR development, which is free for download on <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana's Website</a>.  You just create a new project, type out some HTML and some Javascript and BAM.. you've got an AIR app.</p><p>The five examples he brought us through were <b>Copy and Paste</b>, <b>Drag and Drop</b>, <b>Network Connectability</b>, and two others I don't really remember.  This was all done in JavaScript calling methods from the AIR API.  Pretty slick stuff.</p><p>Again, check out <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a> and play around with it for yourself. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day 1 Keynote by Kevin Lynch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">Adobe Max Day 1 Keynote by Kevin Lynch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After breakfast on the first morning of Adobe Max, Kevin Lynch came in front of the 4300 participants and talked about all things Adobe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0541.webp" /></p><p>This is one of the most self centered, self promoting keynote speeches I've ever listened to..  In fact, it really wasn't a keynote at all..  It was an hour and a half long commercial about Adobe, about MAX, and about what you can do with Adobe.  Kevin Lynch traded off with several other developers and designers who would give a run down of what was new with their product or how Adobe was the perfect solution for them.</p><p>There was one piece of technology that was very exciting out of all this.  That was that flash now supports the H.264 HD video format.  So, now you can publish video in flash up to 1080p and it will work seemlessly across multiple platforms that support the H.264 format, like Flash Player 9 on the web, mobile phones, TVs, and the Playstation 3.</p><p>One of the presenters Lynch brought up on a stage did have some useful information we all could use.  He discussed 5 ways to give you User a great experience with your product.</p><div class='title'><b>Content is King</b></div><p>Websites should not prevent the User from getting at what they want.  They are at the website to view content..  Your design must be subtle and helpful for the User to achieve their goals as effortlessly as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Make it Personal</b></div><p>Adding that personal touch for the User will make them feel more at home and provide an atmosphere that is efficient for them.  This involves skinning and customability of design and workflow for your website.</p><div class='title'><b>Less is (still) more</b></div><p>This goes back to the idea of being subtle.  Your design should not get in the way of the User and should accent the User's experience, not inhibit.</p><div class='title'><b>Movement has meaning</b></div><p>Add movement and animation to transitions between navigation.  What the User feel like they are actually moving through the UI rather than just one page to the next.  This gives a sense of depth into the content and provides the User with information of what they've done to reach their current destination.</p><div class='title'><b>Create an Experience, not a UI.</b></div><p>Pulling all these concepts together will give the User a unique experience that will stay with them and will keep them coming back and bringing other Users to your site.  The Internet is the most interactive medium the average person has at their finger tips, so WOW them.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 35W Destruction" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/35w-destruction">35W Destruction</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I really needed to get up to UW-Eau Claire and retrieve my bowling ball, which was in my little brother's possession, and while together, we decided to go the extra couple of driving hours to reach Minneapolis.</p><p>Today on the way, we stopped off in downtown Minneapolis and took a look at something I didn't get around to doing when I was home last time.  I think that was around 2 months ago.</p><p>We took a look at what was left of the 35W bridge that had collapsed into the Mississippi River on that July Thursday evening around 6pm.</p><p>Parallel to the 35W bridge is another bridge about 200 feet away that connects part of the yuppie downtown area to dinkeyville and the UofM on the other side of the river.  We ended up parking a block or two away from the north foot of that bridge in the fraternity sector of campus and begin to make our way south along the bridge overlooking the disaster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" /></p><p>Here's the northern foot of 35W, collapsed into a train yard.  Those two train cars were udderly crushed from the weight of the bridge and its rush hour inhabitants.  Here's a closeup:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" /></p><p>There were two very large chunks of the bridge still left for disposal.  The closest chunk used to lay atop one of the shelves at the base of the river.  When I first saw this chunk, i thought, "jesus.. no wonder this crappy bridge feel apart."  Honestly, that bridge has got to be the most brittle construction job ever done.</p><p>It looks like 35W was nothing but a thin slap of concrete stretching all the way across the Mississippi being held up by a couple steel beems balancing on 3 or 4 raised shelves.  This bridge should've been torn down years ago and replaced..  I guess time did that for them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" /></p><p>Further down, all the metal beems that linked itself to this whole chunk were absolutely warped, crushed, bent, squished, etc..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" /></p><p>In the river, another team was worked on pulling part of the bridge emerged in the water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" /></p><p>and further on in that picture is that other most solid chunk left of the wreckage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" /></p><p>It's really bizarre to think that a heavily used highway was there only 2 months ago.

| September 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, my work day was spent using POI HSSF, which can read and write Excel spreadsheets in Java.  You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Salmon Fried Rice" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/salmon-fried-rice">Salmon Fried Rice</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Break that succulent salmon apart into a million tiny pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0429.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0429.webp" /></p><p>Once the salmon starts to cook a bit, plop on two eggs.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0430.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0430.webp" /></p><p>Then start swishing around everything together.  Be sure to completely mix and combine both ingredients as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" /></p><p>Then comes the rice.

Put a very very tiny bit of the sauce over the top of your concoction.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" /></p><p>Like all previous steps, mix mix mix.

The hint of butter.. the hint of soy sauce.. all wrapped around the superb taste of the divine fish.</p><p>This recipe is extremely basic, but the taste of extraordinary..  Of course, it's the salmon that brings this fantastic taste to the table in the first place.  Unfortunately, it is a very basic bi-product of the salmon, so it's difficult to focus this as the center of your dinner.  Some green beans on the side would act as a brilliant compliment to this outstanding meal.</p><p>Give it a try if you have some $50 fish sitting around the house ^_^.</p><p><em>PS: The images might not show up in an RSS reader because I turned off hot-linking from my site.
