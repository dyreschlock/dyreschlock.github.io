| April 11, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, Madison's newest Japanese Restaurant, Takumi, opened its' doors to the public:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" /></p><p>Takumi is located on the east-side of Madison, right next to the Half-Price books, Noodles and Milios.</p><p>We arrived around 8pm, and walked right on in and were greeted by the waitressing staff, "irashaimase. ^_^"  That really threw me back for a second...  All the other Japanese restaurants I've been in Madison, have been very American in their service; however, none can really be compared to hearing "irashaimase" when you walk in the door.</p><p>Irashaimase is one of the most polite ways of saying, "welcome to our store" in Japanese.  If you enter any retail store in Japan, you'll hear the closest clerk to you say it.  (and) Then it has a domino effect throughout the rest of the employees of the store.  It reminds me of the 6 story 100-en store in Hamanomachi in Nagasaki (which is now closed when i went there over spring break).  If you perch yourself on the 3rd floor near the circling staircase and a new customer walks in, you'll hear, "Irashaimase" start on the 1st floor and trickled up by each of the clerks to the top floor.  It's very surreal.</p><p>Anyways, The place itself was very quaint. The had a bar, a sushi bar, a couple tables, and Tea Rooms towards the back.  We probably should've taken the Tea Room option, but went with the standard table.  We sat down and took a look at the menu.  Takumi primarily focuses on Sushi.  3 or 4 pages of their 8 page menu feature different entrees, combos, and single items.  The also had some hibachi, donburi, and bento.  We all ordered something different: Matt went with the hibachi, Leif and Steph went with a bento, I ordered sushi, and Zach also ordered sushi.</p><p>Takumi also had full Japanese sized beers in the favored Japan Brands: Asahi, Sapporo, and Kirin.</p><p>First, they brought us a sampler of their Ginger Salmon dish...  It was decent tasting, though the ginger was very overpowering.  It tasted like a standard Chinese American dish.  I suppose they were probably testing out their recipes, or something..</p><p>Next, they brought us our soups and salads and then came the main course.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" /></p><p>I've never had better Sushi in my life.  The California Rolls were somewhat standard, but the Sashimi..  my god.  The salmon was full of flavor, full of meat, full of color..  so good.  The tuna was also fantastic, as was miscellaneous fish on the end.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" /></p><p>Leif and Steph's tempura bento was also quite tasty, as was Matt's salmon hibachi.  Takumi can definitely do fish.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Definitely better tasting than Ginza and Edo.</p><p>Though, with 2 beers, the tricolor entree, and a side of fried rice, my bill came out to $37.35..  The Tricolor Entree was about half the bill..  Beers were the other chunk..  Sushi is not without its cost.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fried Spaghetti Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fried-spaghetti-recipe">Fried Spaghetti Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>howdy all..  for the last month and half i decided to work on a recipe that came up while i was in Japan.  One day, when shopping at the dinner discount grocery store, i came across some spaghetti noodles.  Oh baby, i hadn't had spaghetti in such a long time.  That's what's for dinner tonight!  I picked up a couple boxes, some spices, and went on my merry way.</p><p>At home though, all i had was a frying pan.  I didn't have a strainer or a big 'ol or any of the usual instruments.  My frying pan was kinda deep, so i figured i could just use that and then drain out the water somehow.  I started frying up the noodles and something amazing happened.  All the water in teh pan either boiled off or was absorbed by the noodles..  All that was left in the pan were the noodles, and i used this opportunity to fry them a little bit for the ultimate taste.  I chucked some cheese on them at the same time, and it was the most delicious spaghetti i had ever tasted..</p><p>Once i got back and started cooking again, and sought to perfect this recipe..  Although it's not quite perfect, i think i'm done eating this fatty spaghetti recipe..  i've gained about 15 lbs. in the past 2 months :/  blech.  That's also because i sit down all day now and then watch tv at night.</p><p>Anywho..  on with the recipe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" /></p><p>here's the ingredients i've been using: some spaghetti noodles, olive oil, a bag of lettuce, some shredded cheese, parmesan cheese, delicious spaghetti sauce, delicious alfredo sauce, and some spices such as garlic and organo.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" /></p><p class='img'>Start off by putting some Olive oil in the pan.

| March 6, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, i was testing some ordering processes at work and needed a Credit Card to continue.  I filled out all the fields with random characters to see if i could get with that, but no..  I went through the code to check out the validation and there are 3 things that must be true in order for a Credit Card to be valid before it even considers processing.  One of these things was just that it wasn't expired, but the other 2 dealt with the number itself.</p><p>Since i was inputting a VISA card, the number had to follow a few conventions.  It had to be either 13 or 16 digits long, and had to start with a 4.  Our processing software has a bunch of other card types as well, each with their own conventions specifying the length of the number, and the first couple digits prefixing the number.</p><p>The real interesting requirement was the number had to follow the Luhn Formula, which i later looked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">wikipedia</a>.  The Luhn Formula states that when you double every other number starting from the end up the digit sequence and then add all the digits together, their sum is divisible by 10.</p><p>So...</p><p>If you have a some random number sequence: a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6</p><p>Double every other digit starting from the back: 2(a1) a2 2(a3) a4 2(a5) a6</p><p>Add them all together:  2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6</p><p>They should be divisble by 10:  (2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6) % 10 = 0 (formula 1)</p><p>Moving some things around we'd get this formula if the number of digits are even: ( 2(a(1..n odd)) + a(2..n even) ) % 10 = 0</p><p>So....  this is how i needed to derive my fake Visa number to continue along the ordering process.  I began using the conventions defined with the card type, so that gave me this template: 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.</p><p>Since we take every other digits, let's split up the variables a little bit: 4xyx yxyx yxyx yxyx.</p><p>Plugging this number into our formula, gives us ( 2(4 + 7y) + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 8 + 14y + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 4 + 7y + 4x ) % 5 = 0 (formula 2)</p><p>That 7 is rather annoying, but we've already hit prime with the 5, so you can't really reduce it much further.  Luckily it's in a cute little formula that we could just plug in numbers to find something simple..  This is, of course, if we wanted all x to be the same and all y to be the same.  Otherwise formula 2 would be formula 1.</p><p>Anywho.. looking at formula 2 for a few seconds may give you an answer.  if y = 1 and x = 1, it succeeds.  I've got my fake Visa number 4111 1111 1111 1111, but you could go the easy route and have y = 0 and find x = 4, or x = 0 and find y = 3.</p><p>I suppose it would've been easily if i kept my number as 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.  Then i would've found ( 4 + 11x ) % 5 = 0, and found x = 1 very quickly..  or that i could use x = 6 too.</p><p>After looking into this stuff, i've realized just how insecure this whole system is. It's pretty easy to make up a fake Visa number, but taking a look at that wikipedia article, the Luhn Formula is not meant for encryption, just validation.  Just a little housekeeping, so someone doesn't screw up and type a 5 rather than a 6 and still get a valid number.  This is used for all credit card numbers too, so if you're bored why not double check your Visa number to see if its valid.</p><p>Math is everywhere ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-3">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><b>Java 6 Features</b> w/ Venkat Subranium</p><p>On this third day of christmas I started of in Venkat's Java 6 features talk, which was rather enlightening.  He talked about how Java 6 has integrated the use of scripting languages into the java language and how scripting languages can use the java libraries on their own.  You can also pull in script files into your java code, run them, and play around with the results of the run code.</p><p>Something that peeked my curiosity a little more was the next feature he talked about: instantiated an instance of the compiler and being able to compile and run new code at runtime.  That's freakin' awesome.  You could do some pretty fun AI functionality by setting up some program that would write, compile and run code all on its own.  I think about having just a simple Body class sitting on a server somewhere.  It doesn't have much... just one method that takes in a filepath.  I'll send that sucker an Arm class..  The body reads and runs that Arm class and instantly makes it its own.  Pretty handy.</p><p>Eventually if you quite giving more intelligent body parts it might be able to start writing up code for making its own limbs and the code monster keeps growing...  Then the terminator would come back through time to kill me.</p><p><b>Advanced Selenium</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>Anywho...  the next panel I went to was Selenium which was also pretty slick.  Even though we use Selenium at work, i never really knew what it was about.  I thought it was just some JavaScript testing tool...  but i guess i got that backwards.  Selenium is a testing tool written in JavaScript.  You can, or write Java code to, fill out table information representing actions taken to traverse your website.  Stuff like..  fill in User text field with 'NameString', click on login, click on this and that, buy this, logout, all the while sticking in several asserts to make sure your system is doing what you want.</p><p>This is a fantastic way to test your webframe work.  Just input all your Use cases into Selenium, hit play, and it'll return all the infractions of your Use cases for you.  Huzzah..  No need to run through everything on your own.</p><p>You could also setup Selenium to run a bunch of macros that will get your within your system quicker..</p><p><b>Expert Panel</b> @ Lunch</p><p>After lunch was the expert panel discussion, which had 8 or 9 speakers take questions from the crowd.  The question of 'how should students be taught programming basics and lore when there are so many modern day languages and tools that remove the need to explicitly know about them?' was posed.  Problems are posed when teaching students only Java as language, because then they know nothing of garbage collection and memory leaks.  Problems are posed when teaching students a loosely typed language, because then type know nothing of type casting and such.  Where do teachers begin the learning process, yet still get them up to speed with the technologies of today.</p><p>Everyone on the panel said their peace about their thoughts..  Certainly, the consensus was don't tie them down to one language and CERTAINLY don't tie them down to one platform.  No one language is infinite.  One quote from the weekend was, "Don't think of software as gold bars sitting in a vault..  Software is more like lettuce.  If you let it sit, it will degrade and rot away.. "  This is true with all technologies in this field.  You have to keep current to be a valued member of this industry or else you'll be structurally unemployed sooner than you think.</p><p>This really extends further to almost all industries..  All industries evolve..</p><p>As an addendum, they added, that that's not to say forget about the past..  You don't need to know how to write code at the byte code level, but you should definitely know how that byte level code is used.  You should know the inner workings of the constructs you are building on.  Computers aren't MAGIC..  they are technological devices built on technologies built on technologies..  If you don't know how the technologies you are using as a foundation, then you have no business building on them.</p><p>Another topic brought up during this time was open source technologies with the slogan, "get your ass out there and help out"  Open source communities are the main driver's for developing these technologies, not just creators of the technologies..  The communities are the ones that pick up the left over parts, fix bugs and clean up the code which shapes and completes the projects..  Even if you needed a selfish reason to work on something, think of the scenario of coming into a job interview and being able to say that you worked on that open source technology that that company is currently using.  Dump that on your resume.</p><p><b>Reflection</b> w/ Ted</p><p>After such stirring lunch conversation, the sessions started up again.  I attended Ted ___'s guide to reflection.  Reflection is basically making an object that is the representation of a class.  This object has all the methods and fields, but this is not an instantiation of the class itself.  With reflection you can actual get to private data and methods..  Which is handy in some instances..</p><p>This is also how annotations are utilized.  When you grab the class, you can get the annotations from that class and process that information.  huzzah.  This was a repeat of Venkat's annotation talk the previous morning.</p><p><b>10 Ways to Improve your code</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>stuff to come...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-2">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This whole conference seems to be very Jave development oriented and  showcases several brilliant developers of Java and Java-like technologies.  There is also a huge focus on thw web services side of Java development,  which makes this conference right up my own alley, as well as, Widen's alley.</p><p>It's pretty much like any convention except the people speaking are actual experts rather than amatuer fans of the product.  Case in point, the three speakers I attended today were actually developers of the framework they showcased.  David Gaery showcased JSF, Venkat Subramaniam showcased Grails, and Scott Davis showcased Atom, though Davis isn't really responsible for Atom.  It is really amazing to listen to these heavyweights of the Java community talk about their passion.</p><p>Atom certainly caught my eye today, but what i'm really shopping around for is a web framework I can use and implement for theschlock.com.</p><p>JSF was kinda fun, but it felt rather heavy duty for what I wish to accomplish.  Grails is simply amazing, but it seemed difficult to customize.</p><p>What I want to do with theschlock.com is quite simply.  I want to make it a navigatable portfolio of all my old art and other random crations i've had over the years.  An end all resource of all the crap I've done.</p><p>I want to use one of these crazy new technologies because it'll give me the experience of playing around with something new and cool, as well as demonstrate my proficency of applying said technology.</p><p>After thinking about a few things though: what I want to do is quite simply.  A ton of entries sorted by date and possibly by category.  This is easily accomplished using technologies i've been using for the past couple of years.  Hell, just build a javascript 'database' type file and have page javascript load and render all those elements and huzzah..  i've got my website.  :shrugs: I guess I could do it that way.  why make things more complicated then they have to be.</p><p>Maybe i'll just search for a technology to develop a beautiful photo navigator for all the 15,000 pictures i've taken over these last four years.</p><p>Anyways, Grails is pretty amazing.  I wouldn't mind playing around with that.  Much like its' initial model: rails, it utilizes Convention over Configuration, which means you do everything a specific way rather than write up a bunch of config files to tell he framework what the hell you are doing.  This type of framework lends itself extremely well to Agile development, since you can write code fast, rather than spending time configuring everything.</p><p>The highlight of the evening was Scott Davis' keynote speach, which confronted the question of choice...  basically.</p><p>ugh...  I'm typing this up on my phone and getting rather bored.  i'll finish this up later.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Vista work around" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/vista-work-around">Vista work around</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

However, i couldn't find the product key for Vista, so after a day or two, Vista started complaining that my copy wasn't Genuine. How dare they insult my intentions!</p><p>When such things occur, they give you 3 options. You could quit and go back to the login screen, buy a product key from Microsoft directly, or you can operate in a reduced functionality mode of Windows. If you click on the reduced functionality option, it'll open up IE 7.0, and allow you to browse the web to buy a key online, or something like that.</p><p>Well, Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer are pretty much the same piece of bread, I figured.  I typed in 'c:/' as my URL, and what d'ya know! It opened up Windows Explorer. That's pretty funny. Now, I was able to watch movies and stuff while waiting for a product key.</p><p>Hey wait a minute... If i can still open up programs in reduced functionality mode, I should also be able to... I browsed to my c:/windows/ directory, and clicked on explorer.exe.  Sure enough, it opened up a fully functions windows. Interesting.</p><p>So, if Vista complains about your copy not being genuine, just file browse to Windows and open up Windows manually.</p><p>Of course, you still have that non-minimizable and non-closable window complaining about your disingenuous copy of Windows. That scoundrel! But, you can just move that to a corner of your desktop.</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before Microsoft patches this up.</p><p>PS: I'm sure this has already been posted somewheres on the internet a thousand times by now.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shining" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shining">Shining</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is the third attempt for the US Treasurery to get rid of the paper dollar and use something a bit more solid.  With good cause too.  According to <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/5853746.html" title="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/5853746.html">this article</a> the average life span of a dollar bill is about 2 years.  The dollar bill is a frail piece of paper that get used over and over and over again.  The bills are torn apart during their lifetime, and must be replaced.  Any coin pretty much lasts forever.</p><p>I wonder why the dollar coin hadn't worked before.  Maybe it's because it wasn't widely adopted so those with a dollar coin couldn't use it in it's most convience places, like vending machines and parking meters.  There's also the psychological barrier of switching something so standard in our lives.</p><p>Well, i think about how money is generally used in Japan.  Over there, they have coin currency up to 500 yen, or $5.  Their standard lowest paper money is the 1000 yen note, or $10 bill.  You'd think having more coins, would mean having more change to lug around all day long, but it's quite the opposite.  When your coins have more value, you keep track of them a little better because of their worth, but also because you're using these coins whenever you pay for something.  If you buy something for 425, you'll be reaching in your pocket for a 500 coin anyways, why not grab all your change and whiddle the excess down at the same time.</p><p>After we ran our food stand at the festival, we sold our tacos for 250 yen.  An easy 3 coin purchase.  So..  after we had our profits it was almost all coin.  I changed up all the coinage for bills with my own money.  I ended up having so many coins i couldn't even carry.  But, each day i would grab a hand full, and stuff my little coin pouch and attempted to see what i could get rid of.</p><p>Very few places in Japan take credit card..

Adults usually work all day, and Kids are usually at school all day.  Even when they aren't at their places of business or work, they usually aren't home.  The Japanese usually conglomerate somewhere in the town, rather than each other's homes.  Therefore, they need something to keep them connected with all their friends and business associates.  This is why cell phones are so grand in Japan.  If you don't have one, then you must be tied to a phone somewhere or a computer somewhere to keep in contact with your friends to figure out what's up.  You'd be stuck in your tiny apartment or house waiting for something to happen, rather than walking around the town getting something done.  This is also why the Japanese people leap until mobile technology faster than in the US.</p><p>The Japanese use their cell phone as their primary communications device.  More Japanese connect to the Internet through their phone, than on a computer, and more Japanese send emails back and forth from their phone, rather than calling each other.  Whether on a train, on a bus, or just walking, you can easily see most pedestrians typing away with one hand on their cellphone.</p><p>Since cellphones are so widely used, the market for making phones is probably the largest technological market in Japan.  If you walk into any electronic department store, you'll be bombarded with their cellphone area almost right away.  There are 3 main cellphone companies in Japan: DoCoMo, Soft Bank, and Au.  Their stand-alone stores are almost just as common as convenience stores.</p><p>The phone company i went with was Soft Bank, and purely because of their options.  I was looking for a prepaid phone, so that limited my choices to Au and Soft Bank right away.  Now these companies don't have prepaid only models.  They have prepaid plans that can go on specific models.  These plans usually nerf all but a few options for the phone.  The prepaid plan for the Au phones nerf almost all the options, and only allow the user to email other Au users.  The prepaid plan for Soft bank phones pretty much did the same, except allowed emailing to any email address.  Well that narrowed down the choices pretty fast.  So i got a slick looking Soft Bank phone.</p><p>Anywho...  each store has a vast variety of different cellphones you can choose from.  Some vary in options, but every single cellphone is complete with the internet, emailing, and an infrared sensor.  Most phones have cameras, and most phones have marginally large hard-drives for playing mp3s.  Another such model actually has an antenna  for catching TV receptions.</p><p>Whenever you come across some poster advertisement in Japan, you'll probably notice a square barcode like design printed with it.  Well, that's just one of the many uses of the infrared sensor.  You can set the sensor to capture, and point your phone at this barcode.  The barcode acts as a URL when it's received by your phone, and will automatically bring you to a website from the advertisement.</p><p>McDonalds makes full use of this technology by stamping one on each of it's product's wrappers.  You can scan the wrapper's barcode, and it'll bring you to a webpage detailing the nutritional information of what you're eating.  pretty handy.</p><p>The other main use of the infrared sensor is to send contact information back and forth between other cellphones.  This skips the whole process of asking what someone's phone number is, and then tediously typing it into your phone.  The sender can just send the info across infrared and the receiver can capture this information effortlessly.</p><p>In Japan, my cellphone and a pocket map were my two main pieces of equipment (besides id and money) in order to get around and do things without being tied down to anywhere.</p><p>___</p><p>In contrast, American phones are so damned primitive.  It's like beating two rocks together to make fire.  Of course, we don't need anything so helpful in our society because we're usually home.  You could just call their house.  With cellphones, in America, now you can call the person directly, but you wouldn't want to email said person, because they are more than likely driving around since everything is so far apart.  Internet?  That's what computers are for.</p><p>As bitched about before, American cellphones annoy me.  Though, despite being annoyed by my own phone on occasion, the auspicious Cingular 8525, it actually acts as a very nice Japanese phone, even though it's not cool looking and somewhat heavy.  It can do internet and email just fine, but the one thing i played with last night has sold me on it. (even though, i already bought and paid for it)</p><p>The 8525 actually has one of these infrared sensors on it, so i wondered if my American phone could talk with my Japanese phone.  An interesting experiment, indeed.  I turned on my Japanese phone and sent a contact over through infrared...  huzzah. My American phone captured the information and actually noticed it was a Contact..  It didn't decipher the 'title' of the contact correctly, but all the other information was intact.  I'm actually rather impressed..  I moved most of my Japanese contacts over to my phone in a matter of 20 minutes.  It took about a minute per contact.  Though, it doesn't allow me to enter detailed contact information about myself into the phone without listing myself as a Contact :/  oh well..</p><p>Now my next fun experiment shall be if the 8525 can read Japanese cellphone barcodes and make sense of them...<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/15">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/13">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
