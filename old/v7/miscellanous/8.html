The place was called <b>Oysy</b> and is located where Tumbleweed used to be.  Yes, that disgusting unappetizing restaurant went out of business, thank god.  And now we have a Sushi buffet?  We definitely got the better end of the deal on that one.  Since Dave was in town on Friday, he and I went to try it out.</p><p>They certainly had a rather large selection of foods.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp"  /></p><p>They had crab legs, chicken teriyaki shish-kabobs, salmon, shrimp, tempura shrimp, tempura brocolli, tempura squash, kalamari, octopus, frog legs, prawns, oysters, and so on....</p><p>The salmon wasn't too bad, and the tempura shrimp and veggies were great.  I didn't try many other seafood selections, but I probably should have.  They had edamame there, too, but Dave informed me it was unsalted.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5514.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5515.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5516.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5516.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5516.webp"  /></p><p>The bulk of what I ate was their sushi.  It was pretty decent, though it wasn't gourmet by any means.  It tasted identical to the sushi you can find at Copps, actually.  They had plenty of sushi chefs on staff preparing it and putting it out immediately.  But again, the quality is nothing compared to what you'll find at Takumi or Sushi Muramoto.</p><p>They had plenty of Japanese beers, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp"  /></p><p>Their buffet was the only food item on the menu, and for a $20 entry fee, the price is a little steep.  If you're going to dine for Japanese tonight, I would definitely recommend any other Japanese restaurant in Madison.  Takumi and Sushi Muramoto are absolutely delicious for Sushi, and Ginza and Takara are fantastic too with a more well-rounded menu.</p><p>I don't want to bash on the place because I love Japanese food and it's great to see a new restaurant open that isn't just Sushi or Teppanyaki and has more variety, but...  you can do better.</p><p>I really wish a Ramen restaurant would open in Madison or somewhere nearby.  The closest and only one I know of is in Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights, Chicago.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to I love Ramen!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/i-love-ramen">I love Ramen!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Out of all the foods in the world, Ramen stands as one of my top 5 favorites.  I love the stuff.  It's an entire full meal in itself.  The noodle are the main "meaty" course.  The broth provides an excellent complementary base for the noodles.  And there's little bits of veggies, eggs or meat for variety.</p><p>Though, it wasn't until a year or so into college, when I first stepped into the Asian Market in Minneapolis, that I became such a Ramen freak.  Previously, I had consumed the crappy Maruchan stuff found in grocers.  But when came upon the vast selection of the Asian Market, I was utterly stunned.  An entire aisle, filled both sides full of almost one hundred different kinds of Ramen.  My senses were momentarily overloaded.  I figured they would have more selection and better quality Ramen, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p><p>I did the only logical thing I could think of.  I bought one of every different brand and flavor they had.  The store clerk wasn't very happy when I set a few hand-baskets full of single packs on his counter full Ramen that were all different.  $50 bought me two months worth of food!</p><p>With each and every Ramen pack I made, I wrote down my thoughts on my blog, and scored each one.  It was my quest to figure out which was the best Ramen of them all.  Throughout those 2 months, which was actually closer to 3 or 4 since I didn't eat Ramen every single day, I worked my way through some pretty mediocre products.  You can find most of these reviews in my archives, somewhere around 2003.</p><p>I did eventually find the two best kinds of Instant Ramen ever made..  but I had learned a lot along the way.  What makes the best Ramen?  How does cost factor into the decision?  What sort of things added to the Ramen really bring out the taste?  What else can I do with Ramen outside of the simple instructions?</p><div class='title'><b>Ode to Ramen, collage</b></div><p>For every pack of Ramen I ate, I kept the packaging.  I laid the package on my desk, and placed several books on top to flatten them.  After I completed my task of finding the best Ramen, I created a collage of my journey.</p><p>Though, I guess as an Ode to Finding the best Ramen, it doesn't really work at all.  But it does show the frantic over-sensitized decision I had to originally make when I found myself in the Ramen aisle.  So many choices!  Which one is it?!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp"  /></p><p>By the way, the Answer can be found in the lower left hand side, <b>Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun</b> (which is Korean and may no longer exist), and on the left hand side, <b>Mama's Tomyun Shrimp</b> (which is Thai and can be found at Copps).</p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen</b></div><p>Of course, none of those can compare to actual Ramen in Japan.  And especially Hakata Ramen found on the streets of Fukuoka, Japan after night fall.  I ate a shit load of Ramen with studying abroad in Nagasaki, Japan.  Some from franchises, some from street vendors, and even some new Instant flavors I hadn't tried before.</p><p>When deciding on a topic for my "final" history project, I lept at the chance to cover Ramen.  And I did so in the form of verse.  Thanks to links on Wikipedia and general Google searching, finding enough information to form a timeline was pretty easy.  Though, I still ended up at the local Internet Cafe quite late, trying to pull everything together.</p><p>I wrote my script, and rocked the microphone hard!!  Here ya go!</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing"><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen - 5 min 42 sec</b></a></p><p>If I knew piano, I would probably re-record this lovable "poem" with a nice beat.  "Dr. Suess' Ramen Piano Bar Remix"  Maybe someday in the future.</p><p>This was recorded near the end of 2006.  Unfortunately, just 5 days into January 2007, the creator of Instant Ramen, <b>Momofuku Ando</b>, went to that big Cup 'o Noodle in the sky at age 96.  Ninety-fucking-six!  Ando truly proves that Ramen is the secret to a long and full life. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics</b></div><p><em>The is the history of instant noodles or Ramen<br/>A food product which is quite

I finished around the same time as previously, but just a little bit quicker.  In the Madison Half Marathon, I finished at 2 hours 50 minutes, but it was probably closer to <b>2 hours 48 minutes</b>, as it took 2 minutes to cross the starting line.  I finished the Madison Mini Marathon is <b>2 hours 45 minutes</b>.  And today, I finished the Fox Cities Marathon is <b>2 hours 43 minutes</b>.</p><p>After finishing my first Half Marathon, I wrote about why I <a href="/old/v7/run-run-run" title="/run-run-run">decided to Run</a>. Spoiler! I saw the movie, Run Fatboy Run, and thought it looked pretty easy.  And it wasn't too difficult.  That first half marathon beat the shit out of me, but it gave me perspective and motivation for fitness.</p><div class='title'><b>Motivation</b></div><p>Motivation is the reason I signed up for another 2 Half Marathon right after finishing the first.  Motivation to continue running on my own and exercise regularly.  Overall, I run to lose weight and keep fit.  I like to be light on my feet.  But running builds Motivation of its own.  The energy spent and built while running keeps the body in motion throughout the day.  It eases my lazy tendencies and lightens my mood.  The cycle of exercise and motivation to exercise is just as powerful as the cycle to sit there and not exercise.</p><p>During a marathon, that motivation is far greater because you're surrounded by thousands of other people that have the motivation to get out of bed on very early weekend morning and run for a few hours as the sunrises.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" /></p><p>Everyone is there for different reasons, but those reasons give them the same motivation that guides their feat across the pavement and eventually across the finish line.

He recanting a story of a 30 year old came through the ER having a diebetic episode.  He did not know he had diebetis, because he couldn't afford Health Insurance.

This preacher talked about how his parents are great Americans, who've played by the "rules" the entire life.  They had great jobs, and supported the economy all these years.  But...  they worked for GM.  And because of the recession, GM would no longer provide extensive healthcare for their employees.</p><p>You may have great healthcare now, but what happens when those that provide it to you can no longer afford to do so?  He had always thought that there were two kinds of Americans..  those with healthcare, and those without.

And how the other senators in Wisconsin don't know what they're doing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4667.webp"  /></p><p>"What do we want?"

It's a treasure trove, but at a cost!</p><p>So that's probably why they still have so many copies of these games.  Why buy a $50 PS2 game that full of pussy Japanese bullshit, when I can buy a badass FPS for the Xbox 360 for only $10 more?!  Riddle me that, civilian!</p><p>Anyways, as you can see in these pictures, they don't have just a few copies of these games in stock.  They have a whole bunch of copies.  And it's not just this PX too.  When Justin was stationed in North Carolina, I picked up copies of Devil Summoner 1 and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne.  Both of which are Atlus published (and developed) games.</p><p>I find it really odd that these military posts have such a huge surplus of these games.  And!  That no one on-base buys any of them.  You'd think the rules of Supply and Demand would be enforced here, but they aren't.  The next time I return to Florida to visit Justin, there will be just as many Atlus games as there were on this trip.  It's really odd.</p><p>They need to put all their Atlus titles on sale or clearance or something.  Hopefully when they do, it'll be the same weekend I'm down there.  My half.com store will have a glut of fantastic games, again!</p><div class='title'><b>Not just Atlus</b></div><p>Atlus is the most prominently published games, but there are plenty of other unappreciated titles on those shelves.</p><p>There were copies of Okami, God Hand, Soul Nomad, and Rhapsody.  There were copies of other NIS games, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp"  /></p><p>If you happen to know someone in our Armed Forces, visit them and take a look at the video game stock at their PX.

| June 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday morning last week, I got up bright and early, like I do every day.  Except today was different.  I took the day off work.  Instead of waiting for the bus in front of my apartment building, I went down the block and got on a different bus.  One that took me over to my local At&amp;t where, 11 days prior, I had paid for my new cell phone!</p><p>My new cell phone is the fancy iPhone 3GS, which At&amp;t had opened its doors early for.  I was 5th in line when I arrived and 40 minutes later, I walked out of the door with my new phone.</p><div class='title'><b>My previous phone</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp"  /></p><p>For the last 2 1/2 years, I've been using the 8525.  After careful research and comparisons which I blogged about here (<a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars">Jan 23rd, 2007</a>) and here (<a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars-part-2" title="/cellular-wars-part-2">Feb 5th, 2007</a>), I bought this phone because it could do Japanese and was compatible with Japan's cellular signals.</p><p>This was the first cellphone and cellphone contract I've ever done!  I was excited and had a lot of fun with it...  at first.  But as time went on, the 8525 degraded and felt apart like a cheap pencil.  These days, I can't hold a conversation longer than 1.5 hours without the fully charged battery dying.  Windows Mobile 5 crashes all the damn time.  And it is very slow when doing the simplest of Internet tasks.</p><p>Ever since my contract had run its 2 year course, I could not wait to get rid of that piece of shit.  We had some good times, but some things in life just aren't meant to last.  We all knew that the 3rd generation iPhone was coming out sometime this Summer.  So, I was patient.  I needed only to wait.  And 2 weeks ago, Apple finally announced that it would coming the Friday after next.</p><div class='title'><b>iPhone 3GS</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp"  /></p><p>Friday finally arrived, and with it brought my iPhone.  That general fancy-gadget excitement had returned!  I felt just as anxious and optimistic when I first got my 8525.  Not only do I have a fancy new phone, but I actually have an iPod now.  All these years, I've still been buying and using CDs like a caveman.  In fact, the reason I've been slacking off on blogging again was because I spent last week ripping all my CDs and importing them in iTunes.  I was preparing!</p><p>After my first 5 days with this thing, I love it.  It blows my previous phone out of the water and does so much more.  Much like when I first got the 8525, I feel like I'm carrying around a little personal computer.  Most everything I do on the Internet, can be done on the iPhone.  So if I'm away for the weekend, I can easily keep up with News or whatever without clunking around my laptop.</p><p>The iPhone isn't the only fancy phone on the market these days.  Palm released its <b>Palm Pre</b> about a month ago.  The Palm Pre is a little amazing piece of technology of its own.  It's every bit good as the iPhone...  except there is one thing that the Palm Pre <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely</span> does not have.</p><div class='title'><b>Video games</b></div><p>Thanks to the overwhelming market share, the iPhone has started becoming a contender in the game market.  Game Developers are actually starting to take it seriously, to an extent.  The larger developer studios mostly see it as a quick way to make some money, like with <b>Metal Gear Solid Touch</b> and <b>I Love Katamari</b>.</p><p>But some PC studios have released their full fledged games on the iPhone, like Gameloft with <b>Oregon Trail</b> and Popcap Games with <b>Peggle</b> and a few others.</p><p>Not only that, but in the next few months, we'll see the release of the <b>Dexter</b> iPhone game.  Which will be the first "high" budget, full-fledged released iPhone game.  In the game, you carefully stalk your victims, building a case as to why they should killed.  You justify their murders, kidnap them, and justify your decision to their face.  If you correctly uphold the law of Harry, and don't get caught or let your guard down, you win.</p><p>The Dexter iPhone game had an impressive showing at E3 where many journalists compared it to the Phoenix Wright series on the DS.  That should come out in July.</p><p>But anyways, I've been having a great time with the games I have so far.  Here are the games I've bought so far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp"  /></p><p>The reason I started off with these games was that I wanted to see what established console and PC developers were trying to do with the iPhone.

| May 26, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About 3 months ago, I saw a movie entitled <b>Run Fat Boy Run</b> starring and written by Simon Pegg and also written by Michael Ian Black.</p><p>Simon Pegg's character is slightly depressed and had gained a bit of weight since he left he fiance at the alter five years ago.  Now his fiance is dating Hank Azaria who is one of those guys that is good at everything.  Hank Azaria is fit and healthy and plans to run the London Marathon is a couple of months.  Not to be out done by the likes of him, Simon Pegg vows to run the marathon, too.</p><p>The "comedy" of this movie is how a lazy dude like Simon Pegg gets in shape for the marathon.  And the "development" of his character is what he learns on the way.  His friends are supportive and pitch in to point Simon Pegg back on the healthy track of life.</p><p>Overall, I thought the movie used a lot of tired jokes, relied too much on physical humor and wasn't very original.  One thing was very clear in the movie, though.  For Simon Pegg, running the marathon would ultimately solved all his problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Hmmm...  solved all his problems, eh?</b></div><p>Maybe I'm a little too impressionable by movies and video games, but the cogs of thought started spinning around in my head.</p><p>First off, distances on foot really don't intimidate me.  While living in Japan, I walked up the side of a mountain almost everyday to get to school.  Also, when the bus sees fit to leave downtown without me, I've walked the 3.5 miles to work without a problem.</p><p>Ok, 26 miles is kinda far, but a 13 mile half marathon?  I could easily traverse that.</p><p>Secondly, I need some manor of exercise in my life.  Walking everywhere is nice, but it's no where near a full workout.  DDR is too inconvenient at my apartment and there are no machines nearby.  I don't really like biking.  I like running around the neighborhood, but I lack the motivation.</p><p>I figure that signing up for a marathon would give me the motivation to stick with a regular routine of running/jogging and provide some actually exercise in my life.</p><p>Those 2 reasons were why I signed up for the Madison Half Marathon.  It sounded easy and would get me to exercise.  To clinch my dedication to the race, I asked Dave if he'd run the marathon with me.  He's also looking for excuses to exercise.</p><p>We estimated our finish time at <b>3 hours 1 second</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Training</b></div><p>In Run Fat Boy Run, Simon Pegg has 3 months to get in shape before the London Full Marathon.  My time was a little bit shorter than that.  I had 9 weeks after I signed up.  That really didn't bother me though.  I wasn't going to delude myself into thinking that I could keep a running pace during the entire thing.  I was quite certain that I would be walking the better part of the race.</p><p>That was pretty much my pace during training.  Run run run until I ran out of breath, walk until I caught my breath, then run run run again.  On, off, on off.  Every time I went jogging, my initial run would get longer and longer.  My goal was to get to the point where I'd be able to make it through the entire course without walking.  I was able to run nearly 75% of my 1.5 mile course before I expanded it to 3.4 miles.</p><p>Run run run.  I got slightly better each time.  A minute faster here, a minute faster there.</p><p>Previously I gave up running after a week because I wasn't feeling any different.  After a month of running around, I wasn't starting to feel some of the benefits.  My energy was up and my thighs were as lean as they were in my DDR haydays.  I didn't lose much weight, but I probably could if I changed my diet slightly.</p><div class='title'><b>"Running" the marathon</b></div><p>The day finally came.  Sunday morning, at 7am, Dave and I drove to the Alliant Energy Center, safety-pinned our numbers to our shirts, and lined up at the starting line with 3700 other people.  Gawd, it was freezing outside.  It was around 55 degrees and all we had on were these running shorts and a shirt.</p><p>But after the starting horn was bleeted and we ran consistently for about 2 miles, the cold weather was perfect.  Run, walk, run, walk, run, walk longer, run, walk longer.  Much like I figured, the half marathon wasn't difficult.  It was only 4 times the length of what I had done during training.</p><p>During the race, Dave and I chatted about other upcoming marathons.  We agreed that a Full Marathon is a too far for us for now, but were definitely interested in more Half Marathons.</p><p>The course for the Half Marathon was quite pretty. ^_^  It took us all over Madison, from Monona Bay, to St. Mary's Hospital, to Camp Randall, to the Agriculture area of UWMadison.  We went along the coastline of Lake Mendota, to Memorial Union.  Along Langdon St to James Madison Park up to Tenney Park, where we turned South East.  We went underneath East Washington and turned South West along Jenifer St.  From there, we met up with John Nolen Dr. and followed the coast of Lake Monona back to the Colliseum.  If you want a great tour of Madison, this Marathon is perfect.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>We screwed up our timing chips, so Dave and I don't have official results, but I remembered what the clock said when I passed the finish line.</p><p>I finished the Half Marathon at <b>2 hours 49 minutes and 56 seconds</b>.  And Dave finished about 10 seconds later.  Overall, we placed around 3450 out of 3700.  Whooo!  Not last.</p><p>Unlike Simon Pegg, the Marathon didn't solve all my problems.  But It definitely gave me the motivation to keep with an exercise routine.  Something that I've wanted for a while now.</p><p>Plus, I got a medal!  Yeah yeah, everyone gets a medal.  But it's more than a medal of participation, it's a medal of completion.  It's also more than just completing the marathon, it's also the 2 months of work I've put into myself leading up to the Marathon.  For the first time since college, I've actually lost some weight, rather than hovering around the same numbers.  I have more energy.  There's that feeling of accomplishment, too.</p><p>I worked out for 2 months, ran/walked further than I had at a given point in time, and got a medal for it!  Hot damn!  All because of a stupid movie.</p><p>Thanks Simon Pegg and Michael Ian Black ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>2:49:56 is a start.  And it's pretty good for first-timers + only 2 months of training.  But, hell, we can definitely do better.  I was 6th from last for my age group.</p><p>Dave and I signed up for 2 more Half Marathons this year.  The <a href="http://www.madisonminimarathon.com" title="http://www.madisonminimarathon.com">Madison Mini-Marathon</a> and the <a href="http://www.foxcitiesmarathon.org" title="http://www.foxcitiesmarathon.org">Fox Cities Half Marathon</a>.</p><p>The Madison Mini-Marathon course is another great introduction to some of the areas of Madison.  It actually goes up to Capitol Square, and then continues all the way down to Lake Wingra and back again.  It starts 7am on Saturday August 29th.</p><p>The Fox Cities Marathon starts in Appleton, goes through Mensha and ends in Neenah.  Should be interesting. ^_^ That one is 7am on Sunday September 20th.</p><p>Maybe next year, we'll have the strength to complete an actual Full Marathon.  Baby steps.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Indianapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/indianapolis">Indianapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
