| February 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Wednesday, after careful, clear and balanced thought, i just said to myself, "aww fuck it... "  I went into the Cingular store i signed up for the <a href="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp" title="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp">8525</a> phone that i outlined in my <a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars">previous post</a>.  This phone could do quite a bit, but whether or not it had Japanese Language Support and ability to work in Japan were questionable.</p><p>Well on this day, the guy i had been talking with for the past two weeks had those answers.  According to Cingular technical support, the phone does indeed work in Japan.  However, Microsoft does not provide any Japanese Language Support for the phone.  Though, he didn't stamp out the possibility altogether.  His technical guy also explained that with 3rd party software, Japanese Language Support is attainable.</p><p>At this point, the phone was pretty much complete and i really didn't want to wait another 2 or 3 weeks of careful, clear and balanced thought before i decide to come back here and probably get it anyways.  So i bought it..  huzzah.</p><p>But now i have this phone which is basically a laptop.  It has Microsoft Office on it for god sakes.  As i held it in my hands i thought to myself..  "ok.. this is just a little bit too much.  I don't need all of this..  why in the hell WOULD anyone need this amount of stuff on their phone unless they didn't have a laptop."</p><p>Buying something so grossly over-kill felt dirty..  i mean, if the thing wasn't a phone, it would be useless to me.  i was going against my cheap ass nature, into a realm of wasting money.  It feels like their had to be a cheaper sleeker alternative.  or something of that nature.  latching on unpolished technology is always a waste of money.  But whatever..  i can afford it, so where's the harm really.  I want a phone that can utilize Japanese and this is what is available to me.  :shrugs:  Later on in the evening, i started playing around with the phone.  Adding in contacts, setting up features..  It really wasn't all that bad...  I could get used to using it.</p><p>The next day, i decided to take it for a test run.. ya know,  Carry it around with me and see how it feels.  Hell, if it obstructs my daily comfort level, the thing has got to go.  Honestly, it's pretty comfortable.  I don't know how big you think it looks from the picture on their site, but it's just as big as my little wallet.  The phone i was borrowing from my mom is bigger in 2 out of 3 dimensions..  Of course, this thing is far more fragile than my mom's beast of a phone.</p><p>The 8525 had passed my comfort level test, so i guess it'll stay.  Now i bring down the whole gadgety feel of the phone to a personalized level and it'll work out just great.</p><p>I began looking for some phone software on the Internets of all places..  After typing in "Windows Mobile 5.0 Japanese", the first hit was what i was looking for: <a href="http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php" title="http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php">http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php</a> Mobem Technologies had created Chinese and Japanese support for my operating system.  Huzzah...  I haven't gotten around to ordering it yet though :/   The next thing i need to find it some weather application to tell me how fricken cold it is outside.</p><p>Another feature of the 8525 is that it connects to WiFi connections.  In fact, it'll search automatically for them, which is pretty funny.  It usually makes a sound when it finds one, but when it's on silent, it'll vibrate.  So when i'm driving down the street in my neighborhood, it'll vibrate a couple times because of all the secure connections.  How helpful.. ^_^  It's a war-driver's most convenient device.  The war-driving vibration is a little difficult than the phone call vibration, so i don't need to go digging in my pockets while i'm driving every time the thing goes off.  I haven't gotten any mail on my phone yet, so i'm not quite sure if it'll vibrate for that.  I hope it does, though..  I suppose i could test that though...</p><p>Anyways, i guess i'm happy with it, even though when my roommates first saw it they said, "that's a phone?!  guhhh?"  I figure that's going to be a lot of people's reactions ... :/  It needs a more phone-y look.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Erebus' first show @ The Clinic, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show">Erebus' first show @ The Clinic, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><em>Prepare yourself for a long winded, poorly written account of trying to find a 'good' American cellphone...</em></p><p>Prior to Japan, i really didn't care that much about Cell phone technology.  In fact, i had been resisting it for some time because i'm stubborn or something.  Over the summer, i borrowed a cell phone and used it quite a bit.  So much so, that i really couldn't even remember why i was putting off the whole cell phone thing.  Who really uses land lines these days anyways?</p><p>In Japan, i quickly learned that owning a cell phone is the only way to keep in contact with all your friends.  A Cellphone in Japan is like Instant Messager in America.  Hmm... the more i think about it, that comparison is pretty solid.  I'll write up that discussion some day.</p><p>Anyways, i like chatting with my friends no matter where i am with a very portable device, SO now that i'm back in America, i'm looking for a cellphone that can do all the fun things a Japanese Cellphone can do.</p><p>My primary wants for a cellphone are: Email, Internet, Compactness, and Japanese Language Support.  By Japanese Language Support, i mean the capibilities of reading and writing Japanese text with the phone.  Then i could read Japanese RSS feeds, but more importantly, send and receive emails from my pals in Nippon.  One of my secondary wants is to have the phone actually work in Japan, as well.<br/>I figured these objectives wouldn't be to difficult to complete.  I'm sure some cellphones would have Japanese language support and still look like a phone.  This'll be easy... ha ha ha.</p><p>Incorrect.  I went to Best Buy a few days after i moved to Madison, and jesus...  I didn't think the selection would be this bad.  Japan has fricken department stores full of hundreds of different cellphones to choose from in 3 or 4 separate colors.  Best Buy had 3 to 5 different cellphones for the 3 big providers: Sprint, Cingular and Verizon.  There's some culture shock for you.  The Best Buy cellular section looked like a rundown bargain basement going out of business sale compared to something you'd see in Japan.</p><p>American cellphones look so retro.  The design was built around the chip-set and innards, rather than designing a neat a cellphone and then figuring out how to fit everything into it.  It's like comparing the DS Fat to the DS Lite.  The DS Fat is horribly ugly and HUGE.</p><p>Anyways.. everyone seemed to like the Motorola RAZR, so i thought this would work out pretty good for me.  After seeing one in front of me, i was pretty turned off.  I didn't realize it was that wide, plus the key pad didn't really appeal to me.</p><p>No cellphone really jumped out at me at all, so i began attacking the situation from a different view point: "What provider should i go with?"  After talking with the Best Buy guy, it seemed that i really had two options to choose from: either Cingular or Verizon.  He showed me the phones they had for both providers and none of them had Japanese Language Support.  He suggested that i go with Cingular since their network is designed in such a way that it might be possible to use one of their phones in Japan.  Well, that sounded like a good path to follow up on.  "Where might i find a Cingular merchant, kind sir?"  "down the road near Wendy's"  "i know where that is!"</p><p>The Cingular store wasn't half bad.  Minus the selection, it's pretty similar to a Soft Bank, AU, or Docomo store in Japan.  Though, Japan cellular phone retailers have a bunch of brochures advertising their fall-line up of phones, and even some brochures for individual phones too.  I think that can be boiled into selection.</p><p>I'm greeted by a Cingular phone rep. to which i explain my cellular wants and desires.  For Japanese Language Support, he said the only phones available with such capabilities were PDA style phones.  Phones that are somewhat expensive, somewhat larger than i'd like, and do far more than what i need.  Such a thing really didn't appeal to me, especially since all the PDA style phones looked really ugly.. like Calculator ugly.  Nothing stood out as totally awesome..  However; he indicated that any language pack could be installed on here since it runs an OS, thus solving my language problem.</p><p>So... at this point, it seemed that if i were to accomplish my primary objective of Japanese Language Support, i need a PDA phone which basically runs a tiny version of Windows.</p><p>I decided to leave with the expectation of looking on the Cingular website for stuff, and further my investigation of Japanese language oriented phones in America.   The next day, i went over to the Verizon store to see if anything stuck out as really neat or amazing.  One phone did kind of catch my eye.   I think it was <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=2686&changingCompletedOrder=" title="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=2686&changingCompletedOrder=">this phone</a>.  It was really shiny, somewhat compact, and fit into my pocket.  Unfortunately, it only had limited web capabilities, and NO Gmail services, aside from having no Japanese Language Support.  I put it on the 'think about it' pile in my head as i left the store.  All of their PDA phones were just as hideous as Cingular's, so i left the store with the same expectation as before..</p><p>I searched around on Google and came across the <a href="http://www.iphone.com/" title="http://www.iphone.com/">iPhone</a>, which is quite beautiful.  Runs an OS, does a bunch of crazy stuff.  It went immediately to the top of my list, since it accomplished everyone of my goals, except connectivity in Japan.  (of course, no other cell phone i found thus far had connectivity)  Perhaps i'll hop aboard the hype-wagon for this piece of equipment, i thought.  I'll be the coolest kid at school, plus be able to chat with my Japanese friends.</p><p>Next, I went on Cingular's website, which had the iPhone right out front, and searched for some contact email to inquire about Japanese capabilities and all that jazz.  When looking for the email, i found the <a href="http://forums.cingular.com/" title="http://forums.cingular.com/">Cingular Support Forums</a>, which had categories ranging from Customer Support to Phone Details to International Capabilities.  I took a look at the International section and found a couple thread of people trying to use their phones in Japan.  Hot Dog, this is what i was looking for.  The thread indicated that <a href="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp" title="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp">Cingular's 8525</a> PDA phone was the only Cingular phone that actually worked in Japan.</p><p>This is because the 8525 uses Tri-UMTS and Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE frequencies to connect to as many networks around the Globe as possible.  America mainly uses GSM, where Japan uses UMTS.  Such networks are completely incompatible with each other, therefore you need a phone that can do both if you want to have your phone work in both places.</p><p>I must've glossed over this phone before because it really wasn't all that hideous compared to other PDA phones.  It stored the keyboard in a sliding manor for compactness and comfortability.  The screen was the larger than all the other PDA phones at Cingular and Verizon.  It's certainly no iPhone, but, if it works in Japan, then that's something the iPhone can't do.  It does pretty much everything else the iPhone does, but doesn't look as cool.  Eh...  i think i'll stay on the iPhone hype-wagon.</p><p>The iPhone is Cingular exclusive (for now), but didn't come out until June.  "Maybe i'll just get some crappy phone now, and then switch over to the iPhone upon its release," i thought.  Matt and I had a couple of iPhone hype moments over the weekend ^_^.  Though, Gage clued me into some other opinions when i mentioned my cellphone plans.  "You might want to look into things a little more..  Some cellphone forums have been dissin' the iPhone left and right saying <b>it has the same capabilities of current phones</b> and <b>it is far over priced for what it's worth</b>."  hmmm..  i should probably look into the full details if there are indeed current phones with similar technologies.</p><p>I continued looking into the 8525, but ran into several dead ends online.  I figured that it was time to see this thing in person.  After work on Monday, i visited the Cingular store again for the pure purposes of doing such things.</p><p>After seeing it in person, it really didn't turn me off as much as the other PDA phones had before.  It was actually smaller than i thought it was..  About the same size as my crappy Nokia phone i'm borrowing at the moment, except a little wider.  The 8525 is also smaller than the iPhone as well.  The screen is larger than all their other PDA phones, not as large as the iPhone screen, though.  It can synch up with Outlook on my PC to keep all my contact information current.  It has Microsoft Office on the phone, so i could write up a term paper... if i had to?  It utilizes WiFi, so when i'm near a wireless network, I can use that to connect to the internet rather than a cellphone tower.  You can also write messages using the touch pad rather than the keyboard, and the 8525 will conform to your writing style.  I also asked the guy about battery life, and he said that if i charge it every night, it'll work out just fine.  Pretty much all this stuff is what the iPhone can do... i think.</p><p>I was pretty impressed with the little thing.  It's like a little laptop.  With a 2 year plan, the phone itself costs $400 and to utilize the Internet and all that jazz it would be $80 a month.  $40 for phone, $40 for internet, and then an extra $36 activation fee.  Yeesh..  that's a bit expensive, but...  i can afford it.  The low-end iPhone costs $500 with a 2 year plan, so with the 8525 i'm saving a little bit of money..</p><p>I inquired about my cheeky plan of starting a plan with a crappy phone, and getting the iPhone upon its release.  "well, if you want to change phones in the middle of your service then you must pay the full cost of the phone w/o rebates or deals or anything.  That'll be like $700 or $800, then."  Eckk.. Well i don't plan on doing that anymore...</p><p>But next i asked the real question..  Can it actually work in Japan?</p><p>After consulting his friend, they came back with a 'no'.  "o rly? this contradicts previous evidence."  We went on over to the computer and researched it a little bit.  I showed him the thread i found on the Cingular forums stated that it was possible..  Though, his employee friend stated that he has a customer who actually tried it and did not have success.  The technical problem was that even though the 8525 utilizes UMTS, the bandwidth isn't high enough to match the 2100hz UMTS network of Japan..  or something like that.  But..  being a nice guy, the clerk replied, "well... lemme look into this a little more.  I'll make some calls and send some emails to people and get a definite answer for you."  "okey dokey..  that sounds pretty good, mate"</p><p>_____</p><p>So that is where i stand at this very moment.  This 8525 is smaller, does pretty much the same stuff, is cheaper (just a little), is available and might actually work in Japan.  The iPhone is prettier, does the same stuff neater, and has larger memory capacities.  I think the big thing is that i'm looking for a cellphone now..  not six months from now.  I don't really plan on using my phone as an mp3 player, either.  (and) i GUESS i could forgo the flashy stuff to have something that looks really buttoned down and business like.</p><p>If the 8525 actually does work in Japan, well holy shit... sign me up.  If it doesn't work, i think i'll probably still go with it anyways.  Even if it doesn't work with the Japanese UMTS network, the Wifi connection should still get me onto the Internet.</p><p>I'll probably be back at the Cingular store on Thursday to pick it up unless i come across any major complaints about it..  I'll certainly need to double check the whole Japanese Language Support functionality with Windows Mobile.</p><p>sigh... So much work for something that seems so simple.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Jury Duty" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/jury-duty">Jury Duty</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>ahh... the joys of trying to get out of jury duty.</p><p>Way back in June last year, my parents got a little notice in the mail from the Court Administration of Hennepin County.  Out of everyone in the county and amongst many others, i was selected to serve Jury Duty.  Well, at the time i couldn't do such a thing since i was living in Madison and working 50 ish hours a week.  I couldn't really postpone it to the immediate future either because i was going off to Japan, which is also not near downtown Minneapolis.</p><p>I called up the jury office and said such things and they asked when i could serve jury duty within the next six months.  I said, "oh i dunno... how about the second week in January or something like that.."  and thus it was written.</p><p>I got back from Japan and putzed around for a while.  The Thursday before i was moving down to Madison to start my new job, my mom reminds me that i had Jury duty on Monday...  which i had completely forgot about.  I probably would've paid more attention to it, had i no plans to try and get out of it again.  So i'm all like, "whatever..  i'll call 'em up tomorrow and tell i can't go. wheee."</p><p>Tomorrow came; i had the day off.  I called them up later in the afternoon to continue my streak of lazy.  "i'm sorry," i say, "but i can't make it in on Monday..  i'm.. uh...  moving down to Madison this weekend and start my job Monday."  Though, this was a bit of a lie.  The monday of my jury duty was January 8th, and the monday of starting my job was January 15th.  "you can't come in on Monday..?  This is a little short notice.  I mean..  we'll need some kind of proof... and...  you haven't even sent in your questionnaire.  can you fax us something that proves you start on Monday?"  "uhhh...  no i can't do that because i don't have any of that with me..  and blah blah blah."  "well can you fax us something on Monday morning when you're at your job?"  "....k"</p><p>So...  now i was in a bit of a pickle.  Caught in a lie to the court, it would seem.  Well, first thing i did was go to their website and fill out that questionnaire.  And.. i planned on going downtown on Monday and saying something like, "oh crap... i got the weeks messed up.  i actually start next week 'n stuff. nurrr."</p><p>Bright and Early, Monday morning, i skipped out of Pharmacy work pretty early, and went downtown to get their at 9am.  I looked all over the letter and figured that 9am was when i was supposed to be there.  I got to the court building, went where i was supposed to and found nothing.  It was pretty empty.  All the doors were closed and looked like nothing was going on.  I walked around the building a little bit and asked information where to go.  They sent me right back to where i was.  There's a big sign that says, "Jury Administration" with an arrow pointing to the door.  I got closer and heard some voices inside.  The door was opened a crack, so i poked my head in and saw a large auditorium filled with about 200 people listening to a lecturer.<br/>"crap..  am i late, or something?" i thought.  I took a look at my letter a little more closely and saw that i was ACTUALLY supposed to get there at 8:15am.  "Well shit..  45 minutes late," i thought, "Screw this.. i'm taking off.  i told 'em i wasn't going to be here anyways."  I got back and emailed Bryan at my job about that proof of employment.</p><p>At this point i figured..  they have the fax about my employment, and i didn't show up, which i told them i wasn't.  eh, i should be fine.  No need to call them and have everything sorted out.  They can call me if they have any problems...  Though, i guess i'll need to get citizenship to Wisconsin to prove i live there.. sigh.</p><p>Well, on Wednesday i got a new piece of mail from the Court Administration of Hennepin County.  "This should be interesting..." i thought, "probably some letter bitching about my absence downtown."  As luck would have it, it was the exact opposite of that scenario.</p><p>The letter stated that after reviewing my questionnaire i had completed, Hennepin County would not need my services for Jury Duty.  So, i guess all that running around was really all for not.  huzzah.  now i don't need to get a Wisconsin Driver's license until i move somewhere less temporary.</p><p>My little brother told me something that day that he heard from some standup comedian.  "There's no way i'd ever commit some huge crime because it puts my life in the hands of 12 people not smart enough to get out of Jury duty."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Multipart Email Messages" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/multipart-email-messages">Multipart Email Messages</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

if the message has attachments<br/>- multipart/alternative - if the message has a text/plain alt for it's html part<br/>- text/plain - if the message is just text<br/>- text/html - if the message is just html</p><p>once i had this graph, building the code was rather easy..  you've got 4 entry points (indicated by the * above) and 2 exit points.  return text/html if it exists, otherwise return text/plain:<br/><pre><br/><b></b>    private BodyMessage getMessageBody(Message msg) throws MessagingException, IOException<br/><b></b>    {<br/><b></b>        Part messagePart = msg;<br/><b></b>        String contentType = msg.getContentType();<br/><b></b>        Object content = messagePart.getContent();<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        while(contentType.contains("multipart/mixed"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            //if the message type is mixed, grab the first child<br/><b></b>            //the other children are attachments<br/><b></b>            messagePart = ((Multipart) content).getBodyPart(0);<br/><b></b>            content = messagePart.getContent();<br/><b></b>            contentType = messagePart.getContentType();<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        if(contentType.contains("multipart/alternative"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            //if the message type is an alternative, grab the text/html part (second part)<br/><b></b>            try<br/><b></b>            {<br/><b></b>                messagePart = ((Multipart) content).getBodyPart(1);<br/><b></b>            }<br/><b></b>            catch(Exception e)<br/><b></b>            {<br/><b></b>                //or grab the text/plain part, if the text/html part doesn't exist.<br/><b></b>                messagePart = ((Multipart) content).getBodyPart(0);<br/><b></b>            }<br/><b></b>            content = messagePart.getContent();<br/><b></b>            contentType = messagePart.getContentType();<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        if(contentType.contains("text/plain"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            return new BodyMessage(content.toString(), "text/plain");<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b>        else if(contentType.contains("text/html"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            return new BodyMessage(content.toString(), "text/html");<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b>        return new BodyMessage("No text found in received message.", "text/plain");<br/><b></b>    }<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>    private class BodyMessage<br/><b></b>    {<br/><b></b>        public String msg;<br/><b></b>        public String mimeType;<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        public BodyMessage(String msg, String mimeType)<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            this.msg = msg;<br/><b></b>            this.mimeType = mimeType;<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b>    }<br/></pre><br/>____</p><p>interesting enough, i had come across this same type of multipart interface before when developing the file uploading application with ASP/VBscript.</p><p>Whenever you want to use an HTML form to send a file somewhere you must use the multipart/form-data encoding type for the form, like so:<br/><pre><br/>&lt;form name="form" id="form" method="post" action="fileupload.jsp" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;<br/></pre><br/>that will grab all the raw binary data from the file, and slap it onto the Request object sent to the next page.  parts of the internet aren't so mutually exclusively coded after all, are they? ^_^</p><p>also, through stress testing the form submitting file uploading, 2 gigs of data is far too large.  the form can't build and send the data without crashing.  the limitations of html.  i'd guess more than 2^31 bytes is too much.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Updates?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/event">Updates?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I asked Tom, the pharmacist, "Why did a product that was clearly for humans need to be labeled 'human'?  Is there some specific animal insulin or...?"  "No no.." he replied.</p><p>Up until around 1991, the pharmacuetical industry used animal insulin injected into humans.  Mostly from farm animals such as cows and pigs.  It worked, but it wasn't perfect.  Numerous times, the diabetic's body would attack parts of the insulin that didn't match with our DNA resulting in an unsightly pocket underneath the skin.</p><p>With advancements of cloning, insulin culturers began to grow human bacteria and used them to produce actual human insulin. This is the insulin we know and use today to help balance levels within diabetics, and is why the box specifically said Human on it, rather than Pig or Horse.</p><p>The new insulin is a perfect match to our DNA structure with no side effects from the cloning process. So, they've been steadily phasing out the old barnyard insulin for the past decade or so since the cloned insulin is nearly flawless.  </p><p>Everyday advancement in the pharmacuetical industry is made, as chemical compounds in drugs are refined and condensed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Stressed Out!

I worked all Friday and Saturday grinding away at Modern Algebra and SPAMM upkeep. My brain was fried, so I couldn't concentrate today. There's still so much that needs to be done before school finished in 4 weeks.</p><p>Because I was sick, I decided to eat a bunch of ramen! I'm out of eggs, so I just ate the ramen straight with no fancy additions.</p><p>Today was all about <b>Maruchan Brand Ramen Noodle Soup Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>I cracked open my 6-pack that I purchased for a mere 81 cents. It was the deal of the century! 81 cents for 6! I ate 2 earlier. Later on, I ate a third without even cooking it! I just munched on the noodles, and saved the seasoning for the next meal.</p><p>Man, I don't know why people are so down on Maruchan brand ramen. Of course, it's not the best. But it is not terrible. It's the perfect par in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good flavored soup. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good noodles. And, it doesn't fail at the combination of the two, either.</p><p>I'd say that I ate pretty well today for a net total of 50 cents. What else could you possibly buy for 50 cents? You couldn't buy a Snickers bar. You couldn't buy a bottle of soda. You could buy one of those jumbo gumboils. Or, a hand full of that other crap. But, enough to feed you for a day? No, sir. It also started to heal my illness, too!</p><p>Anywho, despite most people's opinions, I give Chicken Maruchan Ramen a par score of <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. Man, I'm going to buy a few more of these 6 packs before they sell out. I also need eggs, bread, and tuna, and maybe something else to make into fried rice.</p><p>Holy crap! I just noticed that there are recipes on the back to create more interesting dishes. Two of them are standard salads, so who the fuck cares. The other one makes an interesting soup. I should buy some mushrooms and veggies to make this.</p><p>—</p><p>The other day, I had some ramen out of my non-trash stash. I picked out this crazy Korean stuff, <b>Secret Samyang Brand Roasted Chajang Chacharoni Noodles</b>. Secret only because the brand name was hidden on the other side of the package. Hiding something, maybe?</p><p>It was certainly interesting. Everything seemed normal until I added the seasoning into the mix. As I squeezed out the beef stuff, it looked like globs of black ink. It didn't want to come out. When it did, it was heavy and stuck together. After I got most of it out of the pouch, I stirred and blended it into the soup. It turned instantly dark! The noodles absorbed a good amount of the ink, too.</p><p>It tasted pretty good! Though, I'm not sure what was in the other pouch. It could've been cat food for all I know. Little crunchy looking pellets that seemed to disappear once they were added in the soup</p><p>It was quite different than any ramen I've had before. Though, it wasn't all that great. I give Samyang's Roasted Chajang Chacharoni a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Interesting stuff, though there is better. Worth at least one try.</p><p>—</p><p>For my second entree, I wanted something I knew would be crap. I wanted to balance out of the meal with what I just had. I also wanted to save the good stuff, too. I ended up going with <b>5-Minute Express Instant Ramen Noodles Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>These were the cheap Canadian noodles I found at the Dollar store. </p><p>Not a whole lot can be said about this stuff. It also had a solid base with no extra bells or whistles. No veggies or strange soup altering agents. Just simple noodles, and simple soup.</p><p>All in all, I thought it was good. But after my Maruchan Chicken binge earlier today, it pales in comparison to the standards of the United States. I gave 5-Minute Express Chicken Ramen a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Not only does Maruchan taste better, but it's cheaper, too. For the same price, I could get an alternative flavor of Maruchan, rather than Chicken.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to School Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/school-work-and-ramen">School Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All those software projects have backed up since my group and I didn't meet last night. Now, we have to scramble today to catch up. We have a lot of work to do in the next week. I have lots of assignments due tomorrow, too. @_@</p><p>Sigh, but in other news, I had some more ramen this afternoon. Some pretty good stuff, too!</p><p>First off, I had <b>Samyang Brand Sutah Ramen Rich Hot Flavor</b>.</p><p>I saw this package, and I immediately thought, "Holy shit! This is what I'm having today!" Although, I am skeptical now when making Samyang ramen. All their previous ones had turned into sludge, and this is not what I want. Maybe this one would have, too, but I made some corrections. After placing the noodles in the water, I added a little more water. It cooled down the boil, but I let it sit for a few minutes.</p><p>This meal was quite extensive, like the Nong Shim stuff. There was a pouch of soup base, a pouch for the veggies, and another pouch of solid base. I put the solid base in the water first. A little alter, I added the veggies, soup base, and an egg, too.</p><p>This stuff turn out FANTASTIC! Extremely delicious. I was surprised. Although, it makes sense given the quality of packaging and ingredients. It was pretty hot & spicy, but just right for my taste buds. The noodles and seasoning blended perfectly together for the slightly baked taste. Great stuff! I give Sutah Ramen a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Nice job!</p><p>Secondly, I had <b>Nissin Brand Instant Noodles Prawn Flavor</b>.</p><p>Prawn is another specie of Shrimp, by the way. This ramen is also known as the one with the little ramen guy running around on the cover.</p><p>I am a little biased towards Seafood flavored noodles because I LOVE seafood quite a lot. And this stuff totally delivered on the taste. Very seafood-esq. Though, the overall quality of the dish was similar to the cheapness of Maruchan and other American brand noodles. Chucks of crab may have saved this dish, so maybe I'll try that next time.</p><p>Anywho, I give this one a <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. It wasn't bad, but it lacked in overall style and deliciousness.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ramen Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ramen-catchup">Ramen Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 5, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After finally getting caught up with everything in my school life, I started cooking up some of the ramen that I acquired over the weekend.</p><p>First off, I made <b>Nong Shim Brand Neoguri Udon Noodle Soup Seafood & Spicy</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" /></p><p>This was a dish I had made before, but I didn't grade it. I think I fucked up making it or something. They are supposed to be udon noodles, so making them in the microwave is a bit tricky. It takes a lot longer for the noodles to absorb the boiling water and soften. Now, it's no longer a problem for me because I'm using a stovetop. Cooking ramen over heat is the absolute best way to get the best taste out of the instant noodles.</p><p>This stuff was quite good this time. I don't remember how it ended up last time. Probably, the noodles were still hard and tasted funny. Not this time, though. The noodles absorbed the water and seasoning beautifully, and tasted so delicious. The soup was also quite delicious. The perfect blend of spice, veggies, and egg. No ramen sludge. I give Nong Shim's Seafood & Spicy Udon Noodles a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Extremely delicious! And extemely recommended.</p><p>---</p><p>Next up, to counter the Korean excellent, I went with the instant bowled <b>Nissin Brand UFO Yakisoba Oriental Noodle w/ Soup Base</b>.</p><p>Yes, UFO as in Unidentified Flying Object, as spelling out on the cover. I don't get it, but this stuff was certainly NOT out of this world.</p><p>It's not possible to make Yakisoba how it was illustrated on the cover. It can only end up being noodles with yakisoba flavoring. And the yakisoba flavoring tasted like runny meat. It wasn't as bad as that Ichiban Yakisoba, though. This stuff didn't have that crappy taste, and it pulled itself together a little bit. Someone who actually liked yakisoba would proably like it. I give UFO Yakisoba a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I don't think it's possible to make a truly good instant Yakisoba.</p><p>---</p><p>And finally, last week sometime, I made <b>Myojo Brand Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Crab Flavor</b>.</p><p>Speaking of noodles you can't possibly translate into an instant meal, udon noodles will never turn out how they are supposed to. Completely absorbent of their seasoning and meat products soaked in the soup. I tried to boil them longer with the soup base in the broth, but it just doesn't work.</p><p>None the less, this stuff didn't turn out too bad. I find it really odd how well eggs break up in the soup base when making these refrigerated instant meals. It's really weird. Also weird, this stuff tasted nothing like crab. It tasted more like that Chicken flavor in the Maruchan brand ramen. Next time I make this stuff, I certainly must add in that immitation crab they sell at my local grocer. That'll prove to be a delicious meal. But, in the mean time, Myogo Udon Noodles gets a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Better luck next time.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/16">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/14">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
