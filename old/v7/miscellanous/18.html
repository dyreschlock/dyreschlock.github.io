This game has style! </p><p>Nostalgia plays into the story, as the main character is a huge fan of old superhero movies, and then becomes one after being sucked into it. Viewtiful is a classic side-scrolling platformer, so nostalgia also plays into the gameplay. Though, not just any side-scroller, a CAPCOM side-scroller! It gave me fond flashbacks of playing Mega Man back in the day. When you turn into a super hero, you even look like Mega Man a little bit ^_^</p><p>Beyond that, the game is really difficult, too. The learning curve is more of a learning cliff! It's very far, though, which makes it fun and challenging. Today I beat Adult Mode (Normal), so I've unlocked the V-Rated mode (hard difficulty). After that, there's an Ultra V-Rated mode, too. I started playing through V-Rated, and the first level posed no problem at all. The second level is kicking my ass, though.</p><p>Taking a break, I ate <b>Mama Brand Oriental Style Instant Noodle Chand Tom Yum</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_chand_tomyum.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_chand_tomyum.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_chand_tomyum.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't realize it was Chand until now. I don't really like Chand noodles. I think they are too flimsy and they always fall apart.</p><p>These weren't bad, though! After adding everything together, I only cooked it for 45 seconds because of how flimsy the Chand noodles usually are. I though it worked out well, until everything felt apart anyway. Sigh... They still tasted good, though. The Tom Yum flavored soup was pretty good. Quite tasty. So overall, I give these Tom Yum Chand noocldes a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>And now I'm out of eggs, so I will make a sandwich rather than more ramen. I only have Chand noodles left, anyway.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chili Ramen on a Chilly Day" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chili-ramen-on-a-chilly-day">Chili Ramen on a Chilly Day</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm really surprised how much I like it despite being a straight-up action game. Even though it is difficult, it's not impossible, and it feels so satisfying to make progress.</p><p>Anyway, earlier today I had not eaten much, so I went through my bag of ramen and choose <b>Maruchan's Ramen Noodle Soup Chili Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/maruchan_chili.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/maruchan_chili.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/maruchan_chili.webp" /></p><p>To recall, Maruchan is an American brand of instant ramen that you can buy at nearly any grocery outlet. The package says, "Careful, hot hot hot" HA! Compared to the depths of hell where the Asian countries mined their spices, this doesn't event come CLOSE. Ahahhahah. You have no idea the meaning of the word 'hot' Try that Nong Shin Hot & Spicy, and your eyes will BLEED. This is mild at best.</p><p>Besides that, this stuff was actually pretty good. It was much better than the Roast Chicken flavored stuff from before. Strong noodles. Bland seasoning, though. I give it the same score as the other Maruchan ramen, whatever it was. Probably <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>Back to Viewtiful Joe and more drinking!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hot Ramen on a Cold Day" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hot-ramen-on-a-cold-day">Hot Ramen on a Cold Day</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

When I left this morning for school, it was cold. Cold Cold Cold. It was so cold that some girl was apparently suffereing from pnuemonia, shivering to death as the paramedics were revitalizing her. Rather horrific.</p><p>Anyway, I revitalized myself with more noodles. To start the night, I choose <b>Mama Brand Instant Noodle Pa-Lo Duck Flavored</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_palo_duck.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_palo_duck.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_palo_duck.webp" /></p><p>I remembered the last time I had Duck ramen. It was extrememly spicey. This time was not. Again, I added an egg, so I think that soaked up most of the spiciness and made for a smoother taste. I give Mama Brand Pa-Lo Duck Flavor a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>Next on the menu was <b>Wai Wai Brand Tom Yum Shrimp Clear Soupl Flavour Instant Noodle</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_tomyum.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_tomyum.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_tomyum.webp" /></p><p>My theory of eggs soaking up the spice was completely thrown out the window here. *cough* ack..  I thought my cooking ability had gotten around this death level of spice, but I was wrong. The big problem was that all of the spices were in a single pouch. They weren't broken up into separate packets like a GOOD ramen company would do. <b>1 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>Man, I almost completely drank an entire jug of V8 Splash eating this ramen. And it looked so good, too! What happened? Ugh, my stomach is going to be pissed off all night long. And I'm hot. Too hot. And I'm out of cereal. NooOoooooOOOOOOoooo!</p><p>--</p><p>Meanwhile, later, I went to the grocery store, and bought some American ramen, <b>Maruchan's Ramen Noodle Soup Roast Chicken Flavor</b>. This is Seb's ramen of choice.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/maruchan_rchicken.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/maruchan_rchicken.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/maruchan_rchicken.webp" /></p><p>The noodles were very strong compared to the ramen from the Asian market. But, the soup was very bland. It tasted like flavored water. And adding an egg while cooking didn't help out anything. Overall, it wasn't terrible, so Maruchan's Roast Chicken Ramen gets a <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>I bought another Maruchan ramen too. I'll probably eat it tomorrow.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mama and Waiwai" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mama-and-waiwai">Mama and Waiwai</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 28, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I was quite hungry after class this afternoon, so I made some ramen. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_shrimp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_shrimp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_shrimp.webp" /></p><p>First off, after I ran to the store to pick up some eggs, I made <b>Mama Brand Oriental Style Instant Noodle Artificial Shrimp Flavour (Tom Yum)</b>. This leads me to believe that Tom Yum = Artificial Shrimp. Or, maybe Tom Yum = Chili Shrimp. I'm not quite sure. Inside the package was a seperate pouch of chili powder. Thank god! I was able to set the spicy level to my liking. I only used a pinch.</p><p>After cooking the ramen in my usual way, it turned out quite good. I mixed in the egg a lot so there weren't any huge chunks left in the bowl, only a few bits here and there. The spiciness level was perfect, which made this dish very enjoyable. I give Mama Brand Shrimp (Tom Yum) Noodles a <b>4 out of 5 stars</b>. It gets a high rating for having separate chili powder, and tasting very very good. The noodles were strong, and cooked well. The soup had an excellent taste. And, with the egg inside bring the total to 4 1/2.  The whole dish actually looked pleasing too. ^_^</p><p>One batch of ramen never really does it for me. I made a second batch of <b>Wai Wai Brand Instant Noodles Oriental Style</b>.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_oriental.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_oriental.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_oriental.webp" /></p><p>The package kinda looked like it was advertising watermelon candy, though. I used the usually approach to cooking: boiled water, added noodles, seasoning, then egg, cooked again for 2 minutes, and covered for a minute or so. LET ME TELL YOU!, the noodles were fan-fucking-tastic. It was like they were slightly cooked and seasoned beforehand.  Very very tasty! And, like the previous ramen, chili powder was packaged seperately from the main powder.</p><p>How did it taste? Excellent! Oh my, very very good.  </p><p>There is a problem though, the seasoning for the soup had no real context, no flavor. I could taste the chili, but nothing from the other two packs of seasoning. It was disapointing for such good noodles.  I must give this ramen, as a whole, <b>4 out of a 5 stars</b> because of the flavor failings. It is sad, but I've still got plenty more ramen left to go.  If Wai Wai can pull together its tasty noodles with tasty flavor, then this will probably be my perferred ramen.  But I have not yet found it.</p><p>Now to face the cold and go to my last class of the day, and then work. I think tonight will be a fried-rice night. I don't think my stomach likes all of these watery meals. Eating ramen is basically drinking a bowl of water. You won't gain any weight from it, but it doesn't really sound all that healthy either. Anywho, if anyone wants some fried-rice, lemme know when i get home tonight. I will put enough rice in the cooker. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Advertising and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/advertising-and-ramen">Advertising and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm in love with the Lodoss War poster. ^_^</p><p>After SPAMM, I ate another batch of ramen with my last egg. This was one of my few remanining pro ramens, <b>Mama's Oriental Style Instant Chand Noodles Beef Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chand_beef.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chand_beef.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chand_beef.webp" /></p><p>Beef isn't a very common ramen flavor, for some reason. It's usually some kind of "oriental" this or "oriental" that. I wasn't afraid of it being spicy. None of the previous Chand noodle dishes had strong spice at all.</p><p>To cook the noodles, first, I boiled the water. When the water came to a boil, I added in the noodles. After they broke apart and started to become soft, I added the seasoning. When adding the egg, this time, I made sure to mix it thoroughly into the contents of the bowl. Seconds after putting the egg into the very hot water, it almost instantly began to cook. Wicked. I continued stirring and cooking for about 30 seconds, and then covered it for a while.</p><p>In the end, it tasted pretty good! I think the egg really helps out A LOT! I'm adding an egg to the ramen every single time from now on. I think it adds a lot to the dish. I'm also getting better at cooking ramen too, so that is improving the taste, too. There is definitely a science to cooking instant noodles. Most America noodles have no finesse and no science to the cooking method. These Asian imports take a little more effort, but the results are worth it.</p><p>In this case, too, I think I really prefer the beef flavor compared with others. In the end, I'm giving Mama's Beef Flavored Chand Noodles a 2 1/2 out of 5 stars. But, with the egg added into the mix, I think it elevates it to the <b>3 1/2</b>.</p><p>So, today I have learned that eggs equal better ramen. I suggest you try it out next time you make ramen. You won't be disappointed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Triple Threat" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/triple-threat">Triple Threat</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 26, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight, I made three Instant noodle meals out of my pile.</p><p>---</p><p>I started off quite terribly with <b>Wai Wai's Minced Pork Tom Yum Flavour Instant Noodle</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_tomyom.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_tomyom.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_tomyom.webp" /></p><p>First off, the noodle were very dark and crisp and did not cook very well.  Even though I cooked them an extra minute and a half, they were still crispy. I poured more boiling water on them (and all over my counter), and covered them for an additional two minutes. They still tasted pretty stale.</p><p>But, I gotta give them credit.  I did finish eating the whole thing despite their spiciness. Maybe I'm getting used to the spice, or maybe I was just really hungrey. None the less, I give Wai Wai's Tom Yum Flavored Noodles <b>1 star out of a possible 5</b>. These noodles really sucked.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/kungfu_chicken.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/kungfu_chicken.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/kungfu_chicken.webp" /></p><p>On the positive end of things, I tried another Kung Fu ramen, <b>Ve Wong's Kung Fu Instant Oriental Noodle Soup, Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>Much like their Shrimp dish, it is very very smooth. And the Chicken Flavor adds an American taste to it. Though, unlike the previous Kung Fu ramen, I cooked it for less time to allow the noodles to keep some strength. And it came out really well. I should have experimented with some eggs, but oh well.</p><p>I gave Kung Fu Chicken Ramen <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. I liked it, but it's still not all that professionally made, in my opinion. The Shin Ramyun noodles are way better.</p><p>I'm still somewhat hungry, so I'm going to make a third for tonight. I choose <b>Wai Wai's Tom Klong Flavour Instant Noodle quick!</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_klong.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_klong.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/waiwai_klong.webp" /></p><p>This wasn't my ideal choice after the failure of the earlier Wai Wai crap. But, this was packaged differently, as you'll notice in the picture above. It is easily recognized by the "Oh my!" face on the front.</p><p>I wanted to experiment a little bit this time. After I boiled the water, I put in the noodles, seasoning, and also an egg on top. I mixed it up, and then cooked it for 2 minutes. Not a smart idea as the egg was cooked too much in those 2 minutes. In the end, the bowl had large chunks of egg in it. I probably should have cooked it for 1 minute instead.  it didn't bother me, though, its just egg and ramen.  But, like I had hoped, the egg did soak up a lot of the flavor in the soup, which made eating the spicy stuff more bearable.</p><p>It was actually pretty good. I give Wai Wai Quick! Tom Klong Flavor, otherwise known as the noodles with the face on it, a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I was quite an upgrade, considering the other crap earlier. Although, I think the egg helped this one A LOT.  The noodles themselves tasted very good without being cooked, too.  Tasty crunchy noodles.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Bowling and Kung-Fu Shrimp" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/bowling-kunfu-shrimp">Bowling and Kung-Fu Shrimp</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

True enough, the packet was extremely spicy. But there was only one pack, so i just dumped everything in there and didn't really care all that much.</p><p>This instant meal was one of those where you pour boiling water into a bowl of noodles and seasoning. Then, let the whole thing cook by itself for a couple minutes after that.  </p><p>After it was done, the whole thing had a very strong smell, almost too strong.  *cough*  The noodles had a very plastic texture, too.  They didn't taste like noodles at all and felt very stale.  I may have gotten some fucked up package of this stuff, but overall, I think it was not very good.</p><p>I give Myojo's Instant Noodle Duck Flavour <b>1 out of 5 stars</b>.  blahck.. akc..  Not delicious.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_pohtak.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_pohtak.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_pohtak.webp" /></p><p>Next up is <b>Mama's Instant Noodles Poh Tak Flavour</b>.</p><p>I pre-tasted for spiciness, and it was actually rather smooth for a change.  It was an interesting change compared to the others.  </p><p>These noodles were prepared in the same way to the normal instant noodles.  Poor in boiling water, then cover for 3 minutes.  This method did not work out at all, though. The noodles were still very stiff after the 3 minute mark. I think from now on i'm going to cook all these meals for 3 minutes after I poor in the boiling water.</p><p>The poh tak flavor ended up being too spicy to consume after all, which was sad.  I thought I had finally found a good tasting ramen. Unfortunately, Mama's Instant Noodles Poh Tak flavour receives <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>.  Not all that great.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kimchi Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kimichi-ramen">Kimchi Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
