There was never a good way of surfacing these keywords on posts without the UI getting more cluttered. So, I just left them in the background and used them to populated the previous and next related posts at the bottom.</p><p>After going through tons of old posts with the Site History and again going through posts for the Photo Collage page, I had the idea of creating a Word Cloud for all those keywords in the background. So, here it is, the <a href="/keyword" title="/keyword">Keyword Word Cloud</a> page.</p><p class='img'><a href="/keyword" title="/keyword"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250222_keyword/IMG_0483_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250222_keyword/IMG_0483_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250222_keyword/IMG_0483_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Click on a keyword to view all the posts associated with it.</p><p>All keywords have been alphabetically sorted on the page, and weights are determined by how many posts use those keywords and how recent the most recent post of that keyword is. The heaviest keywords have more than 25 posts with the most recent one made in the last 10 years. Size goes down a level by halving the total posts. Size also goes down 2 levels each 5 years behind that 10. Categories have been included, too, which makes up the bulk of the heavy keywords.</p><p>This page is nice because it can cover more fine-grain groupings of posts that I don't want to set up with categories. I don't want a million categories of only 2 or 3 posts which will almost never have anything new. But, a million keywords? Yeah sure! Let it rain!</p><p>This has also been good to grouping posts of a single vacation, like when friends visit or when I go off somewhere. I'm still working on going through some old photos, so more old posts should pop up over time, until I burn myself out.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Photo Collage Page" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/photo-collage-page">Photo Collage Page</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In fact, displaying my artwork was the original purpose for creating my website in the first place. Over time, the purpose of my website changed. Photography became more important to me than artwork. Then, writing more focused content became more important.</p><p>I continue to take a lot of photos with my digital camera, but those photos are all attached to posts and only viewable at the bottoms of those pages. My writing is always put first.</p><p>So, I've made a page that puts my photos first: the <a href="/photo" title="/photo">Photo Collage Page</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="/photo" title="/photo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From here, you can view all the photos I've marked as important or significant. You can click into them and view the corresponding post if it's available, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Diamond Grid Photos</b></div><p>The photos on the Photo page have been individually selected by me, after sifting through most of the over 20,000 images available on the site. While going through photos, I noticed there were many photo galleries in the directory that didn't have blog posts associated with them. Over time, I will add these posts to the site with the attached images.</p><p>I have already added a few of these posts. In particular, I added 2 major clusters of posts. The first cluster was my 2011 trip to Japan with my brother. We traveled around the Kansai region going to Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and few other cities. The second cluster was my 2014 trip to Okinawa. I visited many war sites and met up with my friend Justin while he was stationed there.</p><p>These posts are all back dated to when they took place. You can view them using their keyword pages: <a href="/keyword/osaka-2011" title="/keyword/osaka-2011">Osaka 2011</a> and <a href="/keyword/okinawa-2014" title="/keyword/okinawa-2014">Okinawa 2014</a>.</p><p>Because of these past posts, I have now surpassed 1000 blog entries on the site.</p><div class='title'><b>Single Photos</b></div><p>One of the pages I had on a previous version of my site showed off random photos of mine without any real context. These were singular photos that I thought looked nice, so I wanted to those photos on this page too. So, I added a new photo folder on the backend for single photos.</p><p>I still continue to take random photos with my camera or my phone when I'm walking around, so I'll continue to add nice looking photos to the Photo page as time goes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Updates</b></div><p>To match the diamond grid motif, image galleries on posts also have the diamond grid, replacing the original square grid. I might add more 45 degree angles in other places, too, to have more things match. We'll see, though. Keeping things simple around here is still important.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Site Design History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/site-design-history">Site Design History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It all started with Geocities as a portfolio showcasing work from art school. Then, my site moved to Tripod where I tried making a web comic. And then to its home here at theschlock.com posting game reviews and photos.</p><p>Lately, I came across some of my old pages, and I wanted to find a way to surface them again. The actual content is too personal (or problematic), so I couldn't surface the pages in their original form, so I decided to reuse the old designs with all the posts currently available on the site. </p><p>Prior to the current version of the site, I would count 8 distinct versions of my home pages over 4 clear eras of experimentation and learning. FYI, not all the links on these pages are available.</p><p><u>Geocities Era</u> / Microsoft Frontpage<br/>Version 0 - <b>Art Portfolio</b> (2000, or 1999?)</p><p><u>Tripod Era</u> / Microsoft Frontpage<br/><a href="/old/v1" title="/old/v1">Version 1</a> - <b>Original Version</b> (June 12th 2000 - April 2002)<br/><a href="/old/v2" title="/old/v2">Version 2</a> - <b>Updated Version</b> (April 2002 - January 2003)</p><p><u>Domain Era</u> / Macromedia Dreamweaver<br/><a href="/old/v3" title="/old/v3">Version 3</a> - <b>Experimental Photo Version</b> (January 2003 - February 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v4" title="/old/v4">Version 4</a> - <b>Clean Photo Version</b> (February 2003 - August 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v5" title="/old/v5">Version 5</a> - <b>Framed Photo Version</b> (August 2003 - June 2005)<br/><a href="/old/v6" title="/old/v6">Version 6</a> - <b>Movable Type</b> (August 2003 - August 2006)</p><p><u>Wordpress Era</u><br/><a href="/old/v7" title="/old/v7">Version 7</a> - <b>Wordpress</b> (August 2006 - March 2014)</p><p><u>Current Era</u><br/><a href="/site-design-history" title="/site-design-history">Version 8</a> - <b>Tapestry / Java</b> (March 2014 - present)</p><div class='title'><b>Origins</b></div><p>The Internet was an absolute marvel to me. Everyone was spreading out on the net and carving their own corner of it for themselves. Everyone had their own website for their art, for their stupid movies, for their forums, for their ideas. I was in art school, so I wanted to be like all the other artists online, showcasing their stuff. Too bad I was a terrible artist.</p><p>I had no idea how to actual make a webpage. I don't remember the details, but it seems like I downloaded Microsoft Frontpage, which generated the code of my original pages, and put together a design based on other pages I liked. Geocities and Tripod offered free hosting, so I put it there and linked to other people's pages.</p><p>Version 0 - <b>Art Portfolio</b> (Geocities, 2000)<br/><a href="/old/v1" title="/old/v1">Version 1</a> - <b>Original Version</b> (June 12th 2000 - April 2002)<br/><a href="/old/v2" title="/old/v2">Version 2</a> - <b>Updated Version</b> (April 2002 - January 2003)</p><p>(Note: I am unable to retrieve any Geocities data at this time, so I'll try to revisit it later.)</p><div class='title'><b>Domain</b></div><p>After art school, I went to a real school and started learning programming. I started meeting more people who also cared about making an online presence for themselves.</p><p>November 2002 was when I bought theschlock.com. Also, for that Christmas, I got my first digital camera, and starting taking tons of photos. I wanted to make a site that used my photography more in its design and showcased photos. I started going to more clubs, and wanted to put those photos online, too. I started thinking about having a multipage design, rather than a single landing page with links.</p><p>I found Macromedia Dreamweaver online which was WAY more user friendly than Frontpage. I could actually edit things in a design view and move them around. It gave me more freedom. This really helped me develop a sense of web-design. I still had yet to fully understand HTML, but Dreamweaver had both design views and code views, so I could watch the code change as I moved things around. After a while, I could take off the training wheels and write the code myself.</p><p><a href="/old/v3" title="/old/v3">Version 3</a> - <b>Experimental Photo Version</b> (January 2003 - February 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v4" title="/old/v4">Version 4</a> - <b>Clean Photo Version</b> (February 2003 - August 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v5" title="/old/v5">Version 5</a> - <b>Framed Photo Version</b> (August 2003 - June 2005)</p><p>I messed around with some designs and eventually landed on the last one. </p><div class='title'><b>Blogs</b></div><p>By the time I landed on that last design, I was living with friends and fellow students who were in web development at school. They also made their own websites, and quite knowledgable about all things Internet. Blogging software started becoming an actual business, and people had begun transitioning from completely custom hobbyist sites into Blogs.</p><p>Technology had changed too. Making website updates was no longer about directly editing HTML and uploading it. The underlying database would hold all the data, and software running on the server would generate the page. I didn't fully understand this. I had really only just grasped the top layer of web-dev.</p><p>One of my friends loved Movable Type, so I installed it on theschlock.com from his recommendation. I used it in tandem with the Framed version of the site. Moveable Type would handle all the long posts about games and whatever. The Framed version was updated with photos and pictorials.</p><p><a href="/old/v6" title="/old/v6">Version 6</a> - <b>Movable Type</b> (August 2003 - August 2006)</p><p>I used this site through the remainder of college.</p><div class='title'><b>Wordpress</b></div><p>Nearing the end of college, the Internet and blogging had matured. My site design was pretty "old" for the Internet and MovableType wasn't totally user-friendly to use. By then, Wordpress completely overtook all of independent blogging. </p><p>Prior to studying abroad in Japan, I downloaded my entire site locally and zipped it. I installed Wordpress on theschlock.com, which completely took over. Wordpress was WAY more user friendly than Movable Type, and I could easily write about everything I was doing in Japan, and show all my photos, too.</p><p><a href="/old/v7" title="/old/v7">Version 7</a> - <b>Wordpress</b> (August 2006 - March 2014)</p><p>I choose the design from a template, but then changed it slightly to be different. Not all that much, though.</p><p>After graduating, I still continued to use it. Working as a developer, I learned so much about using Java to manage and maintain websites, but I never had the headspace to use it on any personal projects. I had the time, but I already spent all day thinking about websites at work. I needed to decompress at home.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Version</b></div><p>That brings us to the current version of the site. </p><p>While Wordpress was far more user-friendly than my previous versions, it didn't feel special. It didn't feel like it was mine. Wordpress used PHP at the time, which I never liked. PHP feel far too loose and I couldn't understand it.</p><p>I had always wanted to remake everything from scratch and have complete control over everything on the site in a more modern capacity. I had started laying some initial groundwork in 2012. But then, after moving to Japan and settling in, I finally had the headspace to execute on my ideas completely. I knew exactly what I wanted and exactly how to make what I wanted.</p><p>I wrote about all this in the first post on this version of the site on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th, 2014</a> as the site went live for the first time. Around 2 months later, the full design was complete. I wrote about that <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start-2" title="/a-fresh-start-2">here</a>.</p><p><a href="/site-design-history" title="/site-design-history">Version 8</a> - <b>Current</b> (March 2014 - now)</p><p>It was the site I had always wanted. I had complete control over everything on the site, and it was extensible enough to have new things over time.</p><p>Running an active website isn't all that easy, though. It was always going down after a couple of days. I kept up with it for nearly 3 years. Then, one day, when I checked on it, the site was gone. Deleted from my host. My host had dropped support, so that was the end of that service.</p><p>2 years ago, with renewed programming interest, I finally brought the site back online, nearly 9 years after its initial launch. I posted about it on <a href="/old/v7/website-revival" title="/website-revival">March 9th 2023</a>.</p><p>Now, the online version of my site is a generated mess of static HTML files. Because of this, there should no longer ever be any problems with hosting in the future. There's nothing running on the host, nor any database it's pulling from. It is free from any technical problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>This design has changed and been refined a little bit over the years, but I doubt there will ever be another complete redesign of the site. The design still holds all the key values I want for written online content, and it's easy for me to add new things and change them.</p><p>Although...  Now that I have a framework for displaying my blogging content with different designs, I could experiment with new designs and see if anything sticks. Or, I could design terrible versions of my site in the same way that much of the blogging sites have turned into.</p><p>Revisiting many of these old pages has given me some new ideas, too, so stay tuned. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Today's Posts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/todays-posts">Today's Posts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.</p><p>With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen.

Toys R Us International had separated from its American parent prior to the Bain Capital purchase. So, if you're able to travel abroad, you can still visit one of my favorite stores of all time.</p><p>No place is this more true than Toys R Us Asia, the most successful branch of the international division, according to the Internet. In particular in Japan, you can easily find a Toys R Us store in most malls. However, directly north of Nagoya, just south of Komaki, along the road underneath the Nagoya Expressway is a special place.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp"></a></p><p>It's a rare standalone Toys R Us location, outside of the mall and other shopping centers. Here's the location in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/f2tKueDDLrjEzf1SA" title="https://goo.gl/maps/f2tKueDDLrjEzf1SA">Google Maps</a>.</p><p>This particular store is the Toys R Us that time forgot. From the outside to the inside, it's like stepping back through time 20 years. </p><p>All of the aisle fixtures and shelving are exactly the same as they were when I worked at Toys R Us from 1997 to 2000. Those fat heavy off-white metal shelves with three teeth that fit into the aisle. That off-white peg board in the back. The plastic covers hooked to the very top shelves for signage and concealing extra product.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp"></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Even though they are painted white, the peg hooks are identical as are all of the price labels on them. The rollers for the diaper rack are identical. Those metal price frames are the same too. The bike racks. The stroller aisle. They even had the old tickets for video game systems!</p><p>All of the prices were printed on white paper instead of yellow. But other than that, it's a near replica.</p><p>The check out lines were identical too, with the exception of the updated cash registers.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>It's pretty amazing how everything is still intact like it hadn't been touched in the last 20 years.</p><p>Again, of Japan's 150+ Toys R Us locations, 99% of them are located in malls and shopping centers. I'm pretty sure that the mall locations don't have the same shelves and aisle fixtures. At my Toys R Us (25 years ago), each section of the aisle with those shelves were 4 feet across. "Merchandise the aisle 4 feet at a time," the old manager would say. I should have brought a tape measure to check if these shelves were 4 feet, but it definitely seemed like it. Japan uses the metric system, so I'm guessing the locations in the malls use more standard Japanese shelves. They wouldn't have defaulted to 4 feet.</p><p>Looking at Google Earth, this Toys R Us was here in 2001, which was back before the International Division broke away from the American parent. Much like Costco does today, they probably manufactured all of these shelves, fixtures, and equipment in America and shipped it overseas. In the last 20 years, there was probably no reason to throw out all of this stuff in order to remodel.</p><p>This North Nagoya location feels like an island in many ways. It feels like an island in time, obviously. But there's nothing else around the area, either. You HAVE to drive to get here, and specifically drive to this location. With nothing else around, this isn't really an impulse stop. There's plenty of parking. The roof is a parking lot, too!</p><p>Despite my photos, many families still come here looking for toys, bikes, and other baby gear. It took me a while to get some photos without people. Actually, I never took photos of the bike area because there was always someone there. So, this location must still be pretty profitable. Makes sense if they're not actually spending any money updating the infrastructure.</p><p>I don't know if the trip to this location would actually be worth it, but if you have deep nostalgia for Toys R Us in the 2000s, and you happen to be driving north out of Nagoya, it could be worth a stop. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Website Revival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/website-revival">Website Revival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the Spring of 2014, I had finally built the website I had always wanted. Using the Tapestry framework and my web development experience, I wrote a site that could host all of my blog content I had written over the years and be extensible enough to easily change and build whatever I wanted into it. </p><p>I wasn’t manually building pages anymore, like I had been when I first made my website in 2003. My blog content wasn’t orphaned on another server, like when I moved to Movable Type in 2005. And, I was no longer stuck within the constraints of someone else’s design, like when I moved to Wordpress in 2006. </p><p>With my new website, I had built everything from scratch, which gave me complete full control over everything, which gave me the freedom to do anything. It was perfect.</p><p>Almost, anyways.</p><p>Tapestry is a very powerful framework, but for my particular setup at the time, it often crashed. Tapestry ran in Java, so to deploy the site on the Internet, it needed to be run in Tomcat. Once running Tomcat would serve the pages to whomever requested them. But, every two or three days, something within Tapestry or Tomcat would cause the site to be unresponsive. To fix this, I would turn it off and turn it back on again. Not a lot of people actually visited my site, so I don’t think anyone noticed.</p><p>For almost three years, things were pretty good. Though, as usual, my posting became less frequent and I stopped visiting my site as often as before. One day, when I power cycled my website, it was gone. There was nothing on my server. Apparently, a month or two prior, my web server had failed its migration. Well, whatever. All of my code was a mirror of what I had locally. I’ll just copy everything over again and start it up. Not so. My web server had also dropped Java and Tomcat support after this migration. No word about this at all. They just deleted all of my stuff, dropped support, but still billed me every month.</p><p>I looked around a little bit for a new web server. I tried one service, but I couldn’t get the site running. I continued to look around, but Tomcat support had become expensive for some reason. Maybe demand had dropped. I had thought about using cloud servers with Google which would homogenize my Internet eco-system further, but that was also more expensive that what I wanted. Also, it took me a while to figure out how to do it, and I was getting no where.</p><p>So, the site was dead.</p><p>In the last couple of months, I have been doing a lot of programming and using GitHub thanks to the Analogue Pocket. One day I saw that someone had “hosted” their blog on Github. Looking further, you could also have your web domain point to these pages and mask itself as a real website. </p><p>Oh shit. Could I do this?</p><p>GitHub is not a webserver, so it can’t run anything on the backend. Any webpage it hosts, would have to be static. Despite my website running Tapestry, almost all of my content is static. Yes, it uses a database, and Yes, the server is generating pages. But, the result is always the same. Anything that was dynamically generated from the server, could be changed to a separate page or rewritten in Javascript.</p><p>I had often thought that if I could simply make my website a huge mess of HTML pages, then I could easily find hosting and it would absolutely never crash or be inaccessible. And GitHub was answer, because not only could it host these html pages, but it could do it for free.</p><p>It didn’t take me long to find the command line program, WGET. When run, it will crawl through a website and save everything locally. It didn’t take me long to write a <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh">terminal script</a> to save my entire website in HTML into a GitHub directory that could push back to the Github to be hosted.</p><p>There were still some broken links, dynamic links that needed to be changed, and the image gallery that needed to be re-written. A few weeks later, those were all solved. I cleaned up some old posts, and removed some problematic ones from 15+ years ago. I'm also hosting images directly from Google Drive. Now, I’ve written a few new posts to cover some topics from the last year. There are still some posts that I haven't written yet. You can see that progress <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2">on GitHub</a>. I even made a custom <a href="/errorpage" title="/errorpage">error page</a>!</p><p>I think everything is good enough to consider my website reopened. :)</p><p>I first opened theschlock.com in August of 2003, so in just a few more months, it'll be the 20-year anniversary. My life has changed considerably since then, from college, to studying abroad, to working as a software developer, to moving to Japan and working in public schools, to now working in a private school. It's interesting to be able to look back and recall my thoughts during these times.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Car Mileage" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/car-mileage">Car Mileage</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is to ensure that the cars are still safe to drive and that they haven't been illegally modified. It's usually costs at least $1000, which is annoying, but it's even more annoying when you have a bunch of repair costs tacked on top of it.</p><p>When I arrived in Japan, I had to buy a car because public transportation up in the mountains was not feasible. The car mechanic in town had a pretty good deal on a 2004 <b>Subaru R2</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Subaru R2 is a Kei car, denoted by its yellow plate. Kei cars are smaller and have smaller engines. This also means they get some pretty great gas mileage.  I bought the car in 2013, but as <I>Shaken</I> loomed in 2021, the bottom plating had begun to erode away and it was no longer road-worthy. My mechanic information me that the repairs would be too much, and I should buy a new car. I had a bunch of money saved up from stimulus checks and not traveling due to lockdown, so it wasn't too bad.</p><p>My mechanic and I went through a bunch of cars on the open market, and I finally settled on a 2017 <b>Daihatsu Mira ES</b>. I wanted to continue owning a Subaru, but they discontinued their line of Kei cars, and Daihatsu has purchased their designs. The Mira is a slight evolution of the R2 mixed with Daihatsu designs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I went with Red to try and set myself apart from the conformity of all the White, Off-White, and Grey cars of Japan. Nobody likes colors in their cars over here. It's still not completely unique, though, as the Mira ES is one of the most popular Kei cars on the road. I think that's good because it'll be easy to find replacement parts in the future if stuff breaks. Also the mechanic can easily figure out how to fix it.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and I've finally made the final payment on my car. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Car Mileage</b></div><p>Whenever I pay for gas, I've gotten in the habit of writing down the Odometer on the receipt in order to calculate my own gas mileage.

| October 13, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month, the Analogue Pocket has continued to be an absolute monster. The Sega Genesis is now available. The Nintendo Entertainment System is now available. Sega GameGear is available, too. And there have been many cores of 1980s Arcade games released, too.</p><p>It's starting to get unwieldily, so I've created a collection of programs to help me organize and process games so they can be played on the Pocket.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils</a></p><p>I've been working on this pretty solidly for the past three weeks, and I think it's finally feature finished. The GitHub repository has straight forward information of how each process is set up and what exactly each process does. But, overall…</p><p>Pocket Utils is a collection of scripts and programs that do several things, including the following: (1) Process MRA files and Create Arcade Roms, (2) Create Library Images for sorted Games, and (3) Update Platform information for cores.</p><div class='title'><b>Process MRA Files</b></div><p>The Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, or MAME, on computer standardized how to emulate arcade games. When ripping games from their original boards, each component had their own file, and everything was put together in a zip file. </p><p>FPGA emulation of arcade games doesn't like this. The chip wants direct read access to the data it wants and unzipping a file in memory is extra useless overhead. Thus, the idea of a MRA file was introduced. A MRA file contains specific instructions on how each piece of the arcade board can be assembled into a single ROM file. This file is not compressed and allow free access to all the data the FPGA wants. </p><p>A separate program is required to process these MRA files, though. I use this <a href="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c" title="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c">MRA Tool</a> found in NullObject's GitHub. When an arcade core is released for the Analogue Pocket, it'll come with MRA files to create ROMs from ZIP files of arcade components. You must get the arcade ROM zips, process the MRA file in the program giving it the zip files, and then place the generated ROM into the core's folder on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>There are lots of steps to getting this to work, and many arcade cores released for the Analogue Pocket play multiple games. Some releases come with 10 or more games. In fact, arcade systems like Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 have as many as 300 variants of their games. Doing all of this manually is not feasible.</p><p>This program solves this problem.</p><p>Put all of your MRA files in the to-be-processed directory. Run the program. It'll attempt to download any and all ZIP files required to make the arcade rom, and store them locally. If the Arcade ROM is successfully generated, it'll copy it to the correct directory on the Pocket, and also copy the MRA file to the Pocket, too.</p><p>If it can't find the ZIP files online, you can manually search for them and put them in your local store. If a ROM was already generated, it'll copy over the MRA file anyway. If the MRA file is already there, it'll copy it to a duplicate directory.</p><p>With Standard games, everything works really well and there are almost never any problems. Problems usually only come up when trying to generate bootlegs or hacks of roms. Those often require extra steps.</p><div class='title'><b>Create Library Images</b></div><p>One of the most appealing features of the Analogue Pocket is the Library feature. </p><p>Something I've never liked about using emulators is having to choose the games I want to play from a list. It's so sterile and clinical. The Super Nintendo Mini was so amazing because of its visual presentation. You had a line games presented with their box art. And you could visually choose the game you wanted to play by selecting that box art.</p><p>The Library feature of the Analogue Pocket was just that. It gave you a visual list of all your games to select from. Further still, you could organize all of your games in Playlists. This was promised in Analogue's Tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888">Analogue OS</a>.</p><p>By default, the Analogue Pocket has an internal list of game data but it doesn't have an images. Early on, you could download an image pack that gave you all the title screens for every game. But I don't want title screens. I want box arts.</p><p>It took a little while to figure out, but the Analogue Pocket uses a CRC hash of the file to reference which image is uses in the Library. If you have a correctly sized PNG file, you can run it through <a href="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter" title="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter">DerTolleEmil</a>'s Image Converter and it'll give you a BIN file. Put this bin file in the correct folder named with the CRC hash, and it'll use this image in the Library.</p><p>So, my program goes a bit further with it.</p><p>In each of the folders for Consoles and Handhelds on the Analogue Pocket, I have the ROMs that I like sorted into genre folders. My initial "CreatePocketEntries" program will collect all of these games in my database. "CreateLibraryImages" will look at every game in my database and attempt to download the box art image from <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" title="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails">LibRetro</a> on Github. With this image, my program will resize it to the correct dimensions for the Pocket, convert the PNG image to BIN, name it correctly, and copy the file to the System folder on the Pocket.</p><p>Now, when using the Library, the image matches the box art. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Update Platform Information</b></div><p>Another thing that I collect in my database is Core information.</p><p>When a user chooses a core from the openFPGA menu on the Pocket, it lists certain information about itself, such as when the console or handheld was original released, who was the manufacture, and also the name and category of the core, too. All core developers are very particular about the accurate representation of the consoles, games, and their code, so this information is usually correct, but sometime it is not to avoid copyright and trademark violations.</p><p>In the database, it's easy for me to edit this information and also collect all the information into categories. My program will rewrite all of the information in the Platforms directory with what I have in my database. </p><p>Additionally, it'll create Platform Images using agg23's <a href="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process" title="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process">Platform Image Creator</a>. Any new images that I've made and placed in the processing directory will be converted and copied over.</p><div class='title'><b>Run the Updater</b></div><p>There is also a simple shell script that runs <a href="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility" title="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility">Matt Pannella</a>'s command line program with all of the settings that I like.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I use this stuff pretty often when new cores and new features are released, so there continue to be more updates. When Playlists eventually come to the Pocket, I'll have a new program to make those. I'm also working on another program that will make a list of games I have in my "unsorted" directories for each core.</p><p>The Pocket continues to be one of the absolute best gaming devices made, and being able to make all this stuff to organize games has gotten back into programming on the side. It's been pretty great. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Overview of the Japanese Language" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/overview-of-the-japanese-language">Overview of the Japanese Language</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| April 20, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Coming from English, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages on learn. It's so difficult to learn because nearly every aspect of the language is different. The words, the grammar, the ideas, the culture, and the way Japanese is used all differ from English. </p><p>In fact, the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" title="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">Foreign Service Institute</a> classifies Japanese as a Category IV language, which requires a minimum of 2200 hours of class time (88 weeks of 5-hour daily training) to achieve a General Professional Proficiency level. It is the Institute's high ranking, shared only by Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.</p><p>The best way to learn Japanese, and any language, is to be immersed in the language. Have daily contact with the language, and try to find a balance of using all four or five methods of communicating with a language. These four methods are: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Sometimes, people break speaking into two methods: speaking written or prepared words and speaking your own improvised thoughts. Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing is also the order of difficulty of performing them.</p><div class='title'><b>Listening</b></div><p>By being in Japan, listening becomes a daily routine. However, it can be easy to shut everything out and ignore what it said around you. In your native country listening to your native language, you can hear and understand everything around you. You are part of the public consciousness. In a foreign country with a foreign language, you're no longer able to naturally understand everything. You have to work at it. And work is often exhausting, which makes it easy to tune out others.</p><p>There's a lot to understand, and it's possible that there's some things that you'll never understand. But, as time goes on, you will have the ability to understand some things, and be able to connect dots to understand things. If you get in the habit of tuning out others, you rob yourself of the ability to naturally understand your surroundings. So, don't tune out too much. Make attempts at understanding.</p><p>When you hear common phrases, or sometimes when people talk with you. Try repeating what they say. This may seem stupid, but this is how babies naturally begin to learn languages. Which, also may seem stupid for you. Of course, as adults, we can also learn the rules of the languages and compare them with our own language. The combination of these two things will allow use to learn the language.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>Listening becomes the easiest method of communication in Japan because you have so many passive opportunities to practice. Writing is the most difficult because you are not only outputting what you know of the language, but you have to activity do it to get better at it. It takes the most work and time out of the others.</p><p>Unlike English with its 26 letters (or 52, including both upper and lowercase alphabets), Japanese uses three sets of alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana have 46 characters each. Kanji, on the other hand, has over 10,000. Although, there are hundreds or thousands of kanji that are outdated. High School graduates are expected to know the most common 2,000. The Genki books only go through about 320.</p><p>All three of these alphabets are used together. Take a look at this sentence:</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span></p></p><p>The first two characters are <span class='ja'>ジム</span>, katakana. Katakana is almost exclusively used for foreign words in the Japanese language. Both Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, so each of the characters have specific sounds that are said the exact same way wherever they are in the sentence, with a few exceptions. <span class='ja'>ジム</span> is my name, Jim, which is phonetically spelled.</p><p>The next two characters are <span class='ja'>先生</span>, kanji. In sentences, kanji are used for solid words, such as Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives. In this sentence, we have 3 words using kanji: <span class='ja'>先生</span>, <span class='ja'>店</span>, and <span class='ja'>行く</span>. <span class='ja'>先生</span> is <i>sensei</i>, or teacher. Combined with my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生</span>, it's used as a suffix to denote that I'm a teacher. Generally, non-casually, when referring to other people, you use a suffix with their name. <span class='ja'>店</span> is <i>mise</i>, or store. And, <span class='ja'>行く</span> is <i>iku</i>, or the verb, to go.</p><p>The other characters in the sentence (<span class='ja'>は</span>, <span class='ja'>に</span>, <span class='ja'>きます</span>) are hiragana. This is getting ahead of ourselves, but they are used in the sentence as particles and a conjugation. Using <span class='ja'>は</span>(wa) after my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生は</span> denotes that I'm the subject of the sentence. Using <span class='ja'>に</span>(ni) with shop <span class='ja'>店に</span> denotes the direction of the action. And, <span class='ja'>行きます</span>(ikimasu) is the present positive conjugation of the verb <span class='ja'>行く</span>, meaning to go.</p><p>Putting the meaning together: Jim goes to the store. (or Mr. Jim goes to the store.)</p><div class='title'><b>Hiragana and Pronunciation</b></div><p>Even though there are three writing systems, both katakana and kanji can be written in hiragana, which is the first alphabet we'll learn. Additionally, every hiragana character can be written in Alphabetic characters, which is where we'll start when learning words. This is called Romaji.</p><p>Let's go back to our sentence.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span><br/><span class='ja'>じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span><br/>jimu-sensei wa mise ni ikimasu</p></p><p>Looking at the sentence in Romaji can help with pronunciation. Each hiragana has a specific sound and pronunciation doesn't change based on spelling as in English. Here's all the Hiragana, with Romaji to the right.</p><p><div class="columns center"><div class="column"><span class='ja'>あ　い　う　え　お</span><br/><span class='ja'>か　き　く　け　こ</span><br/><span class='ja'>さ　し　す　せ　そ</span><br/><span class='ja'>た　ち　つ　て　と</span><br/><span class='ja'>な　に　ぬ　ね　の</span><br/><span class='ja'>は　ひ　ふ　へ　ほ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ま　み　む　め　も</span><br/><span class='ja'>や　　　ゆ　　　よ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ら　り　る　れ　ろ</span><br/><span class='ja'>わ　　　　　　を</span><br/><span class='ja'>ん</span></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">a <span class='ja'>　</span>i <span class='ja'>　</span>u <span class='ja'>　</span>e <span class='ja'>　</span>o<br/>ka<span class='ja'>　</span>ki<span class='ja'>　</span>ku<span class='ja'>　</span>ke<span class='ja'>　</span>ko<br/>sa<span class='ja'>　</span>shi<span class='ja'>　</span>su<span class='ja'>　</span>se<span class='ja'>　</span>so<br/>ta<span class='ja'>　</span>chi<span class='ja'>　</span>tsu<span class='ja'>　</span>te<span class='ja'>　</span>to<br/>na<span class='ja'>　</span>ni<span class='ja'>　</span>nu<span class='ja'>　</span>ne<span class='ja'>　</span>no<br/>ha<span class='ja'>　</span>hi<span class='ja'>　</span>fu<span class='ja'>　</span>he<span class='ja'>　</span>ho<br/>ma mi mu me mo<br/>ya<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yu<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yo<br/>ra<span class='ja'>　</span>ri<span class='ja'>　</span>ru<span class='ja'>　</span>re<span class='ja'>　</span>ro<br/>wa <span class='ja'>　　</span> <span class='ja'>　　</span>wo<br/>-n</div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Speaking in terms of English pronunciation, the overall Japanese language is based on 5 vowel sounds with a combination of the above consonants. The vowel sounds do not change when paired with other characters.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that ji, from my name <span class='ja'>じむ</span>, is not listed in the alphabet. There are certain characters that can take a <i>ten-ten</i> mark or a <i>maru</i> mark to slightly expand the alphabet. <span class='ja'>し</span>(shi) becomes <span class='ja'>じ</span>(ji).</p><div class='title'><b>Kanji and Readability</b></div><p>Note: Often students wonder, if you can write a sentence using only hiragana, a much less complex writing system, why ever use the other two? Why not write everything in hiragana.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span> vs.<span class='ja'>　じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span></p></p><p>Coming from English, it makes sense to write everything using a limited number of characters, but the overall readability of the kanji sentence is far higher than the second. In fact, I added spaces in the hiragana sentence to improve its readability, but you still have to read each character to understand the words. The kanji sentence doesn't even need it.</p><p>While we don't use Kanji in English, the idea of using symbols to form a familiar shape representing a word is not so foreign. We've been reading and writing English since we were children, and one of the natural passive techniques we've developed is recognizing a word purely based on its shape. As long as the shape of the word fits the pattern we're used to, we can read and understand the word immediately without looking at each of the letters.</p><p>Kanji works the same way. Once you know the meaning of the kanji, you don't even have to read the whole sentence. Because there are so many kanji, much of a sentence's ambiguity is also removed. When I say, "light" without any context, do I mean something that shines on to a surface or something that's not heavy? Much like English, Japan has words written in Hiragana the same way with different meanings. But when using Kanji, the meaning is clear.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Again, learning Japanese is not a simple process. Just takes things step-by-step. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. And, always try.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
