| April 19, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Culture shock is the overall swing of excitement and depression that comes with being in a foreign country for an extended period of time. Almost everyone has some form of culture shock, but it is different for each person and each person deals with it in different ways.</p><p>It can sometimes happen abruptly from a situation or incident, or slowly build from small problems over time. Sometimes, incidents of culture shock can happen immediately upon arrival. Other times, it might be months until feeling some kind of culture shock. For me, there have been two periods where I've lived in Japan, now and study abroad in college. Both circumstances for living in Japan were entirely different, so the conditions of experiencing culture shock were entirely different, too.</p><p>Either way, when living in a foreign country, culture shock follows 4 (or 5) overall stages and the overall graph of your steady mood usually looks like this.</p><p><canvas id="fullChart" /></p><p>Going up, then down, back up and eventually returning to equilibrium. The four main stages are <span class="rainbow_mag"><b>The Honeymoon Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_voi"><b>The Frustration Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_blu"><b>The Adjustment Phase</b></span>, and <span class="rainbow_gre"><b>The Adaption Phase</b></span>. The fifth extra phase is <b>The Reintegration Phase</b>, when returning to your own country.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Honeymoon Phase -</b></div><p>When people think of culture shock, they often think of it as something negative. But, the overall feeling of experiencing life in a new country is often met with excitement. There are so many new things to experience differently from your own country. New food, new buildings, new money, new people, new stores. If you're a fan of your new country, touching things that you've dreamed of for the first time is an amazing experience you'll probably never forget.</p><p>All of these new experiences raise your overall mood level, and we move up the curve.</p><p>If you're only in a foreign country for a short amount of time, especially on vacation or a very short study abroad, this is probably the only part of the curve that you'll experience. This was the case when I studied abroad. Every day felt like a vacation. Exploring Nagasaki and writing blog posts about it was an amazing adventure that had something new and interesting each day. I never experienced any cultural problems large enough to pull me down.</p><p>So, in short, the honeymoon phase is meeting differences in culture with joy and excitement.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Frustration Phase -</b></div><p>The shock phase is the opposite. This is what happens when meeting differences between your countries and cultures has problems. This is also what people think of when they hear, Culture Shock.</p><p>Again, this can happen gradually over the course of several incidents or perhaps even one big incident. Problems are caused by not really understanding what people are saying. Or by people not really understanding you. Problems are caused by something someone said or did that was different than what you expected. Problems are caused by someone putting you into a situation where you felt uncomfortable and you felt trapped. And problems are also caused by small differences in culture that annoy and bother you that built over time.</p><p>It's easy to feel alone when you're in a foreign country. People often describe this feeling as being put into a box. In a foreign country, you don't have the same comforts as your normal routine. If you have a problem, you may not have a way to comfort yourself. And often when seeking those comforts, you can't find an equivalent and often don't know how to ask for it. So, for any problems, you hide in your box and you wait for this feeling to pass. Or, you wait until you're back home.</p><p>Often as you recluse, anything foreign or anything outside of your normal will reinforce these feelings and put you further into a spiral you cannot break from.</p><div class='title'><b>Experience</b></div><p>Often when you're in a foreign country for a short amount of time, you probably won't have enough time for these problems to really build and hit you. And if you do have problems, you only have to wait until the end of trip. There's a fast-approaching light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>That doesn't mean it won't happen for short trips, but be prepared that it might. It really comes down to expectations. Making too many assumptions without verification often leads to problems.</p><p>Frustration and Shock is much more common to occur after several months of living in the country. After meeting with people and working with people, making friends, and hanging out, you begin to feel like you're accepted, and like you've become part of the society.</p><p>But, you are pushed away. Your friends or co-workers do something that clearly shows they do not truly accept you as part of their society. You're just the foreigner, and you'll always be the foreigner. Once again, you made an assumption that you thought was fact.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adjustment Phase -</b></div><p>The overall strategy of Culture Shock is not to avoid it, but learning how to deal with it. This is the adjustment phase. Much like frustration, the ways that people naturally adjust are different for each person, but there's always room to learn and try new ways of returning back to natural mood level.</p><p>Skipping to the punchline, the overall best way of adjusting and understanding the situation better is to talk about it. Talk with your co-workers and friends about why you felt uncomfortable. Talk to other foreigners about similar situations, how they felt and how they overcame it. By talking about it, I mean opening a dialogue and expressing ideas. By talking about it, I <b>do not</b> mean to confront them about what they said and try to teach them why it's bad. </p><p>On one hand, they could absolutely be out of line and did something worthy of being called on. But, on the other hand, within their culture, it could be a socially-accepted action. If you call them on it, you're only reinforcing your foreign divide between them, and possibly reinforcing their behavior. Often in these scenarios, it's up to you to change. It's up to you to ask others and inform yourself about why any misunderstandings may have happened.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Tricks</b></div><p>Above is the overall best way to adjust, but there are several tricks to help elevate your mood.</p><p>If you're being overwhelmed by too many things outside of your comfort zone, try to reconnect with things from your home country. It's a good way to feel like you're normal. Buy some foreign food from your country. Or watch a movie. Or visit somewhere that reminds you of home. Call your parents or call your friends back home. If you feel like an outsider, take a vacation and be an outsider, if only for a few hours or a day.</p><p>It's also pretty simple, but exercise. Exercise is a great way to mentally relax. Often as you blow off all of your physical strength through exercise, your mental strength will get exhausted, too. Then, you're able to move through your emotions and process them. Maybe meditation is your thing instead of exercise? Singing is fun, too.</p><p>Whether its food or exercise or singing, finding some way of centering yourself can slow or stop your downward fall, so you can begin the climb back up.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adaption Phase -</b></div><p>The Adjustment Phase course corrects your mood and brings your back up to normal, through the Adaptation phase.</p><p>The more you understand about your foreign country, the more you can understand about how you fit into it. When you can successfully apply that knowledge to your life, you feel like you've had a win. You feel like you've overcome a barrier and become closer to your new home. <b>This is your overall goal</b>. Overall understanding and adaptation isn't something that happens over night. It takes time, patience, and communication. And often new problems occur. </p><div class='title'><b>Reoccurrence</b></div><p>Culture Shock and frustration isn't a single event. It's often multiple events throughout your life in a foreign country that make you feel like a foreigner and not accepted. Once you feel you've adapted, it's not uncommon for something new and unknown to happen and bring you back down.</p><p>Also, it's not uncommon for people to cling to quick fixes or escape rather than truly reach out, communicate and understand the problem. If you hold on to grudges and problems, you will never fit in and you'll always be an outsider. </p><p>Ultimately, your goal is to fit in society as best as you can. You must adapt in some ways in order to do this. This doesn't mean losing part of yourself. It means gaining a new part of yourself. Gaining the ability to fit into both societies.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Reintegration Phase -</b></div><p>If you're in a foreign country to live forever, then adaptation is the goal. But most foreigners will eventually go back to their country, either for a trip or for good. Then, the whole cycle begins again, but often it can be more severe. This is The Reintegration Phase, also sometimes known as Reverse Culture Shock.</p><p>If you've adapted and integrated in your foreign country, now YOU are the foreigner when you return home. You are expected to pick up life exactly as you left it, but you are different. You've changed. You do things differently than before. You talk different than before. Your personality may have changed, too. Depending on the length of time you've been away, your country has changed, too.</p><p>If you've been integrated in your foreign country for a while, you can often forget what it's like to no longer have a foreign bubble around you. You suddenly instantly passively understand everyone and everything around you, whereas in your new country, you become comfortable in certain levels of understanding. </p><p>People make a lot of assumptions about you, too, because they don't see you as anything different than themselves. Adjusting is often a harsh reality of what you've left behind.</p><p>This is normal. But, you've been here before. Honeymoon phase, Frustration phase, Adjustment phase, and Adaptation phase. Do your best, and don't give up. Communicate, Exercise, and Adapt.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Virtual Tokyo Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/virtual-tokyo-marathon">Virtual Tokyo Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

To run them, you needed to download a GPS tracking running app, like Strava, and record a run with the same length as the race within the correct time period.</p><p>These virtual marathons became so frequent and so cheap that throughout 2021 I was running one nearly every weekend. In 2018, I set a new personal record in distance having run a total of 367km in official races over the entire year. I spent nearly $1000 doing this, too. In 2021, I ran 365.6km in all of my races combined, only spending $200. This was an absolute godsend, even though my race times weren’t nearly as good.</p><p>The Tokyo Marathon was a race that had been on my bucket list ever since I started running in Japan. Every year I applied, but every year, I was unable to win the entry lottery for general entry. Much like all other marathons, it had been canceled in 2020 and pushed to 2021. Then canceled again and pushed to 2022. </p><p>Finally, this year, the Tokyo Marathon was finally held again, but only for the elite and career marathon runners. There was no general entry. To make up for this, they added an online component. Anyone who had general entry in the race could participate online for free. Additionally, the general entry became open to everyone for 5000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>. This was finally my chance! Not only that, I only had to run a half marathon rather than a full.</p><p>On March 5th, in the yet still snowy country-side, I ran my half marathon and completed the race. The app was very cumbersome, and I wasn’t really sure if my time actually registered. But today! I got my medal in the mail.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Perhaps it is not a legitimate Tokyo Marathon medal, but it is good enough for me!

| April 8, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>With the world in lockdown, late last year I decided to look into what it would take to start streaming video games on the Internet. I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer from Amazon, and after a lot of tweaks, I have my stream running pretty well through OBS and broadcasting to Twitch. I've had a small following, too, so I've made a Discord to chat with people while I'm not streaming.</p><p>You can find me on Twitch here: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock">https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock</a><br/>You can join my Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK">https://discord.gg/...</a></p><p>These days I've been playing a lot of Let's Go Eevee on stream. In each stream, I hunt for Shiny pokemon and eventually I plan on collecting all of them. In order to make my streams more engaging, I have created a Chat Bot that has various games and activities. This is <b>Schock Bot</b>.</p><p>Schlock Bot is a locally run program. When it is active, it'll connect to Twitch and Discord. It will read every message in the Twitch chat and every message in the Bot channel on Discord. If a command appears, it will respond. It is written in Java with connections to MySQL. Recently, I retro-fitted Tapestry into it, so it will also host webpages, which I use as Twitch overlays.</p><p>On Git-hub, you can view all the current functionality and how to use it. For Twitch Chat, its main function is taking bets on which Shiny Pokemon will appear next in Let's Go. Also, there's a guessing game, which will give the Chat hints on a Pokemon. The first one to guess will get points!</p><p>You can view the entire project here: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot">https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot</a></p><p>It's been really fun getting back into programming. It is really satisfying that while building this thing everything really came together. And then being able to use it immediately on stream and have real people interact with it. It's great. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Plans</b></div><p>Rock blocks are always what slows down progress and kills motivation, though. Nearly everything I've been able to think of, I've been able to put into this, but there are 2 major things I wish to add that have not been working.</p><p><b>One</b>, I want to be able to listen for Channel Points redemptions and other Twitch notifications. Apparently you do this through Web hooks, but I haven't been able to get it working. With this working, I could automate a few things in the background rather than doing it manually.</p><p><b>Two</b>, I have Schlock Bot hosting web pages, which are connected in Twitch and displayed. But, again, I'm manually turning on and off their visibility. I want to make a host of other webpages that show the most recent followers and display graphics or play sound effects. I'm having trouble getting these pages working. There would need to be some kind of Ajax thing that would listen for a prompt, and then react accordingly.</p><p>With both of these things working, viewers could redeem points and have graphics show up on my stream or have a sound effect play.  Ya know, just like all the other obnoxious streamers.  Some day, this'll happen.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Toys R Us is Dead" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead">Toys R Us is Dead</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Now, 18 years later, my store has been closed for good. Obviously the rise of the Internet economy slowly chipped away at Toys R Us's market share, but the real death move began in 2005 when <b>Bain Capital</b> bought the company. </p><p>In 2005, Bain Capital and KKR bought Toys R Us for around $6.6 billion. In order to pay for this sale, that put up some cash, but they mostly shifted debt that they already owed into Toys R Us in order to cover the rest of the cost. In more detail, Toys R Us already had about $1 billion debt at the time of sale. Bain Capital and KKR payed $1.3 billion, and shifted $5.3 billion in debt into Toys R Us. As such, Toys R Us was now around $6.3 billion in debt and only valued at $6.6 billion. It was damn near bankrupt immediately. How is this legal? Or possible?</p><p>[ Citation: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/" title="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/" title="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/">https://www.marketplace.org/.../toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/</a> ]<br/>[ Citation: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea"> https://www.forbes.com/.../toys-r-us-is-how-bad-assumptions-create-failure</a> ]</p><p>Toys R Us was still rather profitable, and could still stand against other retailers. But with its monumental debt, any actual profits it earned went straight into paying off the debt. They could no longer grow, and had to downsize little by little, year after year to break even. Its market-share dropped. Its profits dropped. And Amazon, Target, Wal*Mart, and other retailers began to leave it behind.</p><p>By the way, Bain Capital did the exact same thing with KB Toys 10 years prior. In 2000, Bain Capital bought KB Toys, dumped all of their debt into KB Toys, KB Toys went bankrupt and liquidated all of its assets in 2009.</p><p>On March 15th, 2018, Toys R Us announced to all of its workers that all of its stores in US will be closed and sold.<br/><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803" title="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803" title="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803">https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803</a></p><p>Over May, June, and July, stores across the US liquidated all of their stock, including the Toys R Us I worked at in high school.

During the day, the moon moved in front of the sun and cast parts of America in darkness for a short time.  Total lunar eclipses are not so rare and seem to happen fairly regularly.  The website <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/">https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/</a> has a list of all their occurrences past and present.</p><p>Living in Japan, I’ve already seen one total lunar eclipse in <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon" title="/october-moon">October 2014</a>.  It was a beautiful and clear night, so the red, blood moon cast in the Earth’s shadow was in clear clear view.</p><p>This January, there was another total eclipse, which began around 8:30pm.  The weather was cloudy, but it was light with many breaks.  The moon was clearly visible in the sky.  </p><p>It was also cold cold cold.  It was definitely below zero.  Maybe -4?  I thought about driving to somewhere beautiful and open to view the eclipse, but it was just too cold for me to sit outside.  The moon was clearly visible from my apartment, so I simply set up my tripod in my kitchen, opened the window, and shot the moon from there.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the lack of indoor heating in Japan, the cold temperature indoors really made no difference.  My apartment usually feels like it’s colder inside than outside anyway.  It only lacks the wind.  Besides, sitting under a pile of blankets (as I usually do at home) would be warmer than sitting around outside.</p><p>Here was the schedule for the eclipse:</p><p>Penumbral begins - 7:50pm<br/>Partial begins - 8:50pm<br/>Full begins - 9:50pm<br/>Maximum - 10:30pm<br/>Full ends - 11:10pm<br/>Partial ends - 12:10pm<br/>Penumbral ends - 1:10pm</p><p>The penumbral is a partial shading or dimming of the moon as the Earth begins to eclipse the sun.

Starting this year, I'm an RPA, which stands for Regional Prefectural Advisor.  And as RPAs, one of the things we do is hold a Work Orientation seminar to give useful advice to the new people of our prefecture.  </p><p>I volunteered to give a presentation about lesson planning, and how I do lessons.  To prepare for this, I wrote out an entire transcript of what I planned to say.  So, that is the following text, though I changed a few things for it to read better.  This is similar to my <a href="/old/v7/writing-lesson-plans" title="/writing-lesson-plans" title="/writing-lesson-plans">previous blog post</a> about lesson planning, but this assumes the reader (or listener) has no knowledge of lesson planning, or classroom experience at all.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><div class='title'><b>Let's Begin</b></div><p>Hi there everyone.  My name is Jim, and I'm starting my 4th year as an ALT. </p><p>This session is about lesson planning with a little introductory about the classroom setup, and classroom flow, as well.</p><p>First, I'll talk about my background.  Next I have a handout for everyone.  It has two lesson plans that I wrote and have used on both sides.</p><p>The first real topic is about talking with your homeroom teachers about your upcoming lessons.  Next, I will actually explain the lesson plan format I use for the handouts.  Then we'll go through the flow of a typical English class for me.  And that's further broken up into 3 parts: beginning, middle, and end.  The next topic is about having a goal or purpose with your lessons.  And then, I will explain what ESA means.  More on that later.</p><div class='title'><b>My Background</b></div><p>Let me give you a little background about myself before I start my presentation.  This shall give you some proper context on where this information is coming from.</p><p>I'm not an education major.  I majored in Computer Science and Mathematics and worked for more than 6 years before coming here to teach English.  Prior to coming to Japan, I had no classroom teaching experience, no training, no real education, and absolutely no idea what I was supposed to do, or how to do it.  Even after I arrived and started "teaching", I still had no clue.  I have a feeling many new ALTs are in this exact same situation.</p><p>But, I did have one thing.  Prior to coming, I had signed up for an online TEFL course.  For those who don't know what TEFL stands for, there are two terms actually.  TEFL is Teaching English as a Foreign Language.  and there's TESOL, which is Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.</p><p>I signed up through ITTT or teflonline.net, which was advertised through the JET website.  You can get a discount by using your JET number.  I think normally it's $300, but you get a $100 discount.  </p><p>Before coming to Japan, I went through about half of the course.  I became too wrapped up with packing and moving my life to Japan, that I quit for the time being.  The first half of the course was about some theories, classroom management, and grammar.  Nothing really concrete.  As one ALT currently talking the course told me, it's very "Mickey Mouse".</p><p>After being in Japan for a few months, I decided to finish before the course expired.  The second half of the course focused on actually writing plans which is what I was already doing in my schools.  So, I was learning things I could immediately use, and could easily see the value in what I was being taught.</p><p>Overall, this presentation is about two things.  First, It's about the single most valuable thing I learned from my experience.  And it's about the single most valuable I learned from that course, and how I consistently use it when planning and writing my lesson plans.</p><p>But, before I explain that, I want to show and define what I mean by Lesson Plan.</p><div class='title'><b>Handout</b></div><p>These are two of my actual lesson plans I used for my classes.  Though, I recently rewrote it for clarity, and to reflect what I actually did in the class.  My original plan had too much going on to fit in time.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" /></a></div></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Just to note, I know this looks a bit daunting.  To be clear, you don't necessarily NEED to be this detailed when planning your lessons.  I do things this way for a couple of reasons.  I can talk about that a little bit later if we have time.</p><div class='title'><b>Talking with the Teacher</b></div><p>For every class I've ever planned and taught, I've written something similar to this.  Before I teach this class, I will make a copy, and give it to the homeroom teacher.  As I give it to them, I will explain and discuss the entire thing, so they know exactly what to expect when I come to their class.  I will go through the plan, bit by bit, and explain each action.  I explain what I will do, what I want them to do, and what I want the students to do.</p><p>This can be a problem for new ALTs that don't know a lot of Japanese as most homeroom teachers don't know a lot of English.  In fact, I have one homeroom teacher in particular that no only doesn't understand my English, but has trouble understanding my Japanese.  And really I can't understand a lot of his Japanese either.</p><p>But even for you guys that don't really know a lot of Japanese, I have some small bits of advice.  And perhaps the other RPAs could jump in too, if they have any advice.  </p><p>But 2 things:</p><p>1: Use simple English.  As simple and direct as possible.  And 2: Use a lot of gestures, to explain your actions.  In addition to gestures, drawing pictures and diagrams work really well, too.  These are the things I did before getting a lot more comfortable with the Japanese language.</p><p>Whatever you do, however you do it, <b>getting them to understand your plan is essential</b> for a successful class.  Again, I have some reasons.</p><p>1. This is a great way to practice how you intend to explain your games and activities to the students.  If you can't correctly and concisely explain and demonstrate your ideas to the teacher, most likely the students won't be able to understand it either.</p><p>2. Next, talking about your plan out loud, and trying to explain things to someone else, is a good way to figure out any problems you might not have thought of.  Also, the teacher probably has a good idea whether or not something will go well, or fail outright.  So, talking about things is a good way to iron out any problems.</p><p>And 3. Explaining everything to the homeroom teacher will allow them to jump in and explain things to the students when they have trouble understanding you.  </p><p>Talking about everything before class will allow you to teach the class together, rather than being there alone, or trying to figure out things in front of the students, and wasting class time.</p><div class='title'><b>Explanation of the Lesson Plan</b></div><p>So, let's go through it!</p><p>At the top are the schools and classes where I will use this plan.  The dates are empty.  I usually write those in when I make a copy for the teacher.</p><p>On the next line, first is the grade.  Next is the plan number, so this is my third "official" class with the sixth graders.  Next is the Lesson number, which refers to the chapter in the book.  Next is the class number for that lesson, so this is my first class for lesson 5.  And a quick descriptive title for the lesson.</p><p>Next is the grid.  The first column is the how many minutes I expect each part of the lesson to take.  Bolded numbers are for the section.  The second column is the activity for each row.  Underlines are for each section.  Next column is "Contents", which is a quick description of what we'll do during that part of lesson.  Next column is "ALT".  This is what the ALT will do during that part of the lesson.  Next is "HRT".  This is what the homeroom teacher will do.  Next column is "Goal" or "Purpose".  This is why you are doing whatever in the lesson.  And last is "Grammar" and "Vocabulary".  This is the words or grammar I intend to teach the students.  Sometimes I have a description or translation along with it.</p><p>On the bottom, I have a row for materials.  These are the materials that are needed for the classes.  For "ALT", this is what I will bring.  For "HRT", this is what I will need from the HRT for class.  And for "Students", these are things the students will use in class.</p><p>Underneath, is for homework.  This is something new I've been doing this year.  I usually assign something for homework every 2 or 3 classes.  So far, it's just been writing practice, or doing an interview with family members or other teachers.</p><p>Finally, at the bottom is a date.  This is essentially the version number for this plan.  It's the most recent time, I have updated it.  So, if I make changes, and have a bunch of print outs, I can tell which one is correct.</p><p>On the other side is a URL where you can get this plan online.  Though, I'm bit behind with that.  The idea is that if some teacher or ALT in the future comes across this plan, they can go online and find all the plans associated with this lesson, downloads for materials, and possibly a blog post explaining how well or how bad the class went using these plans, and how I could make it better.</p><p>Questions?</p><div class='title'><b>Flow of Class</b></div><p>The handout has two lesson plans written on it.  There's #3 and #4, so these are back-to-back.  Let me quickly go through how I used this plan in class, and how a typical class will operate.</p><p>I don't know if they mentioned this during Tokyo Orientation, or if we did during Life Orientation, but I think it'll helpful to reiterate it.  And if you haven't heard of it, it'll be good, too, because then you will know about what happens before you step into class for the first time.</p><div class='title'><b>The Beginning</b></div><p>First, the ninchokyu, or subject leader, will come to the front.  They'll tell everyone to stand up, kiritsu.  They'll say attention, or kyoutsuke.  Then they'll say the Japanese aim for the class, or they'll say, "Let's start English."  And then the class repeat, "Let's start English."  Then they say sit down, and every sits down.  Then the class begins.</p><p>For me, first is the greeting.  I'll say, "Hello everyone"  And then they'll reply, "Hello Jim" or "Hello Jim-sensei"  Some classes call me Mr. Jim.  One class called me Jim-teacher for a little while.  Only the foreign kid calls me Mr. Hendricks, which is really weird, and I don't like it.  Then the teacher greets the class, and they reply.</p><p>Then we do questions.  I always do, "How are you?" and have the students reply with as many unique answers as possible.  Then it's "What day of the week is it today?"  Then "What is today's date?"  Then "What time is it?"  And then "How is the weather?"  For some reason, junior high schools ask these questions at the start of every class, so I try to do the same for elementary, so they already know everything.  In 5th grade, I teach the days of the week.  And 6th grade, I teach the other 3.</p><p>After that, I will place today's plan on the board using these cards.  And these cards correspond to the terms in the "plan" column of the lesson plan.  I will show each card to the class, and they'll repeat the word on the card.  They'll also see the meaning underneath.  Then I'll place the cards on the side of the board, so it's always visible in class.  This is so the students know exactly what's going on in class, and what's coming next for today.  As another RPA pointed out, this is also a great way for the teacher to keep track of class too, and not get lost.</p><p>I do this every time.  During this part, many of my students have memorized all of these words and want to guess my plan. So, they start yelling out what they think the next card is.</p><div class='title'><b>The Contents of the Plan</b></div><p>Then we'll go through the plan set on the board.  And actually, my following description of this plan is almost exactly how I describe the plan to the homeroom teacher of the class.</p><p>First is reviewing lowercase, which was the contents of the first two lessons.  And it's quick quiz, showing them the letters and asking, "What's this?"  I'm doing this with the whole class, but it would probably be better if I quizzed individual students.  But I don't want to spend too much time doing it, because it won't be used in the rest of the lesson.</p><p>For Today's Aim, I will write that aim on the board, and then ask students to try and read it.  Some students can, but most can't.  I'll ask them to repeat after me, and then we'll try and translate it as a class.  All of my aims begin with "Let's", so all my students know what that means.  Some students can figure out other words, and closely guess the Japanese meaning.  But eventually, I'll just tell them what it means.</p><p>It took me a long time to get comfortable using Japanese in class, or really even knowing enough Japanese to be used in this way.  This is the kind of thing that your homeroom teachers should be doing in class, so if you don't really know Japanese, or aren't comfortable with it, please ask the teacher to help explain any English you want to students to know.</p><p>My students know how bad my Japanese is, so they correct me a lot when I mistakes in class.  But they can almost always understand what I'm trying to get across.  Though, as a rule, you aren't supposed to use Japanese with students, since they're learning English.  But...  that's another topic, we can talk about later.</p><p>Anyway, next on the plan, I'm passing out the homework sheet to students with all of the flags I intend to teach, along with the English name written next to it, and space for them to practice writing.  This is not for them to practice writing in class, it's for them to try and read the English name written on the sheet.  Writing practice is for homework.  Again, there's another rule that says elementary schools are to focus on communication in class, never on writing since that comes later in junior high.  Again another topic we can argue about later.</p><p>And then the HRT and I introduce the flags to the students, and I ask them for the English name.  They can try to read, but I eventually tell them what it is.  And then they repeat it after me.  The book only teaches 10 countries, but I bumped that up to 18 because it was too easy otherwise.  Most students already know the names.  Also, for some students that have problems at English, I mention to them that they can write the Katakana pronunciation on their worksheet, if they can't remember the words.  Doing this is yet another debated topic for another time, but really only a few of my students actually do it, and it does help them quite a bit.  I never do it for them.</p><p>After all these flashcards are on the board, then we practice them again all at once.</p><p>For the grammar, I write the English on the board, and ask them to try and read it.  Some can.  Then we practice speaking the grammar as a class.  I will ask them what they think it means in Japanese.  And then write the Japanese on the board, explaining each of the parts.</p><div class='title'><b>Activity - Keyword Game</b></div><p>For the activity, we'll do the keyword game.  This is another one of my go-to games that the students really enjoy.  You can read the description on the plan, but let's go through the setup.  First, students make pairs with their partners, and place an eraser between them.  For each round, I will choose a keyword from the vocabulary.  Students will try and listen for that word.  When they hear it, they'll try to grab the eraser faster than their opponent.</p><p>I modified this game a little bit to have more grammar, and be a bit more complex.  First the students will ask the question, "Where do you want to go?"  I will reply with "I want to go to ____."  If they don't hear the keyword, then they'll repeat that phrase.  And then ask the question again, and continue the round until they heard the keyword.</p><p>Let's Play!</p><p>As you can see on the sheet, first we'll explain the game, though I frequently do this game, so some students know it by name already.  Then we play the game.  This game and others with similar setups are extremely great.  They have very little setup, and you can finish them at any time.  But even though, they're great to fill time, they are extremely repetitive, so you don't want them to go on long.</p><div class='title'><b>Finishing Class</b></div><p>Finally, to close class, I have evaluation.  Many teachers have their own goofy names for this.  The first teacher I worked with called it "Good Job Time" so I've been sticking with that since.  There's probably a better name for it, but whatever. It's fine.  During evaluation, I will choose a student who I thought did really well.  And then the homeroom teacher will choose another student.</p><p>The student I choose is someone who could complete goal, and could also accomplish the 3 points I have listed on the side.  The student had a <b>good smile</b>.  The student made good <b>eye contact</b> with their partner during conversation.  And they used a <b>clear or loud voice</b> that was easy to understand.  </p><p>This lesson kinda sucks for that because the students didn't really communicate with each other.  It was all repeating and listening.  For this class, I would probably choose a student was paying close attention to what I was saying, and really tried to get the pronunciation correct for the countries.  Or used a really clear loud voice during the game.  Or perhaps, I'll choose a student terrible at English, but who really tried their best, and made some small improvement.</p><p>Whatever the reason, I make sure to clearly say why I choose this student, and what they did during class do deserve today's honor.  There's really no point in doing evaluation if you randomly choose a student, and the class has no idea why they were chosen.</p><div class='title'><b>Taking and Assigning Leads</b></div><p>One last thing about this plan.</p><p>If you take a look at the plan, I have these certain sections marked with an asterisk.  That is to indicate the lead for that part of the lesson.  So, for passing out the homework, I will take lead.  Then the homeroom teacher will take the lead introducing and explain the country flags.  Then I will lead the repeating part of the lesson.  And then it will go back to the homeroom teacher, and they'll take over introducing and explaining the grammar I want them to learn.</p><p>In theory, this is how I want to class to work, but in practice it never really works that way.  Again, this comes back to communicating with your teacher.  A lot of teachers are quite shy about the English that they know.  I'm sure many of you can relate with your Japanese skills.  For example, when I first came to Japan, I knew some Japanese, but I was not comfortable at all with what I knew.  I would never speak in public with it because I was way too shy and self-conscious about it.</p><p>So understand that the homeroom teachers are in the same situation.  They have to help teach students in a subject they barely even know themselves.</p><p>My supervisor has instructed me to actually push these teachers into using their English more, but in a lot of cases, I end up doing most of the asterisk points, and the homeroom teacher hangs back, and helps out with any Japanese.</p><p>So anyways, that's the whole plan.  Any questions?</p><div class='title'><b>Having a Goal or Purpose</b></div><p>Having a Goal or Purpose is an essential part of any lesson plan.  This is for you to explain why you are doing what you are doing.  And this can help you get rid of non-essential crap that might just be wasting class time.  </p><p>This will also help you design an overall idea and plan not just for this single class, but for the entire lesson as a whole.  Again, this is class #1 for this lesson.  All other classes for this lesson to follow will build upon what I teach in this class.  Likewise, the things I teach in class #2 will continue being used in the lessons after.</p><p>I think the technical term for this is called <b>scaffolding</b>.  First, you need to clearly establish the basics.  Then expand on those basic concepts, by adding in the necessary complexity, a little at a time.  Once you have established everything, you need to use these concepts, and end the lesson in a meaningful and satisfying way.</p><p>When I think about planning lessons in this way, it reminds me of basic storytelling where you have a beginning, middle, and end.  In the beginning, you're introduced to the characters and everything is laid out in a simple way.  In the middle, shit happens.  This is where things start to get a little complicated, but interesting.  And the end is where all the complications come together in a meaningful and satisfying way.</p><p>The Departed is a fantastic example of this.  Same with Fight Club, Breaking Bad, and Lost (maybe).</p><p>As a concrete example of this, you may have noticed that even though this is my third class for my sixth graders, I'm already doing Lesson 5.  This is because my end goal for this lesson, or it's <b>ultimate activity</b>, so to speak, was to interview foreigners during their school trip at the end of May.  I wanted to get them interested in other countries in the world, and then come face to face with those people.  And I wanted them to learn questions they could ask these foreigners, and use those communicative skills in real life, rather than confines of their classroom.</p><p>I actually have another document that partially describes this arc.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These are my first 5 lesson for the sixth graders.  First we did the lowercase letters, and then we have the countries.  Here is #3.  There's a quick review of letters, then introducing the countries.  Quickly introducing some grammar, then practicing it.  Next class, #4, review countries, introduce more grammar, and then practice that grammar.  But here, they're also learning about the countries.  Last one, #5, review countries, review grammar.  There's a quick listening activity.  And then we're doing a full interview, where students each other, "Where do you want to go?" and the other stuff.</p><p>Before their trip, I had 3 more classes which taught them more specific words and phrases they could use with foreigners.  First class was the teaching.  Second class was practicing.  And the third class, some students pretended to be foreigners, and the others interviewed them.  And then they switched.</p><p>For two of my schools, it was a huge success.  They took a lot of photos of themselves with the foreigners they met.  For the next 3 lessons after that, we talked about the kinds of people they met, and then they made posters about their favorite countries, and presented them to the class.</p><p>Overall, we spent 9 classes for Lesson 5...  which is a lot.  But it was worth it.</p><p>Anyway, that is the single most important thing I've about learning planning from my experience so far.  Think about your lessons like a good story.  Have a beginning, middle, and end.  Start simple, and build on that to a meaningful ultimate end.</p><p>Any questions?</p><div class='title'><b>ESA - Straight Arrow</b></div><p>But, the most important thing I learned from that TEFL course is how to do that within a single class.  And that is ESA.  ESA stands for Engage, Study, and Activate.</p><p>- E - Engage - S - Study - A - Activate</p><p>Shane is an education major, and he has fancier terms for these things, but I think these are easier to remember.  If you look at my lesson plan, those sections are renamed to Review, "Today's Aim", and Activity.  </p><p>The Engage stage gets the students active and involved in the lesson.  Many homeroom teachers that do the lesson planning use something called "ALT Time" where the ALT just talks about something referring to the lesson.  For example, today's class is about numbers, so please say numbers 1 through 10 in different languages.  Or, today's topic is about gestures, so show the students some gestures from your country.</p><p>I use the Engage stage for students to remember and use the contents of previous lessons, especially contents that we will build on and use in today's class.  Then we're all on the same page, and can continue to the next phase: Study.</p><p>The Study stage is the part of the lesson that teaches new things to the students.  For this part, I will write "Today's Aim" on the board in English, and explain the goal of today's class.  I will teach new words, or new grammar, or new ways to use the words or grammar they already should know.  I will explain things, and we will practice together as a class.  If we have time, I'll have them practice with their partner, too.</p><p>Next is the Activate stage.  This is where students get to use the language that has been taught to them.  I plan some kind of activity that allows for that.  Like for class #1, we're doing the keyword game where students practice speaking the vocabulary and some quick grammar, as well as listening and identifying vocabulary words.  Class #2 that activity is also more practicing and repeating.  Though, I think that activity is still within the Study phase, as it's teaching them about various countries.  My third class activity with very much an Activate Stage, though, as students interviewed each other, and they answered where they wanted to go, what they wanted to see, and what they wanted to eat.  Students could answer whatever they wanted, or chose from a list.</p><div class='title'><b>Predictability v Consistency</b></div><p>I would say 95% to 99% of all my classes use the straight arrow, Review-Study-Activity pattern.  Using the same pattern over and over again provides the students with a consistent model for class.  Consistency provides a safe and comfortable model for the class that the students and teachers subconsciously learn and expect.  They know exactly what your classes are about, and no longer have to worry, on any level, about the structure of class.  They can focus purely on the contents of what you actually want them to learn.</p><p>Predictability and Consistency are really just two sides of the same coin.  Though, it's always a good idea to change some things around to keep the students active, and test their abilities in different circumstances.  Don't feel constrained by any structure you've built. </p><div class='title'><b>Why I write lesson plans this way</b></div><p>There are numerous benefits to writing such detailed plans for your classes.</p><p>Back in the "Taking with the Teacher" section I mentioned that it's a great way to completely think through all the details of your lessons.  This irons out any problems you might think will happen during class, or during your activity.  You can think about how you will explain things to students, and the exact steps you think you'll need to accomplish your goals.  How will I do this?  What materials will I need?   What do I need the HRT to do to help me?  What do I need from the HRT to do this?  It's best to think about all these before class, rather than during.</p><p>Additionally, writing plans like this make you look more professional.  It brings you credibility, and makes you more of an equal among the teachers you will work with.  When they see the amount of work you've done planning and preparing a class, they will definitely listen to you more, and trust you with what's going on.  It shows that you're taking your job seriously and aren't slacking off, or doing the minimal amount of work to get by.  It shows that you're part of their team, and really do care about the education of your students.</p><p>And, also, writing plans this way is a great way of putting down all your thoughts on the lesson into one place, so you don't have to remember every detail about every lesson yourself.  I teach about 12 elementary school classes each week, and my schedule can be all over the place.  There's no way I can keep all those details in my head at a time.  Every morning, I can look at my plans for that day, grab all the materials I need from the list on the plan, and read everything over to make sure I don't forget a thing.  I can double check things during class, too.</p><p>It's the same case for the HRT, too.  They can look over their copies of the plan, and remember their role, and everything they need to do.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>This is how I write my lesson plans, and my entire thought process about doing all of this.  It's the structure I've built to bring more meaning, and structure to my life as an ALT, and I've received many benefits from it.  I hope you able to take some pointers from the way I do things, and find your own structure that works for you.</p><p>Again, most ALTs don't do things this way at all.  This whole construct is something that is very much "me" so I don't expect anyone to look at this, and do things exactly this way.  It's important to find your own structure, and your own patterns, build them, perfect them, and share them with other ALTs.</p><p>I hope I was able to point in a direction that works for you.  Thanks. :D<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nakagawa Half Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nakagawa-half-marathon">Nakagawa Half Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I came across this marathon by browsing through <a href="http://runnet.jp/" title="http://runnet.jp/" title="http://runnet.jp/">runnet.jp</a>, Japan's premiere website for signing up for marathons.  (Very similar to active.com in the states.)  Unlike the Takaoka Marathon, which I've "run" twice now (<a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">Nov 18th, 2013</a>, <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2" title="/takaoka-marathon-2" title="/takaoka-marathon-2">Jun 18th, 2014</a>), this was much more laid back and treated as a community event, rather than an athletic competition.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" /></p><p>They actually had a marathon expo prior to the event where people could do packet pick-up.  I was unable to make it there the day before, so I went the morning of the marathon.  Packet Pick-up was quite smooth.  With each packet, you could enter a raffle to win several local goods.  I won an apple.</p><p>Inside the packet was a bunch of advertisement, and coupons.  Also included is the marathon "program" which includes a list of ALL participants.  The Takaoka Marathon did this, too.  Looking through the list, I was one of only 3 or 4 foreign participants, out of the entire ~3000 person list.  They gave out 2 bibs, too.  The front one contains the timing chip.  The back one shows which prefecture you've come from.</p><div class='title'><b>Opening Ceremony errata</b></div><p>On the day of the race, the expo was open from 7:00am to 8:20am.

Gravity does most of the work. :)  But, it was still too congested to actually glide down the hill.

Bleh…</p><p>On top of that, the course zig-zags around the rice fields, rather than going in a straight line.  It's somewhat demoralizing when a course doesn't take the most efficient route.

Seeing the course here is way more rewarding rather than seeing it near the middle of the run.</p><p>Only a short kilometer or two remaining, until crossing the finish line.

Continuing back to the expo hall, you could take some bottled water, fruit, and other post-race food.  Like an actual marathon back in the states!</p><p>Overall, I really liked this race.  It went through some beautiful scenery, and with the 3 hour limit, there were many more casual racers, rather than a legion of athletes.  The race was nice and casual, and was very fun.  This race was the most like any marathon I've done back in the states.  Very positive, and fun.</p><p>I'll definitely do this again next time.</p><p><u>Update (June 25th):</u>  Man.. I have been 100% sick since doing this race.  I've been coughing every day, and my lungs are constantly full of flem.  Ech.  I most've inhaled pollen or dust or something airborne during this race that has ruined my lungs. :(<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Installing a USB CD Changer" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/installing-usb-cd-changing">Installing a USB CD Changer</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Unfortunately, it was missing one important thing that I really love about modern cars:  a direct AUX input for the car stereo.  Using this, I could connect my phone to the car stereo and play music, rather than having to worry about CDs, or the radio.</p><p>I looked around online for ways to accomplish this in my situation.  I don't remember the exact path of links, and research, but I eventually came across this <a href="http://www.danbp.org/w/Installing_an_USB/SD/MP3/Aux-in_adapter_on_the_Suzuki_Jimny_OEM_Radio" title="http://www.danbp.org/w/Installing_an_USB/SD/MP3/Aux-in_adapter_on_the_Suzuki_Jimny_OEM_Radio" title="http://www.danbp.org/w/Installing_an_USB/SD/MP3/Aux-in_adapter_on_the_Suzuki_Jimny_OEM_Radio">article</a> on a blog by Daniel Brooke Peig.
