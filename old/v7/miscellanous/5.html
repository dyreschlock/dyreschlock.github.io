| March 13, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been nearly 10 years since I ordered Fried Rice at a local Asian restaurant, looked at all the obvious ingredients in the pile of food, and thought to myself, "This does not look difficult to make on my own."  Fried Rice is one of my favorite foods, and it really seemed like all I needed was some vegetables, eggs, rice, and soy sauce.  I bought a Rice Cooker, a gigantic pan, and the ingredients.  And it really was just that easy.  Vegetables first, add eggs, add rice, add soy sauce.</p><p>It's pretty much my "go-to" meal in the kitchen, and over the past 10 years I've come up with some good combinations of ingredients and sauces that compliment each other pretty well.  I started experimenting with some new ingredients over the past few months, and the results have turned out pretty well.</p><p><b>Squash</b> (particularly Acorn Squash) seasoned with a little honey and pepper makes for a bold flavor all around.  Fried <b>tomatoes</b> add a rich earthy, flavored tone to the mix.  And <b>cucumbers</b> are damn refreshing in almost everything you mix them with.  So, I decided to mix all 3 together and see what would happen.</p><div class='title'><b>Ingredients</b></div><p>Overall Ingredients include rice, eggs, tomato, cucumber, acorn squash, onion, and red pepper.  Along with a little butter, some balsamic vinegar, some honey, pepper, oil (in this case canola oil), and soy sauce.  For soy sauce, I'm using a combination of the citrus stuff, Ponzu, and some organic brand.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp"  /></p><p>Before doing any of the cooking, we need to prepare the rice, and the squash.</p><p>Overall, the amount of ingredients I'm going to use should feed about <b>4 people</b>, or 2 super hungry people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rice Preparation</b></div><p>The rice is pretty damn easy.  I used 2 cups of rice this time since I was cooking for more than just me.  Be sure to wash the rice thoroughly to remove any dust and dirt that has collecting in the bag.  Clean rice gives a totally pure taste.  If you don't wash your rice, it ends up tasting somewhat muddy, and tainted.</p><p>Anyway, 2 cups of rice, add the proper amount of water, and shove that into your rice cooker.  It usually takes about 40 minutes.  Rice cookers are pretty nice.  Most modern rice cookers will automatically switch to a warming mode, so you can keep your rice sitting in there for almost a day later.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp"  /></p><p>I've had my rice cooker since studying abroad in Japan, and I have found it VASTY superior to any western/American made one I've had in the past.  Most American models are designed to make 5+ cups of rice at once, but totally fail if you want to make a single cup of rice.  You can find a lot of the Japanese models on Amazon, totally in English, if you're interested in getting a really good one.</p><p>Here's the exact model I have, but in English : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24" title="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24">Sanyo ECJ-S35K</a></p><p>Or, you can just skip the rice cookers, and make rice the old fashion way with a pot on the stove.  But rice turns out perfect every time with mine, even after 5 years.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9663.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Acorn Squash Preparation</b></div><p>For Acorn Squash, I prefer baking them.</p><p><b>1. Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees</b>, and actually WAIT for it to get to 400 degrees.  Usually, I just turn it to 400 degrees and then throw them in there, but the low heat will quickly dry out the insides of the squash.  It must be exposed to the full heat in order for it to actually cook, and turn out perfectly.</p><div class='title'><b>2. Cut your Squash straight down the middle.</b></div><p><b>3. Remove all the seeds</b> with a spoon, and, basically, hollow it out.  You could save the seeds, and cook them separately if you like. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9653.webp"  /></p><p><b>4. Coat the exposed areas with some butter.</b> The butter is mostly used to keep the surface of the squash from drying out too quickly before it actually starts cooking.  The flavor is a nice touch, but there are probably slightly healthier options.</p><p><b>5. Cover the rim with a tiny ring of honey.</b> This also keeps the surface wet while cooking, but adds a sliver of sugar for kick.</p><div class='title'><b>6. And add a tiny couple of drops of Balsamic vinegar.</b></div><div class='title'><b>7. I put a little pepper in there, too.</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9654.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9654.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9654.webp"  /></p><p>I think I added just the right amount.  That may look like a lot, but that's because the angel is a little different in both pictures.  You could add as little, or as more as you like.  Or, you could add any other ingredients you want.  I try to avoid adding salt, as we'll be adding soy sauce to everything later on.  And too much salt is not really good for you.</p><p><b>8. Put that pan in the oven (fully heated for 400 degress) for about 45 minutes.</b> Or until the squash is nice and gooey.</p><p><b>9. After the time is up, remove the squash from the oven.</b> After it's done, it might look a little like this.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9655.webp"  /></p><p>All that residue collected in the squash can be removed because it's basically just sugary waste at this point.</p><div class='title'><b>10. Remove all the yellow gooey squash from it's disgusting outer shell.</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9656.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Fried Rice Recipe</b></div><p><b>1. Add a bit of oil to your pan.</b> Not too much, as the calorie count climbs pretty fast with the more you use.  With this recipe, use about a tablespoon's worth.</p><p><b>2. Flip the stove top to about a 6.</b> I'm using a gas stove, so 6 is pretty powerful as is.  With drier ingredients, I tend to use more heat.  But with several wet ingredients I want to slowly burn off the liquids and let them soak into the mix.</p><p><b>3. Dice up a tomato, and toss it into the pan.</b> The tomato should go first because it's the wettest ingredient, and needs a little more cooking than the rest.  Let it settle for a little while and burn off some of the juice.</p><p><b>4. Dice up some onion, and add that.</b> I only used about a quarter of that onion shown above.</p><p><b>5. Dice up some red pepper, and add that.</b> I used half of the red pepper shown above.</p><p><b>6. Dice up the cucumber, and toss that in the pan.</b> The cucumber should really be the center-piece of taste in the mix, and doesn't need a lot of cooking for the flavor to punch through.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9657.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9657.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9657.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9662.webp"  /></p><p>Though, in my example shown, I think I cooked everything together a little too long before getting to the next step.</p><div class='title'><b>7.

Next step, is adding a little bit of soy sauce.</b> As mentioned before, for this recipe I'm using that citrus soy sauce, and some organic soy sauce.   There are somewhat lighter, both in color and in salt, than actual soy sauce.  Because of the color it can be hard to gauge if you're adding too much.</p><p>Generally, I just run a spritz of each across the top.  Which might be about a combined quarter cups worth of sauce.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9671.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>12.

You want to have parts of it solid, and distinct.  I think I messed up a little bit with eggs.  The squash is pretty much a liquid when I added it.  I probably should have used only 2 eggs for the amount I was making, instead of 4.  I continued to cook this quite a bit longer than I usually do, but the amount was too great, and it started solidifying together with the more heat I added.</p><p>So, whatever, it's all done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9673.webp"  /></p><p>It might be a little chunky, but it's still good :)</p><p>Overall, I would add less eggs, and not cook the cucumber so much, but I could still taste all 3 of my main flavors that I put into this.  They are pretty harmonious.<br/>___</p><p>As I mentioned before, this is the basic recipe for any type of fried rice.  Just mix and match any of the ingredients in the earlier steps.  Typically the order is meat -&gt; vegetables -&gt; eggs -&gt; rice -&gt; sauce -&gt; seasoning.</p><p>I didn't use any seasoning (aside from some pepper mixed in here and there) with the above recipe because the flavors of the ingredients are meant to stand on their own.</p><p>If I'm making plain old fried rice with only onions and peppers, I'll add in some of this stuff.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9674.webp"  /></p><p>The sesame / seaweed mix goes a LONG way, so if you find some of this stuff, don't use too much in one sitting.  It's very very salty too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Packers v.

The sole reason behind this move was that my little sister and her husband purchased Packer tickets for themselves, my dad, and me for their game on Christmas Day.  They are pretty big sports fans, and love going to live events, sporting or otherwise.</p><p>In the past few years, they've brought me to a Badgers game, and a Twins game.  The Badgers game had a huge amount of fans, but no drinking at all.  The Twins game had plenty of drinking, but didn't really have the same level of fandom that Wisconsin brings to its game.  The Packers game had both.  There was massive amounts of drinking, and an incredible level of fandom.  I'm not really into football that much, and I'm even less into the Packers, but it's hard not to get into the game and root for the home team when you're completed immersed.</p><p>I took some pictures.</p><div class='title'><b>"Tailgating"</b></div><p>The game took place at 7:20pm on Sunday.

| October 31, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Now that I'm living in a larger space, I actually have room to do some random arts &amp; crafts.</p><p>I adopted an idea that my little brother has been doing for a while.  We're both pretty big fans of beer, and he collects a lot of beer related things, such as bottle caps and labels.  He takes these things and makes magnets out of them, which completely coats his fridge.</p><div class='title'><b>Collect Beer!</b></div><p>It's a neat idea, and with the Oktoberfest season looming, I decided to gather up as many local Oktoberfest brews as I could.  I started doing the second week in September.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8203.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8203.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8203.webp"  /></p><p>This is about half of all the bottles I collected over the course of the two months.  The Choose-your-own Six pack worked fantastically for collecting as many varieties as possible in the short time frame.  Overall, I found 25 different Oktoberfests.</p><p>This was a slightly dangerous idea though, as it combined 2 of my addictions together: Drinking Beer and Collecting Things.</p><div class='title'><b>Remove Labels</b></div><p>To remove the labels, I used a Wine Label Remover Kit found on Amazon, though, it's a little more expensive than what it is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3">Link</a></p><p>Each wine label remover is basically a thin sheet of laminate.  You wrap the laminate around the bottle, completely covering the label.  Then you peel the laminate off the bottle, taking the label with it.  And cut off all the extra laminate around the label.</p><p>The labels can be subborn sometimes, so I used a box cutter to help it along in most cases.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp"  /></p><p>While it's just as easy (sometimes) to remove the label without the lamanent, i think the labels look much better with the lamanent.</p><div class='title'><b>Attach to Magnets</b></div><p>The last part is affixing them to magnets.  Easy enough.  My little brother recommended using magnets sheets, and Super 77 adhesive spray.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp"  /></p><p>And it worked quite well.  I sprayed the whole sheet with a layer of glue, and arranged as many labels as I could.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8472.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8472.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8472.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8496.webp"  /></p><p>Then cut the labels out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8474.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8474.webp"  /></p><p>and Hurrah.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8561.webp"  /></p><p>These aren't arranged in any particular order.

We came across the <b>Highbridge Hills Sports Complex</b> (<a href="http://www.highbridgehillssc.com/pages/CourseMaps/" title="http://www.highbridgehillssc.com/pages/CourseMaps/">link</a>), which offered 7 courses in a single area.

The "club house" was just a shack at the top of the hill, with two older guys just hanging out talking about disc golf stuff over and over again.  Blueberry Hill was rather unkempt.  Much of the course was overgrown, and started choking out the fair way.  Much of the ground was uneven, and easy to trip on.  And it was usually a game to figure out where the baskets of each holes were.</p><p>For us, many of the holes were incredibly long.  This course would probably test real professionals of the sport, but we're quite amateur.  We play incredibly casually and don't have keep track of the score.  Dave is the only one of us who can actually catch some distance on his drives, and he was still getting 4s and 5s on these (long) par 3s.</p><p>Also, the course was soaking wet from the rain or dew from the previous night, so feet were drenched by the time we finished.  We decided to head up to Ashland, and venture around rather than play anymore.  Then we drank for the rest of the night, and pretty much went home in the morning.</p><p>Camping was totally the highlight of the trip for me. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okonomiyaki Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okonomiyaki-recipe">Okonomiyaki Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And while my number one favorite Japanese food is Ramen, my secret favorite is Okonomiyaki (tied with Onigiri).  Okonomiyaki is absolutely delicious, and you'd think that there would be a restaurant somewhere, anywhere in the US that would actually serve this stuff, but you can't find it at all.</p><p>It's not really that hard to make either.  Most Okonomiyaki restaurants in Osaka and Tokyo basically let you make these things yourself.  They'll mix everything in the back, bring it out to you, and give you the opportunity to fire 'em up.   The steps are quite easy.  Dump everything on the grill into a pancake, steam/fry it for 5 minutes, flip it, steam/fry it for another 5 minutes, and you're done.</p><p>Not all Okonomiyaki is made the same, though.  I've been to a few other restaurants that have their own set of instructions.  In Nagasaki, just down the road from Chitosepia, there's an Okonomiyaki vendor that builds the pancake first, then piles on all the cabbage, then all the other ingredients.  In Kumamoto, Dave and I visited a restaurant that had Choboiyaki, the regional version of Okonomiyaki.  They followed similar instructions to the Nagasaki version, except it was twice as large, and folded over in a burrito fashion.  The burrito was sliced up, and you ate those pieces.  Here's the blog post: <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=884</a></p><p>I didn't want to do anything that complicated with my own rendition.  I don't even have a flat surface to fry these on anyway.  I'm using a wok.  For my recipe, I started using the instructions from here: <a href="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html" title="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html">http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html</a></p><div class='title'><b>Ingredients</b></div><p>All you need is the following: Okonomiyaki Mix, Water, Eggs, Cabbage, Green Onion, Bacon, Okonomiyaki Sauce, Japanese (or Kewpie) Mayonnaise.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Equipment</b></div><p class='img'>You'll need a measuring cup to measure the flour and water, and you'll need a mixing bowl to mix everything in, along with a whisk to do the mixing.  You'll need a knife and a cutting board to chop up the cabbage and green onion.  You'll need a pan with a cover to fry and steam/fry everything in.  And you'll need a spatula to flip the pancake.  You'll also need a plate to eat it off of.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7343.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Step 1.

Add a bunch of cabbage.  The original recipe says 6 cups of Cabbage, but it's pretty easy to tell if you need more or less.  Just keep mixing everything together until all the Cabbage is covered.  If you have an amount of mixture left that hasn't covered cabbage.  Add more Cabbage.  Chop up (or mince?) 2 stalks of Green Onion.  Mix everything completely.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7240.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7240.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7240.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7241.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7241.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7242.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7242.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Step 2.

Try and flattened it out a little bit, but make sure to keep it as a circle.  When satisfied, take 3 strips of Bacon.  Cut them in half.  And cover the surface area of the pancake.  Then cover the pan, and let the pancake steam/fry for 5ish minutes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Step 3.

I had Fishy and Chaos over to give it a try, and they liked it quite a bit. :)  Though, what really brings out the nostalgia and flavor of the Okonomiyaki is the sauce and the mayonnaise.

Very safe, and normal.</p><p>Today is Saturday, and to fix the problem of the boring Okonomiyaki, I went to the farmer's market to find some delicious vegetables and food in hopes to shake things up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7330.webp"  /></p><p>I picked up some Shiitake Mushrooms, a Red Pepper, a Purple Pepper, some Okra, some Garlic, some Onions, and Edemame.  I also bought a bottle of dark honey.  It's amazing what you can get for a mere $10 these days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7332.webp"  /></p><p>For my next attempt, I mixed in 2 mushrooms, half a red pepper, and half an onion, along with the cabbage and green onion.

I think dividing the mixture into thirds would have worked out much better than halves, but it was much better than my first attempt.  The mushrooms, pepper, and onion contributed so much to the overall texture of the pancake.  It was quite good.</p><div class='title'><b>Salmon!</b></div><p>A couple of weeks ago, I bought some Smoked Salmon from the Public Market in Seattle, and figured it would be the perfect ingredient for Okonomiyaki.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp"  /></p><p>I read a little tip online on how to introduce Salmon into the mix, and it worked out pretty well.

Use 2/3 in the mix.</b> Take 2/3 of the salmon you've cooked and mix it in with everything else.  Leave 1/3 of the salmon in the pan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp"  /></p><p><b>3. Pancake!</b> Put your pancake mix over the 1/3 salmon remaining in the pan so you have a layer of salmon on the bottom, and a layer of bacon on the top.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp"  /></p><p>Oh my god, this turned out the best of the 3.  The salmon flakes on the bottom gave a delicious earthy texture, and the salmon internally gave a much more robust flavor to the entire meal.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7354.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7354.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7354.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7355.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Results!</b></div><p>Okonomiyaki is pretty easy to make once you purchase the flour, the sauce and the mayonnaise.

| August 31, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The night before I moved into my new apartment, Fishy, Chaos and I took a stroll down State St, and had dinner at The Osaka House to celebrate my night of homelessness.  There was a point where I had been to every sushi restaurant in Madison, but in the last 4 years several new places have emerged. The Osaka House poised itself on being new, but after our visit it is merely a satellite restaurant of Edo Restaurant.  Edo is located in Monona, and is where my coworkers and I go for sushi because it's the closest.  Osaka House had the same new menus that Edo has.  They even said 'Edo Restaurant' on the cover.  But anyway, this is all good because Edo Restaurant is quite delicious.</p><p>I ordered a bunch of rolls that sounded delicious, and I noticed a super cheap roll under the vegetarian options:  Asparagus Sushi, $3.  Hell, how could I pass that up.  Out of the whole night, I would say this roll was the stand out for me.  Though, not because it  was better tasting than anything else I had, but because I had no expectations for it.  I mean, $3 and purely vegetarian?  How good could it be?</p><p>But it was surprisingly good, and incredibly simple.  Just a single Asparagus stalk in rice.  Fuck, I could do that.  I've tried making sushi before, with disappointing results, but how could I mess this one up?</p><p>Now that I'm settled into my new place, I took a look at a few recipes online, and found the following recipe for preparing Asparagus (&lt;a href="http://embitca.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Cook-Asparagus"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and sticky rice (&lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/how-to-make-perfect-sushi-rice/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Make the two separate, and then combine.</p><p>Tonight, I invited two of my friends over, Kate and Fishy, and attempted to make them dinner.  So, here's what I did, and here's what I learned:</p><div class='title'><b>Asparagus Sushi Recipe</b></div><p>Here are all the ingredients you'll need</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp"  /></p><p>Black Pepper, Salt (I used Garlic Salt), Rice Vinegar, Balsamic Vinegar, Sugar (I used Honey), Olive Oil, Asparagus, Dried Seaweed (aka Nori), and Rice.</p><div class='title'><b>1) Make Rice</b></div><p>The first thing I did was make 2 cups of rice, because, out of all the steps, that takes the longest.  I have a rice cooker specifically for this task, but you can make the rice however you want.  Just make sure to <b>wash and clean</b> your rice, or else all the dust and dirt will get baked in and you lose a lot of flavor.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>2) Prepare Asparagus</b></div><p>I laid out all my Asparagus on a flat baking pan.  I covered the pan with some Aluminum Foil to save me from some extra clean up down the road.  On top of the Asparagus, I drizzled some <b>Olive Oil</b>, doing my best to coat the veggies.  Next, I did the same with a little bit of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  Followed by some <b>Black Pepper</b>.  And concluding with some <b>Balsamic Vinegar</b>.  With all the seasoning scattered on top, I started tossing all the Asparagus together to mix all the ingredients and to properly coat everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>3) Roast Asparagus</b></div><p>Rather than steam or pan fry the Asparagus, I went with the Roasting route as that recipe suggests.  I preheated the over to 400, and dumped the whole pan inside.  After a while they start to simmer and smell really really good.  After 10 minutes, I took a single piece and tried it.  Not quite finished.  We decided to leave them in there another 5 or 7 minutes. We probably should have left it in there a little longer than that, but it turned out alright.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>4) Sticky Rice Mixture</b></div><p>While the Asparagus were baking, I made the mixture for the sticky rice.  In the little pot, I combined the 1/4 cup of <b>Rice Vinegar</b>, 1/4 cup of <b>Honey</b>, and 2 tbsp of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  I didn't measure any of this, I just eye-balled it.  I turned on the stove to #4, which heated the mixture really fast.  The recipe says to mix everything until the powder has dissolved in the liquids, and then you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>5) Sticky Rice</b></div><p>With the mixture complete, simply add it to the rice, and mix mix mix.  While the White Rice is naturally very sticky, this mixture will start breaking it up a bit, and make the rice much more manageable, and delicious.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>6) Combine!</b></div><p>Putting Sushi together is the easy, and the most fun part of this whole recipe.  The more challenging parts (to me) are correctly preparing everything to put inside the sushi.  To make sushi, start with the <b>Nori</b>, lay down the <b>rice</b>, put the <b>ingredients</b> on the rice, roll them together, and that's it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp"  /></p><p>Though, you might find that quite difficult just using your hands to place everything together.  The rice will stick to anything dry, so the trick is to constantly wet your hands.  You can have a bowl of water to dip your hands in, or I just use water from the tap.</p><p>Wet your hands, grab some rice, stick in on the Nori, and continue until you have a line of rice.  Place the ingredients in the center most portion of the rice.  With your hands, roll the Nori and completely surround the rice.  Roll it all the way around so you have a tube.  Surround the tub with the bamboo roller, and tighten it up.  Hold it for a couple seconds so the heat can penetrate through all the layers of the Nori, and fuse it together.  Then release, and you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp"  /></p><p>With a super-sharp knife, you can segment the roll into individual pieces.  But my knife is somewhat dull right now, so we just chowed down on the rolls as is.</p><div class='title'><b>Lessons Learned, and solutions!</b></div><p>After eating that first roll, there were 2 problems...</p><p>The <b>first</b> problem was that you could hardly taste the asparagus.  If you notice that first image under combining, I only used 3 stalks in a roll.  The rice totally overpowered the sushi.  To solve this I used twice the amount of asparagus, and it turned out so much better.</p><p>The <b>second</b> problem was that I didn't clip the asparagus.  One step that I skipped from the Roasted Asparagus recipe was cutting off the fibrous wooden stem that cannot and should not be eaten.  The video made mention of the point between food and stem was the snapping point.  Hold on a stalk and break it with both hands.  Where it breaks is where you want it separated.</p><p>After solving these two problems, I thought they turned out delicious.  Though, I don't think my lady friends were impressed.  This isn't exactly gourmet food.  Plus, I don't have any furniture in my apartment, so we ate on my carpeted floor.  This was the <b>third</b> problem, I think.  Also, if I had dishes, then we could've made use of <b>soy sauce</b>.  Also, I was missing some <b>wasabi</b> and <b>ginger</b>.</p><p>But whatever.  This is some delicious food that was easy and quick to make.  Barring the 30-40 minutes it takes to make 2 cups of rice, everything else was about 20 minutes.  And most of the steps can be done concurrently, so once the rice is done, you can start rolling.  Though, you may want to wait 10 minutes for the rice to cool, or else you'll burn your fingers.</p><p>Also, going by this recipe, I yielded 7 rolls.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Running in 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/running-in-2011">Running in 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 9, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I ran my first Half Marathon of the 2011 Season.  And by Season, I mean an somewhat arbitrary range of dates to split up my winter races and non-winter races.  Training is much more difficult in the winter, so I don't want my winter times bringing down my non-winter times.</p><div class='title'><b>Seasons</b></div><p>What I am defining as the 2011 Running Season is basically Last April to Late October.  This is just for the Midwest and like-climates though.  Warmer climates would make it much easier to train and run all year round, so the "season" would probably just be the entire year.</p><p>For me, the season began last weekend with Madison's annual Crazy Legs Classic.  It's a 8 kilometer run from Capitol Square, through UW-Madison campus, and ending on Randal Field.  It's a really good start for the year, and the entire town really gets into it.  Almost 10,000 runners competed this year.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting back into Running</b></div><p>I did much better than last year, but I felt incredibly sluggish.  Winter makes it nearly impossible for me to train.  I can't train outside because it's too cold, and I can't train inside because it's too boring.  Before hitting the pavement back in March, I hadn't done any running at all since the Seattle Half Marathon and the Sandbox Indoor Half Marathon.  </p><p>Getting back into the work out is hard.  It was still cold out, so I wasn't getting any positive vibes from the sun.  And I felt horrible after each run.  I didn't feel like I was getting any benefit from it at all.  But there's one thing I've learned from running over the past 2 years.  <b>Motivation builds off of itself.</b>  </p><p>I know that running is beneficial for me, so I had to force myself to get out there and do it.  For April, I was outside every other day, and still felt like I wasn't getting any from it, but I kept doing it.</p><p>My Crazy Legs time wasn't the greatest (50 minutes), but I did better than last year.  Later in the week on Wednesday, the sun was out and shining, and I had an amazing run that day.  I was actually starting to feel some of the benefits of running, even though I still felt like crap.</p><div class='title'><b>Door County Half Marathon</b></div><p>This past weekend, I ran in the Door County Half Marathon, and going into it, I wasn't feeling very optimistic.  I still felt sluggish, and figured I would get a 2:30, or something.  But that wasn't the case.  I pushed forward, and actually started feeling really good.  In the middle of the race, my legs started matching pace with what I was capable of last year.  I was flying down hills, and able to build off of specific songs I was listening to.  I glided across the finish line and achieved a 2:20:02.</p><p>2:20 isn't my best time, but it is much faster than where I was at last year at this time.  My 2010 time for Door County was 2:34, and it was the first race where I really pushed myself.  I figured I would be around the same time this year, but I feel great that I was able to retain much of the speed I was working towards last year.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Getting a decent time (for me) has given me new motivation to continue to run, and do much better than last year.  I have 3 goals this year, but they all lead to the same thing.  1) I want to surpass my high score of 2:13.  2) I want to surpass 2:03, which is the world record for the FULL marathon.  and 3) I want to surpass 2 hours.  So, even though, they are 3 separate goals, they are really the same goal.  I guess "milestones" would be a better way to describe it.</p><p>Currently, I'm signed up for 2 more half marathons this year, but I'm sure I'll sign up for more as time goes on.</p><p>May 29th // Madison Half Marathon<br/>Aug 20th // Madison Mini-Marathon</p><p>Additionally, I signed up for my first FULL marathon, which is Milwaukee's Lakefront Marathon.  I was actually planning on signing up last year, but it was completely full by the time I decided to do so.  That takes place on October 2nd, so there is plenty of time to train and build up to it.</p><p>Run run run!</p><p>Also, if you're wondering, I keep track of all my racing times through Google Docs.  Here's a public link for that information:<br/><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html" title="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html">https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to C2E2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/c2e2">C2E2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 20, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, a bunch of us nerds went down to Chicago for their newest comic book convention, C2E2.  C2E2 is short for Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo, and does have more than just comic books.  It extends itself to the Entertainment industry, so it also has some guest appearances, and Q&amp;A panels for specific television shows.</p><p>I was rather excited to go since I missed PAX East this year, and I had never been to a Comic Con before.  I figured it would be in the vain of the San Diego Comic Con, or the New York Comic Con, where it has some comic book stuff, but has grown into TV shows, movies, and video games.  And while it did have some of that stuff, it was definitely muted and mediocre compared to the comic content.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp"  /></p><p>We arrived at the McCormic Park Place around 9:30am, which gave us a good 30 minutes before the Convention opened.  In very much PAX fashion, when arriving early, they had us go into a queue room when all the other early participants and patiently wait in line for the exhibition hall.  Con staff riled up the crowd with some chants in attempts to get video.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any crowd games for us to play :(</p><p>10am arrived, and we entered the exhibition hall.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The exhibition hall was jammed packed with comic distributors, indie comic and toy stores from the Chicago area, Tshirt vendors and other random stuff.  For a comic book convention, I expected vendors to have a large supply on hand, and maybe I would be able to fill in the gaps of my own comic collection, ala Battle Chasers #8, and The Maxx Trades #4 &amp; #5.</p><p>No such luck...  It seems that all the comic vendors at this convention specialize in ACTUAL rare comics, and my gaps were merely uncommon.  Comic book vendors had piles of vintage comics that had been appraised and worth plenty of cash.  And I wasn't interested in that.  I suppose I should have been checking prices because now I'm getting curious.  I wonder what the most expensive comic at the Con was...</p><p>There was one booth in the exhibition hall that I did want to check out, which was the Cyanide &amp; Happiness booth, and Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal attached themselves to.  I picked up one of C&amp;H's books and got it signed.  I also picked up SMBC's DVD of shorts, got that signed, and then got an on-the-fly sketch by SMBC artist, Zach Weiner.  I asked for some science related, and he didn't disappoint.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp"  /></p><p>The artist alley was nearly bone dry.  I have no interest in comic book looking art, which was the style of the vast majority of artists.  There were a few that caught my eye though.  I liked the style of <a href="http://erikrose.com/portfolio.htm" title="http://erikrose.com/portfolio.htm">Erik Rose</a>, whose art is based on a lot of films.  I didn't find any prints I especially like, but I bought a few buttons.  Another rockin artist was <a href="http://-amaya-.deviantart.com" title="http://-amaya-.deviantart.com">Tanya Zolotareva</a>, who had a very distinct gothy style and much different than all the other artists there.  Also, <a href="http://www.davidmack.net/" title="http://www.davidmack.net/">David Mack</a> was there, who has done some great work with the Kabuki series of comics.</p><p>Also, in the exhibition hall were the autograph booths.  Stars of TV, film, and music sat at booths for hours during the day and people lined up to get something autographed, or get their photo taken with them.  They had Sam and Pan from True Blood, who are two of my favorite characters on that show.  And they had Shane and Andrea from The Walking Dead, who are two of my LEAST favorite characters on that show.  They also had Helo from Battlestar Galatica, also my favorite character.</p><p>While that is pretty awesome, I find it odd that they got the B roll of characters for this convention.  That's like saying "We have the cast of The Simpsons", but then only Moe and Barney show up.  I guess you take what you can get.  Unfortunately, approaching these stars ISN'T free.  You can't just walk up to a celebrity without your wallet.  Duh...  Autographs were $30, and photos for $35.  Fuck that...  Off the top of my head, I can't even think of a celebrity I would pay to get a photo taken.  Maybe Keanu Reeves, but Keanu wouldn't allow that.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway, the exhibition hall was boring, so the next best time killer is going to Panels.  As one would expect, most of these panels were comic book related, and most of those were Marvel.  I don't think I could care less about Marvel, or DC, or any popular comic books.  Superhero comic books are so boring.</p><p>Even before arriving, the only panels that I was interested in were Evangelion related.  Spike Spencer (american voice of Shinji) was at the convention, and on Saturday, he was introducing Evangelion 1.0 before they screened it.  He also had a panel later on about voice acting.  While I don't really care about Spike Spencer, it was Evangelion related, and there was nothing else for me to do.  I didn't make Evangelion 1.0, but I did sit in on the last 10 minutes of his voice acting panel, which was Q&amp;A when I arrived.  Most of the questions were inside jokes that I did not get.</p><p>But success! I got my Evangelion Bluray signed by him, as well as purchasing his self published (and self printed) book about voice acting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess I had fun.  I was expecting a lot more video game related things, and more overall nerd culture, but it was all comic book instead.  And I would say that's a good thing, as the San Diego Comic Con, and New York Comic Con have slowly been overrun by thing that aren't comic books.  C2E2 is bringing back the Comic book convention to the comic book nerds, rather than succumb to the wiles of more popular entertainment.  But it still has some of that entertainment which makes the larger conventions so successful.</p><p>I would probably go again.  Especially if we had another large group of con-goers to hang out with, as we did this time.  I even ran into an old SPAMM member that wasn't part of our group!  It was good times :)</p><p>There were also quite a bit of costumers.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Protest!

The senate rammed the end of collective bargaining through on Wednesday.  The assembly passed it on Thursday.  And Walker signed for it on Friday.  Despite the constant protests, the republicans of Wisconsin did not care at all.  "Busting" the unions was their ultimate goal and financial situations played no part in it.</p><p>The people of Wisconsin, and citizens of the Midwest responded by showing up to the Capitol on Saturday to show their disapproval.</p><p>The Saturday rally comprised of 2 events.  Before Noon, the Wisconsin Farmer's Association drove their tractors to the Capitol and circled the square for about an hour in solidarity.  At 2pm, the main rally took place on the State St. side of the Capitol with several musical acts and speakers.</p><p>Jess, Jon and I got up to the Square to check out the tractors, which was more parade-like that protesting.  I don't really have any pictures of that because it was about as interesting as a parade.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp"  /></p><p>After roaming around for a while, we went to lunch.
