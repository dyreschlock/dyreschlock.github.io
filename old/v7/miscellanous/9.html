| November 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I had a particular spiffy weekend planned that ended up with way too many foibles and screw-ups.</p><p>My Friday plans ultimately took me to Chicago to see french synth rock band M83. I left work a little early to board a bus to Milwaukee, meet up with Dave, have some dinner, and drive down to Chicago. We went to a marvelous Mexican restaurant on the south-side of Milwaukee, went to a couple stores I had wanted to go to, and then headed south down 94.</p><p>M83 were playing at The Bottom Lounge. A venue that I assumed would be like any other venue I've been to where an electronic genre band would play. Some 'trendy' place with a constant flow of eletronica music building up to M83's performance. This was not the case. The Bottom Lounge was more of an indie rock venue where bands are setup on stage without an interim DJ to streamline to setup and tear down process.</p><p>So when we arrived around 10:30pm, which would've been the perfect build time to the night's headliners and a decent amount of attendance, I was quite perturbed to realize that the 9pm time on the ticket didn't mean "Doors at 9pm", it meant 9pm. Balls.</p><p>That was a secondary concern, though, considering that M83's performance sold out. Dave insisted that I, at least, spend my ticket I paid for. I did. And 15 minutes later, M83 finished up and tore down their equipment and readied the stage for the next band. Rather than pay for expensive beer in the "waiting room," we decided to drive around Chicago a little bit and then head home.</p><p>On the plus-side, M83 are fantastic. Their songs build layer after layer. Their voices, guitars and sound play in absolute harmony building this strong, powerful, warm aura. Apparently, M83 were huge earlier in the decade and hadn't produced anything new until this year. This tour was a slight comeback for their career. I may have heard some of their music before, but I didn't really know their name until their track appeared on Sasha's Involver 2. It's one of my favorite tracks on there, so I figured this would be a worthwhile event. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, I completely screwed up that night. Oh well...<br/>____</p><p>On Saturday, I had a date with a girl I went out with a few times in the past few weeks. Everything seemed to be going great with her. We really enjoyed each others company. But she dumped me because she's busy all the time and doesn't really have time to date.</p><p>On the plus-side, I now know of a Driving Range that's pretty close to my apartment and is open all winter long!<br/>____</p><p>For Sunday, Tony and I had tickets for the Madison Opera's production of Madama Butterfly. Madama Butterfly is set around Glover Garden in Nagasaki. Pinkerton, a US Navyman, meets Butterfly, a geisha, while stationed in Nagasaki. They fall in love, and are wed. Pinkerton must return to the US, though, and he leaves Butterfly in Japan. That's the first act. The second act focuses on Butterfly and her resolve and dedication for Pinkerton. And in the third act, Pinkerton returns, but not with joyful news.</p><p>MY GOD can opera be boring. I think one of their larger mistakes was omitting the second intermission with 5 minutes of low-light visual aura and pleasant somber music describing the evening turning into night turning into midnight turning into morning. I nearly fell asleep at several points.</p><p>I screwed up this event by forgetting the tickets at home by the time we arrived at the parking garage. We finally got into the overture center 20 minutes after Madama had already begun. We were able to watch the first act on monitors they had in the waiting room, but the quality was so horrible, you couldn't even read the translation.</p><p>It was certainly interesting to see a production of Madama Butterfly, but the aesthetic of Madama Butterfly is more opera oriented rather than Japanese oriented, so it fell a little flat for me.<br/>____</p><p>Between these failures, I bought a couple new records on Saturday morning and watched a bunch of sad movies on Sunday and now I'm under the weather today for some reason. Oh well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oiLfTnrC40" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oiLfTnrC40">Marmoset, there'll be days like this.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 35W Construction Complete" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/35w-construction-complete">35W Construction Complete</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera in the Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/opera-in-the-park">Opera in the Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Opera in the Park, Brat Fest, Rhythm and Booms..  Art fair on the Square was pretty well attended too.  What other traditional Madison festivals and fairs are there?  At the end of the night, they announced that over 13,000 people were there which is pretty incredible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" /></p><p>The event started around 8pm and went on into the night.  The first two songs that began with I had heard in one form or another before hand, but had never heard the actual song.  Largo al factotum (the figaro song) and Anvil Chorus I remember from Looney Tunes. ^_^  The figaro song is also usually heard in commercials too.  Usually spaghetti sauce commercials.  I think it's kinda funny that the height of my opera experience was from other forms of media using it either poorly or commercially, but at least I had some exposure to it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was the perfect day for laying in the park listening to some fantastic music. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Madama Butterfly</b></div><p>Despite not knowing anything about Opera, there is one opera that I know of thanks to Asian American Literature at Platteville and that is Madama Butterfly.  I think we read the original short story, Madame Butterfly, the opera was based on.  It was rather brief, but gave us the background needed to start reading M. Butterfly, which is a play inspired by the book.</p><p>Madame Butterfly is about a Japanese Geisha woman in Nagasaki known to her friends as Butterfly.  She meets an US sailor, Pinkerton, who's ship is in town.  They fall in love and get married, but Pinkerton must return to the states.  The main emotion of the story is Butterfly's longing and loyality to Pinkerton as she continues to work as a Geisha   She continues to wait and wait and wait for his return, despite her friends constantly telling her that he's never going to return.  That he doesn't love her and it was just a little fling for him.  She continues to believe in Pinkerton.  AND.. Many twists and turns happen when Pinkerton finally returns to Nagasaki.</p><p>M. Butterfly is an interesting parallel tale of love between the actors who portrey the characters in a similar opera featuring cross-dressing and John Lithgow.</p><p>Anywho, Madama Butterfly is being performed by the Madison Opera in November!  I'm totally going.  I think I'll try to read the books again beforehand.  They also have a preview/lecture about the play a week before that'll probably be interesting, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lake Delton" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lake-delton">Lake Delton</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was just like walking on a beach.  There was a bit of a stream running through the sand.  I took off my sandals, rolled up my pant legs and walked around in the water a little bit to get some close up pictures.  The water was cool compared to the warmed up sands.</p><p>However, I was incredibly careful...  The entire time I was thinking about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc">this youtube video</a> and another video of a guy sinking in mud or quicksand really fast and completely vanished.  I thought of these when I was slowing sinking in the sand while walking in the water, but it hadn't happened the entire time out there.  Until, I stopped thinking about it...  and sunk down past my knees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't running or anything, so I was right near the edge of the solid sandy surface and the mud pit, so pulling myself out was pretty easy.  The whole time I kept slowing sinking down and kept saying to myself, "stop stop stop stop stop...  holy crap."  Luckily I had already taken my sandals off or I probably would've had to buy new ones.  Though my sandals probably kept my "afloat" longer having a larger area to step on rather than the thin area my feet cover.</p><p>I didn't stray too far from shore after that. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, Lake Delton is pretty screwed..  It probably looked like hell after it initially drained with all the dead fish corpses and more perilous mud pits.  There's a new article today that said crews are beginning to repair the dam this week, so it might be fixed by next year.  I wonder what it'll look like in winter.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Leinenkugel's" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/leinenkugels">Leinenkugel's</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Zach got a fancy internship at Cray Computers for the summer, but has found that working in the middle of nowhere leads to much loneliness.  I saw Dark Knight with him on the way up, and with a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon ahead of us, we went to the Leinenkugel's Brewery which is also in Chippewa Falls.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" /></p><p>It was quite quaint but also pretty fancy too.</p><div class='title'><b>Leinie Lodge</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" /></p><p>The main public facility in the Leinie Lodge which is a big gift shop and also the place to sign up for a tour of the brewery itself.  Inside they had tons of crappy merchandise.  They put the Leinie logo on nearly everything..  from postcards to notebooks to fishing tackle to shirts to chairs to rulers to hold punchers to anything really.</p><p>It was really annoying because it took me forever to find a keychain bottle opener to match my New Glarus one.  I should've picked up a pint glass to match my New Glarus ones too, but I didn't think of it.  It doesn't really matter though, since those glasses were kinda ugly.</p><p>We signed up for the tour and off we went an hour later.</p><div class='title'><b>Brewery</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" /></p><p>This here is the main bottling facility which is where 100% of the tour went.  We went up and down the elevator a couple times to the 4 floors that serviced the actually creation of the beer.  The mixing of the hops, wheat and all that crap I wasn't paying attention to..</p><p><b>Fact</b>: They still add their active and flavoring ingredients by hand during the process, which allows them to still fall in the category of a Craft Brewery.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Also, they employ less than 52 workers at any given time to also keep this status.</p><p>We went got outside and went into another portion of the building that serviced bottling and then shipping.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Every single bottle or can or keg produced by the brewery has been ordered in advance. They never make more than what is already spoken for.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: A good chunk of their workers are hired help for the summer from local colleges.  This is why they have a bunch of summer and fall beers, but not many winter and spring beers.</p><p>I learned a few things, but that was pretty much it.  It was a neat tour and the tour guide was cute.  Zach started talking with her quite a bit as the tour ended about this and that. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Comparing tastes...</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" /></p><p>The whole area of the brewery was really nice.  Plenty of trees throughout the facility, and a babbling brouk passing between the Leinie lodge and the Brewery.  It was more pleasant than the other two brewerys I've been to.</p><p>The New Glarus Brewery is alright..  but it's really small.  The tours are self guided, so you can show up at anytime and walk through the place.  They give you a little phone thingy you can punch numbers into when you see them on the wall, but it's all rather useless info.  The giftshop had useful things and actually sold the beer, though.</p><p>Times are changing though, as New Glarus has just expanded to open up their much larger facility on the other side of the town.  From the road, it looks probably just as big as the Leinie brewery.  They still plan on keeping their original brewery open for their craft beers, but will use the new facility for more mass production.</p><p>The other brewery I've been to is the Asahi Beer Factory in Fukuoka, Japan, which is absolutely different than these two.  The Asahi Brewery is massive.  Bigger than most Wal*marts I've been to.  The production is super fast and their volume is huge.  It definitely lacked the heart of our wisconsin brewerys, though..  Also, I couldn't understand what the hell the guide was talking about.</p><div class='title'><b>Local is better</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" /></p><p>Overall, I'd say this has been the best Brewery Tourery I've been on.  The Leinie's brewery has a lot more history than New Glarus but still keeps everything down to earth.  I still like New Glarus' Spotted Cow over anything that Leinie's has, but Leinie is a great goto beer.  You can find it nearly everywhere and it never lets you down. ^_^</p><p>Leinie's Octoberfest beer should start showing up at retailers in the next few weeks, so that'll replace Spotted Cow for me for a little while. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure what other brewerys I'd like to check out next..  maybe I'll go to Ireland and check out Guiness or something.  I'd like to go back to the Asahi Beer factory and get a keychain bottle opener to match my other ones.  I'm sure I'll find myself somewhere.</p><p>As another note, Zach and I came across a tanning salon with a must hilarious name:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/10">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/8">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
