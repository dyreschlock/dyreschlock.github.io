I started updating my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">games list</a> as well, and got to the point of taking pictures of my new arrivals.</p><p>I put batteries into my camera and tried to turn it on..  nothing.  "hmm..  batteries must be low.."  I got another set of charged batteries and the same thing occurred.  Nothing..  Silence.. Death..</p><p>Sadness..  It appears my old camera has finally bit the dust.</p><div class='title'><b>A look back..</b></div><p>I received my camera for Christmas of 2002.  Since that time I've taken about 15,000 pictures with it. Even discovered that the camera doesn't know how to count once it goes past 10,000.</p><p>I was quite the shutter bug up until about a year ago..  It started becoming an annoyance carrying around this big 'ol camera..  It wasn't very convenient.  I picked up my picture takin' styles when I got to Japan..  but once again, it began to fade.  Then one drunken night I must've smacked it against a hard surface, because the white balance was extremely sensitive..  It hadn't been the same since..  Pictures came out really bad and washed.</p><p>The last pictures I ended up taking with it was of Justin, Alex and Eric in North Carolina..</p><p>Poor Sony Cybershot..  Dec 2002 - June 2007</p><p>Even though, I didn't actively use it in recent days.. It feels weird not having it.  Like I have no way of photographically recording my life whereas I had the option before.</p><div class='title'><b>A look forward..</b></div><p>Anyways..  I had resigned myself to getting a new sleek tiny powerhouse of a camera, but kept putting it off.  I suppose now I have a good reason to actively look for a new one.  Something small that I can easily port around with me at all times, and something powerful so pictures don't look like ass.  Probably something that uses an SD card so I can easily look at pictures on my Phone and Wii without much hassle.  My laptop has an SD card slot too.</p><p>Since I'm so great at saving and conserving money and have given up credit cards, I'll have to wait a week until I get paid to actually purchase one.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wordpress + Google Reader: RSS 2.0 v.

| June 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A while ago, when Google Reader decided to lose all my RSS feeds, I went through and re-added as many as I could remember.  And then Google Reader automatically fixed the problem and combined all my original ones with the newly added ones.</p><p>One little interesting thing that occurred was that I signed up for an RSS feed and Atom feed of the same blog.  "ha ha, that's funny," i thought and proceeded to leave it on there.  Mainly because Google Reader made no indication what the difference between the two were.  The particular blog in question is <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org" title="http://blog.t-kun.org">Tony's blog</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>By the way...</b></div><p>An RSS feed is blanket term to describe a simple XML representation of a blog.  Every blogging software has these things built into it these days.  Wordpress, Livejournal, Blogger, etc.. These are separate links that contain all the same data.  <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom" title="http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom">http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom</a> is the link for the Atom feed of Tony's site.  There are two main types of RSS feeds: an RSS feed and Atom feed.  Both do the same thing and pretty much all feed readers take in both, but have slight syntactical differences and standards.  RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 are the current versions.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom wikipedia</a> article goes into details on the differences between the two.</p><p>An RSS feed reader is a program that takes in all these links and checks them periodically for new articles.  That way you don't have to check 20 sites 20 times a day.  Just check your RSS reader and huzzah .. all new articles you haven't read yet brought into one source.</p><p>If you happen to be reading this post on my site rather than an RSS Feed, and you happen to be using Firefox, take a look at the address bar up top.  See that little orange symbol?  If you click it, Firefox will automatically sign you up for this RSS Feed.  It's just that easy.</p><p>Definitely check out <a href="http://reader.google.com" title="http://reader.google.com">Google's RSS Reader</a> if you haven't, for all your feed reader needs.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways...</b></div><p>After a week has gone by, I've begun to notice a little difference in the way Wordpress does its rendering of these two feeds.</p><p>First off, let's take a look at the two feeds themselves, side by side.</p><p>RSS 2.0</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" /></p><p>Atom</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" /></p><p>(These are screenshots of wordpad because Wordpress cannot display xml or code in general nicely at all... ><;; )</p><p>You can start to see the little differences, but the meat of the article is retained.  What's really weird is how Google Reader renders this particular article</p><p>Google Reader + RSS</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" /></p><p>Google Reader + Atom</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" /></p><p>Weird..  Google Reader takes the Atom at face value, rather than rendering out that ascii code as in the RSS feed.</p><p>Also, for some reason, I seem to get the Atom version an hour later than the RSS version (despite the article time being the same).  also weird..</p><div class='title'><b>uh...</b></div><p>Anyways, I don't really have an explanation for this.  I'm not sure what version of Wordpress Tony is using, but I'd guess its not Wordpress 2.2, which was released a couple of weeks ago, WHICH, I would assume actually uses Atom 1.0 rather than Atom 0.3 that Tony's Atom feed suggests.  Actually, looking at the XML, Tony is using 2.0.4.</p><p>:shrugs: I thought it was an interesting little tidbit.  I wonder if Google Reader's feed fetching of Atom 1.0 is better than 0.3.  I also wonder if Wordpress 2.2 isn't as annoying as Wordpress 2.whatever version i have.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Car" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-car">New Car</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of these days, I'll actually get a new car.  Not necessarily another car, but a brand-spanking new car that will solely be my responsibility, and not the fault of the previous drivers.  But the obvious question arises..  What car do i buy?  What car defines me as a person?  Such a difficult question.  I've been toying with many different car choices, so I thought i'd put them side-by-side to compare.</p><div class='title'><b>Subaru WRX</b></div><p>I love this car a lot.  It was bread from the infamous Imprezza Rally car we've seen so much of.  It's cute, sporty, and fast.  However, it's a bit expensive and gets shitty gas mileage.  It's start off at around $25,000 and gets about 20 mpg city / 27 mpg highway.  That's about the same gas mileage my current gets and it just went over 100,000 miles!  I like style, but I'm not going be in the same boat for gasoline.</p><p>Sorry, WRX.  I might test drive you, but the closest to owning you I will ever get will be in Gran Turismo.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Sweet, Pretty, Fast, Japanese, Uncommon<br/><b>Con's</b>: Price, Gas Mileage, everything that matters.</p><div class='title'><b>Toyota Prius</b></div><p>Given the new fad of not paying up the ass in gasoline, I focused my sights on the Prius, known for the best mileage on the planet.  60 City, 55 Highway.  Though, reports have been saying those numbers are grossly inflated, the real problem with the Prius is its life expectancy.  Apparently, these cars only live to 100,000 miles, then they start having weird errors and just begin to die out on you.  100,000 miles is about 8 years, give or take..  I'd have to pay off the thing by then, or else I'll be paying for a dead car.  The thing costs $25,000 in the first place.  On average it gets about 2 to 2.5 times the mileage as a WRX, but my WRX is going to live about 2 to 2.5 times as long..  It'd be better off getting a WRX..  at least then I wouldn't be driving a chick car.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Gas Mileage, Good for Enviroment, Japanese<br/><b>Con's</b>: Price, Life Expectancy, Reputable as a Girl's Car, Very Common</p><div class='title'><b>Volkswagen Jetta</b></div><p>Whatever..  I started looking at a car that has proved itself time and time again.  The good 'ol Jetta costs about $17,000 and gets about 40 mpg on average.  Though dealerships seem to indicate it gets shitty gas mileage, Jetta owners will proudly let you know they get an average of 40+ miles.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Gas Mileage, Price, "German Engineering in the House" commercial, not Japanese but still Foreign<br/><b>Con's</b>: Common, Reputable as Girl's Car, Jetta Owners have same mentality as Mac Users.</p><p>So if I sacrifice all amounts of style for cost effectiveness, we've got the Jetta.  Eh, sounds pretty good to me..</p><p>I put Common as a Con, but that's really from a stylistic point of view.  Functional-wise, the more common a car the better because more people will have parts and knowledge to service it if/when it breaks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Reflection with Generics" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/reflection-with-generics">Reflection with Generics</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Something I've been working on at Widen has been the ability to add OGNL expressions into a Tapestry Component for Lists.  I set up this whole elaborate CRUD application to add in all this data, but when it got to the Users actually entering in an OGNL expression for a specified Class..  they were somewhat baffled.  When looking at a screen with a Class name and a blank text field, how are you supposed to know which OGNL expressions you can use?</p><p>I can't expect the User to have the entire application's API memorized in their head.  So, it was no surprise that the first suggestion on my CRUD page was a list of the Class's methods.  Of course, not all the methods..  just the ones that play nice with OGNL.</p><p>Getting at these methods is dirt simple when you have the Class object of what you're working with.<br/><pre>Class object = MyClass.class;<br/>Method[] publicMethods = object.getMethods();</pre><br/>huzzah..</p><p>getMethods() will only return the methods visible to anyone.  Since private and protected methods are not accessible to just anyone, you'll only get the public methods.  Of course, this will return every single public method from every super class..  so you'll get a bunch of methods from Object and other classes that have information you don't really care about.  Use this instead:<br/><pre>Method[] publicMethods = object.getDeclaredMethods();</pre><br/>getDeclaredMethods() will only return methods declared within the Class itself (and are only visible to anyone).  But, we probably want some methods from super classes that are interesting.  Thus begins the filtering out process.<br/>______</p><p>Anyways, now that I've got my Method, I want a couple things from it: a) the Name of the Method, b) the Return Type, and c) the Declaring class.  Mostly, I want to mimic the basic method list that pops up when developing in an IDE.  Well, it just so happens the Method has all this information built in for me.<br/><pre>String methodName = method.getName();<br/>Class returnType = method.getReturnType();<br/>Class declaringClass = method.getDeclaringClass();</pre><br/>It's all pretty self explanatory until I got a new request yesterday about all this.  Some of these methods return Lists, Sets, Collections and like and when it displays this information, OGNL simply uses toString() which doesn't look pretty at all.  It usually prints out something like this:<br/><pre>[MyClass info info, MyClass info info, MyClass info info]</pre><br/>The request was to add some way of stylizing the object within a Collection, which wasn't too tough.  I added another OGNL expression value to the CRUD page and intercepted the value going into the List Component..  but now I'm back at the beginning.  Another blank text field will no idea what to put in it, and this time I don't even have the Class.  Luckily, reflection is here to save the day.</p><p>Let's say this is my class:<br/><pre>public class MyClass<br/>{<br/>...<br/>private List otherClasses = new ArrayList();<br/>...<br/>public List getOtherClasses()<br/>{<br/>return otherClasses;<br/>}<br/>}</pre><br/>and I've got my Method object of getOtherClasses.  You might be tempted to do this:<br/><pre>method.getTypeParameters()</pre><br/>which returns an Array of TypeVariables.  These are the declaring Generic types, rather than the declared types, so you'd get the letter E, rather than OtherClass, since the declaration of List looks like:<br/><pre>public class List&lt;E&gt;</pre><br/>This baffled me for a while, but it makes sense after thinking about it.  This is the return type and its properties.  On its own, it is completely independent from your Method.  After much searching around and asking for help, Method has another helpful function:<br/><pre>Type returnType = method.getGenericReturnType()</pre><br/>I was always looking for the generic type on the return type's Class rather than the Method.  As far as I can tell, this will return two different Object which extend Type: either a Class equal to the Return Type, or a ParameterizedType.  The ParameterizedType holds the owner and the generic parameters.<br/><pre>if(method.getGenericReturnType() instanceof ParameterizedTypeImpl)<br/>{<br/>for(Type type : ((ParameterizedTypeImpl) method.getGenericReturnType()).getActualTypeArguments())<br/>{<br/>genericsOfReturnType.add((Class) type);<br/>}<br/>}</pre><br/>Now my little dynamic API window on my CRUD page is complete.  I wonder if this is how javadoc compiles all of its html pages.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Moving Days" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/moving-days">Moving Days</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It gives me a chance to flex those dormant Tetris skills and maximize the amount of volume my stuff will take up in my car while minimizing the amount of containers holding my things, thus minimizing the amount of trips i need to make going back and forth between residence and automobile.  Once again, i was able to fit all of my stuff into my car, minus a book shelf, desk and chair, despite the least amount of volume I've ever had to work with, though it was quite a tight fit.</p><p>Wednesday, when I returned from my North Carolina trip, I was greeted by my roommates fast at work emptying out our house into their trucks and cars.  Except for my clothes, all of my things were already boxed up and stuffed into my room before flying away.  I joined them and moved my things into my car.  It took me about an hour to stuff my car full, but i still had all my clothes laying around and some other random stuff.</p><p>The night continued with throwing most of the uncontested items of our household into garbage bags and hurling them onto the curb.  Once we got rid of all that junk, the house really began to come together and look amazingly clean.  I rode with my now ex-roommates over to their new place and moved some of their things up into their place.  They scored a quaint tiny place about 2 blocks away from the capitol.  The perfect living quarters after bar hopping across State St.</p><p>We made one more trip back to the old home and get rid of all the garbage bags outside.</p><p>The next day, yesterday, I woke up a bit late and rolled out of bed.  After showering, I grabbed the reminder of my possessions in the house, and bid adieu.  With the back-end of my car weighed  down heavily, I puttered to work.  Gage calls me up during my lunch and says that we could move into our new place today if I went down to the office and signed a contract.  huzzah.  Looks like I wasn't homeless for too long after all.  I phoned up Kyle to tell him that we're moving in today.</p><p>After work we began moving everything into our new place.  Our new place sits on the end of a cul-de-sac, nestled softly between several other homes.  From the street, the driveway is a 35 degrees incline (maybe more) leading up to the house, which is about 20 feet above the street below.  My room is on the Second and a Half floor of the house, but moving things from my car up there totaled about a 4 story climb. :/</p><p>After a vigorous workout of handling furniture and boxes up the hill, and walking back down, our stuff was once again sheltered under a tall roof and sheet rocked walls.</p><p>Moving is always pretty easy for me.  I have container for everything I own and never have more on me than what I can't drive away with.  I've gotten in this habit from moving around so much in the past 6 years of my life.  Moving back and forth between Minneapolis and Platteville for so long, and then Madison, Nagasaki, then Madison again this past year. Of course, I usually had a van or a station-wagon to move everything around with.<br/>It gets annoying when I help people move and they don't have a clear grasp of how they want their stuff to go from point A to point B.  The more boxes of varying size and the less trips back and forth the better!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Furniture Closure" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/furniture-closure">Furniture Closure</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

With only a few weeks before I move across town, laying down on the floor, tip-typing away no longer appeals to me all that much.  Something had to be done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  now i can say to myself, "no matter what happens, i've got that desk situation under control.  it's taken care of.  i'm done.  complete."</p><p>It's amazing how an elevated flat surface can add so much order, harmony and cleanliness to a room.  Luckily, if i still want to use a computer like a hobo, i've got my handy laptop fixed.</p><p>The whole black and white theme could be quite attractive, but several pieces on my desk need repairment to promote it.  Some new white computer speakers would be rad, and possible a new mouse too.  I've had those computer speakers for nearly 8 years.  I guess they'll just be another computer hand-me-down for my parents.</p><p>Thanks go out to Erika and Stephen for helping me bring this desk all the way from Chicago back to Madison.  I'm not too sure if my crappy car would have been sufficient transport.</p><p>While in Chicago yesterday, we made the mandatory stop at Mitsuwa.  I had never appreciated that place as much as i do now.  It's the midwest's little piece of Japan.  The stores are squished together like in Japan, the employees are polite like in Japan (though, they speak english to us westerners :/), and everything is in Japanese (w/ plenty of subtitles).  It's really the most Japanese i've been immersed in since returning to that states.  I love walking up to a restaurant and being able to read the menu.  ã?«ã??ä¸¼, ã¶ã£ã?ã?ã?ã©ã??, é³¥ã?«ã?¬ã?ã©ã??.  ^_^</p><p>I purchased several items in bulk, and called it a day.  There were plenty of kids from Anime Central hanging out as well.  Unfortunately, ACen neglected to have a saturday only pass available for purchase, or else i may have thought of considering going for a few hours.</p><p>Shade.</p><p>Wheeewww.

When i don't have anything particular to work on, I'll log into our bug tracking software. This has a list of all bugs and cases that people are and aren't working on. I sort for unassigned cases, and then assign it to myself. This is pretty much like any bulletin board you'll find around anywhere, especially in an old medieval town, usually on the back wall of a tavern. "Search for a Dragon", "Provide safe passage across the Bog of Sorrow", "Fix order processing", "This image doesn't show up in IE".. ya know. Daily Quests.</p><p>Once i pick up my quest, it's time to journey into the wilderness. The dark forest which contains complex webs of Java code. I delve deeper into the darkness, running over what happened to the contractor when he was doing the same thing. Finding the problem, developing a strategy/solution, and going through with it. I'm sure i could come up with a clever analogy if i thought about it.</p><p>Success. The quest has been complete, back to town to report my success. As, i return to town, I sync up my code base to be completely current with events and things that have happened while i was away. I didn't get any emails about Build Errors, so it appears the town was safe while i was away. I reach the gates of the inner city, and run my JUnit test suite, just to make sure the results of my quest don't infect and harm my fair town.</p><p>Crap. It appears by slaying this particular dragon, I have violated this one test that says there are only 7 of these left in the world. Now that there are 6, it fails. Well... i'll just rewrite that test to indicate 6.</p><p>Success again. The tests are green, and i'm good to go. I reach the tavern inside the city and lay down my solution on the bar counter, committing these changes to the repository. The commit message indicates which Quest this dead dragon is for.</p><p>And I'm set to go. Another job well done, and time to look for a new quest. Occasionally I'll get handed down an official assignment from city officials, like a feature request or refactor.</p><p>Abstraction is key to developing any application.. though, sometimes it helps to keep things a little more grounded.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Use the Google" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/use-the-google">Use the Google</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Whenever I open up a browser, I'm in my own little Googlized world.  My personalized homepage is complete with the current weather outside, quick submit links for ebay and wikipedia, quick links various websites, news feed from digg.com, and the Gmail gadget and Google Reader gadget.  When Firefox opens up, i've automatically checked my mail and all my RSS feeds.  It's pretty handy when you don't want extra programs running in the background.</p><p>Thanks to Google Reader, I now know that kotaku.com is FAR faster at getting video games news to the Internets than Jostiq.com, most of the time.</p><p>My personalized homepage is also pimpin' with the Japanese fox theme, even though i'm pretty sick of it now.  Google is also pretty handy on my phone, when I'm not at work or home.  My personalized homepage is just as easy to access, so i can still get my mail and my news.  Google Maps is pretty slick on my phone, too.</p><p>Speaking of which, Google Maps made some pretty slick upgrades recently.  Besides new Satellite photos, you can save your own 'maps' and easily import and export from Google Earth.   I made a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1"> quick map of points</a> that those studying abroad might be interested in knowing ahead of time.  Just a couple basic areas.  I'll probably make another map that works with my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">Games List</a> a little better than my current solution.  These maps can be saved as a KML file, which loads directly into Google Earth.</p><p>If you haven't played around with Google Earth, it's free for download.  Just go to <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="http://earth.google.com/">earth.google.com</a>.  Google Earth is a 3 dimensional atlas of the world.  You start up far above the earth, and can zoom into anywhere you'd like.  The surface of the earth is skinned with the same Satellite images from Google Maps and works similarly.  When you get closer to the ground, the details of Earth become more clear..  The satellite images are high enough quality most of the time that you can see buildings, cars, and houses quite distinctly, just like Google Maps.</p><p>However, Google Earth can do far more than that.  Google Earth also renders terrain and buildings in 3D.  You can tilt the view to get a good grasp of what the area actually looks like.  Here's the Nagasaki area:</p><p>Google Earth streams all these images and information in real time, so it takes up very little space on you computer.  Though, it does load all its' cache into memory, which doesn't make it very light weight.</p><p>Google Earth also has links to Wikipedia, Google Earth communities, and  Panoramio: a community photograph repository.  People from around the world, can upload their photos and input coordinates on where their picture was taken.  Each month, Google grabs all the new information from Panoramio and hooks it into Google Earth.</p><p>Yesterday, i finally decided to make my own Panoramio account and start uploading photos.  I went through pictures #10000 through #17000 on my camera.  Basically, the time i was in Japan and the summer before hand.</p><p>Here's my account: http://www.panoramio.com/user/449013<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Enter the Pidgin" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/enter-the-pidgin">Enter the Pidgin</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A gigantic pile of stuff that i own, but don't really want to deal with.  I like owning things.</p><p>One thing that was incredibly liberating about living in Japan for a while was my absence of stuff.  I left America with a suitcase filed with clothes, a laptop, my DS and games, and a couple personal items.  In Japan, i was free of all my worldly attachments as they were back on planet America.  Liberated.  Though, it was very reassuring that i hadn't lost anything.  A world away, my huge pile of stuff still sat there.  Still mine.  There was, maybe, once or twice that i wished i had a movie of mine with me in Japan, but beyond that, it never brought me down that i didn't have my stuff.</p><p>Well, i suppose i did have my online 'Stuff' with me.  My blog, pictures, and tons of other crap.</p><p>Truthfully, i had really been doing this for years during college.  My parents house is home to my main pile of stuff, and i would leave it up in Minneapolis, as i lived down in Platteville.  Throughout that time, i would acquire some new things and every one in a while, I would add these new things to my gigantic pile of stuff in Minneapolis.  I was never in a position where i couldn't visit my stuff pile without great difficulty.</p><p>Throughout my time in Japan, i did acquire several new things.  I started growing a new pile of stuff, and forget about what i had at home.  When i got back home, all my stuff was in one place, yet again.  My game library was all together.  My books were there, comics, flyers, etc...</p><p>But how much does all this stuff weigh me down.  Why do i need issue 43 of Nintendo power?  Who do i need a Club flyer of Bad Boy Bill from 2003?  Why do i need all my CS notes from College?</p><p>These are really just piles of stuff, and the only reason i feel the need to own them is because of sentiment.  I got that issue of Nintendo Power in the mail in 1990, and used the maps inside to beat that Nintendo Game.  I got that flyer from The Quest or Vital Vinyl when i was there that Summer and probably took pictures.  I spent fruitless amounts of time copying those notes down because it was imperative for later use.  They are a part of my history, it's not necessarily that they are monetarily valuable.  It's like being the curator for my own personal library.</p><p>This stuff is primarily relics from the past, but i hold onto things for the future.  What if i or some friend wishes to play this game, or read this book, or watch this movie, or etc?  Then we can share in part of my past.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/14">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/12">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
