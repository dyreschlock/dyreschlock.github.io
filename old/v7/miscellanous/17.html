We went to Vital Vinyl and Let it Be records to look for new events and records. I bought Sasha's Xpander XP, and Luke Chable's remix of Cloud Cookoo. Beautiful remix to a beautiful song. We also went to an arcade. They didn't have F-Zero AX, but they did have DDR Extreme.</p><p>On our way home, it began to snow. Then the snow turned into a fricken blizzard! Man, this is so great. I was so happy that I shoveled the driveway when I got home. ^_^</p><p>--</p><p>In other news, for dinner, I had some more delicious ramen.</p><p>First up, another Korean delight: <b>Nong Shim's Oriental Style Noodle Seafood Ramyun</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_seafood.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_seafood.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_seafood.webp" /></p><p>Oh my god. It was so good. Learning from ramen yesterday, I let these noodles cook longer before adding the seasoning and egg, and it paid off excellenetly! After the water boiled in the pot, I added the noodles. I cooked and stirred them until they felt cooked. Then I added the egg. I stirred in the egg, and allowed the water to boil again. After properly mixed, I added in the seasoning and the veggies. I continued to stir and cook them for a little while longer, and then served them in my bowl.</p><p>Man, I think my taste buds have grown accustomed to the Nong Shim spice. It was spicy, but I was easy able to handle it. The soup base tasted excellent. It was a very pure blend of spice and sea that worked very well together. Boiling the noodles with the base brought the taste into the noodles, which got rid of the bland dried-up taste.</p><p>I give Nong Shim's Ramyum a generous <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. It was excellent. But perfect? I think that'd be too much.</p><p>---</p><p>Next, I took on <b>Sapporo Ichiban's Yakisoba Japanese Style Noodles Chowmein</b> for a second attempt.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" /></p><p>The first time failed for some reason. I don't remember why. I do remember it's runny meat taste, though. This time, I added in some salt to compensate. My parent's house is fresh out of A1 sauce.</p><p>This stuff isn't all that bad, although it does lack in overall taste. I think the salt helped, but it was still missing an overall wholesome taste. There really wasn't any flavor in the dish. The noodles weren't all that bad, but seemed too sticky. Maybe a weird reactions from the salt? I didn't cook them too long. I dunno.</p><p>Eh, I give Ichiban's Yakisoba Chowmein a disappointing <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. If only the stuff had turned out like how it looks on the wrapper. At least the Nong Shim stuff tastes how it looks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Spring Break Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/break-time">Spring Break Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Also, I bought a frame yesterday to showcase all of my ramen wrappers. I don't have enough to make the image look good, though, so I gotta eat more!</p><p>Today I had some more Korean delight! <b>Nong Shim's Oriental Style Noodle Chajang Myun</b>, which was pretty damn good.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_chajang.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_chajang.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_chajang.webp" /></p><p>Since I am back home, I had access to my parent's pots and pans, so I was able to cook ramen the proper way. First, I used my bowl to correct measure the amount of water needed. I boiled it using the stove. Once it reacher it's boiling point, I submerged the noodles. After nearly a minute, I added an egg to the top, and added the thee pouches of seasoning. I let it simmer for a while as I stirred for about 4 minutes. After which, I dumped the contents of the pot into my bowl.</p><p>This has got to be the best method to make this ramen because the soup tasted so rich and bold. This had to be the intended method. The only problem was that the noodle needed to be cooked a tad longer, I think. Since I boiled the noodles with the seasoning, the noodles soaked in the flavor of the soup base perfectly. This brought the whole taste of the ramen together completely. So good!</p><p>I give Nong Shim Chajang Myun noodles a <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Almost perfect! Though, I'm sure fans of the chajang myun flavor would give it a 5. I think the beef taste of the soup was a bit runny. Maybe I'll go get some A1 Sauce at the store and dump that in next time. I wonder what that would taste link.  Man, Steak Ramen would be amazing.</p><p>Anyway, lots to do!

I've certainly gotten the hang of using the new microwave. 5 minutes of boiling water. Then, add the noodles to the water. Then, add the veggies and some of the seasoning. Mix it around, and then add the egg into it. Mix it up some more, and then add some more of the seasoning. Mix again. And complete with the rest of the seasoning on top, without mixing. Put it back in the microwave for 3 minutes. Stop and stir once, and that's it.</p><p>This stuff is so good. There's just the right blend of spiciness added to the fullness of the ramen broth. And the noodles tastes perfect, too. I think I cooked it exactly the way the company intended. I give Champong Noodles a <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>! </p><p>Definitely check this one out! I think this is the best ramen in the world made by Nong Shim. I plan to stock up next time I'm at Mitsuwa.</p><p>I still have a few more Nong Shim left on my shelf. So, next, I had <b>Nong Shim's Hot & Spicy Ansungtangmyun Noodle Soup.</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ansungtangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ansungtangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ansungtangmyun.webp" /></p><p>Otherwise known as the ramen with the Tanuki on the wrapper.</p><p>This stuff was also very good, but it was missing the little things that made the previous ramen so great. For one, the noodle's were in the shape of a square rather than a convenient cirlce. For two, there was no packet of veggies to add more flavor to the soup.</p><p>That was totally fine, though. These noodle's were still top notch. Just what I've come to expect from Nong Shim. The seasoning made the broth very bold and tasty, too. Though, it was not as spicy as advertised. I give Ansungtangmyun Noodles a <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playing Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playing-catchup">Playing Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm not sure, but I'm back.</p><p>Today, I had some <b>5-Minute Express Instant Ramen Noodles Pork Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/express_pork.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/express_pork.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/express_pork.webp" /></p><p>This stuff is pretty funny. First, I bought it from the local Dollar store for 20 cents. And second, it's made in Canada. The package is rather bland. Although, the seasoning package has the word "Porc" on it, whatever animal that is.</p><p>Oh yes, I remember why I took a break from ramen. Our microwave boke and it was only until recently that we got a new one. This is the second instant noodle meal I made on it. I think the voltage is weaker. It doesn't cook the meal as hot as the previous microwave. I'm starting to get the hang of it, though. For the 5-minute Express Noodles, I cooked them an additional 2 1/2 minutes after putting everything in the bowl.</p><p>The noodles tasted exactly like the Maruchan noodles and the Top Ramen noodles. I give 'em a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>, or whatever grade I gave the other ramen. Not bad, although the Top Ramen was 3.33 cents cheaper.</p><p>---</p><p>Next, yesterday, I finally the <b>Sapporo Ichican Yakisoba Japanese Style Noodles Chow Mein</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" /></p><p>I got this one from Mitsuwa, and it looked very tasty on the wrapper.</p><p>Being the first ramen made with the new microwave, I think I undercooked it a bit. After I cooked the meal, the soup base tasted very watery. It was like the seasoning didn't even mix well in the water. Ick. The noodles weren't fantastic either. Nothing special. I give Ichiban's Yakisoba <b>1 out of 5 stars</b>. Blech. Hopefully this weekend, I'll get another one and try it out under better conditions.</p><p>---</p><p>Also, a while ago, I had <b>Sunlee Instant Noodle Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sunlee_chicken.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sunlee_chicken.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sunlee_chicken.webp" /></p><p>This came in a fun little bowl, completed with an expandable fork to use.</p><p>If I remember correctly, it tasted pretty good. Instant meals that came in a bowl don't really give you a lot of noodles. But, the chicken flavor blended nicely with the noodles and the soup base. I give it <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. It was pretty good, although expensive. ^_^</p><p>---</p><p>Another bowled ramen I had a while ago was <b>Golden Boy Instant Mung Bean Vermicelli Crab Soup</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/goldenboy_crab.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/goldenboy_crab.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/goldenboy_crab.webp" /></p><p>I had been looking forward to this one. I love crab meat, so I was excited to see what the Instant Meal industry could do with such flavor. The bowl also came with its own little fork, and also came with a small portion of noodles.</p><p>Overall, I was disappointed. The soup base didn't resemble Crab at all. And the vermicelli, as usual, broke apart as I grabbed the noodles with chopsticks. The noodles still tasted pretty good, though. ^_^</p><p>I give Golden Boy's Instant Crab Vermicelli <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>. Maybe Crab just isn't first for Instant meals.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock Recipe #1" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-recipe-1">Schlock Recipe #1</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Turn on your Pizzazz, set to dual, and put a tortilla in the center.  Wait a little while for it to brown and then flip it over.</p><p>2. Put some cheese on the tortilla, and spread evenly.  Apply meat/chicken or sauce if you have any.  Wait a little while for it to all melt together.</p><p>3. Put another tortilla on top of the cheese.  Wait a little bit for the tortilla to warm up and brown slightly, then flip.</p><p>4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you run out of cheese and other toppings, or until you run out of tortillas.  Or, until you are satisfied with the amount of food you've made already.  Usually one whole pack of tortillas is a good stopping point.</p><p>5.

| February 9, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight, I had some of the new Ramen I recently purchased. But first, earlier today I tried some cheap stuff from the Dollar Store, <b>Nissin Brand Top Ramen Oodles of Noodles Oriental Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/topramen_oriental.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/topramen_oriental.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/topramen_oriental.webp" /></p><p>It tastes nearly exactly like the Maruchan brand stuff. It's a little cheaper, though. Maruchan brand ramen is 5 for a dollar. Top Ramen is 6 for a dollar. Maruchan has more diversity in flavors, though.</p><p>Anyway, the flavor was okay and the noodles were okay. It's about a <b>2 1/2 out of 5</b>, I guess. Pretty crappy, yet edible enough.</p><p>I made another one for dinner and mixed things up by adding two eggs, leftover seasoning from other ramen, and also some bacon bits. This turned out much better. The bacon bits added a little flavor. Although, these bacon bits don't really have any flavor to begin with.</p><p>---</p><p>Tonight's new ramen was one of Korea's finest, <b>Nong Shim Brand Neoguri Noodle Soup Udon, Seafood and Spicy</b>. I could not wait to get home and try it out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" /></p><p>Although, I messed up while making it. Since these udon noodles require no refrigeration, I cooked them like normal noodles. I should have booked the noodles themselves for a couple minutes first, then dumped all the seasoning and veggies in there, and then cooked them again for a few minutes. Instead, I skipped the middle step.</p><p>The noodles certainly DID NOT taste like udon noodles. They tasted like normal dried out instant noodles. Though, that was my fault. I will hold off reviewing this one until I cook it properly. The soup and contents were quite delicious, and the noodles soaked the flavor pretty well, too. The verdict is pending for now.</p><p>I've reviewed enough instant noodles now, that I want to create some kind of collage with the wrappers. I need to find one of those cheap picture frames at the store next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Udon Shrimp..

These were the standard flavor. The Asian food store also had a Hot & Spicy flavored one, too, that I will get to eventually.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_shrimp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_shrimp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_shrimp.webp" /></p><p>I cooked these in the "professional" way. I boiled water in the sauce pan, added the noodles, and boiled them for a while longer. Then, I added the seasoning and an egg. I continued boiling them for a little longer, and then served them in a bowl. </p><p>I definitely used too much water. It's much harder to judge when using a sauce pan compared to my normal pot. Before I try those Hot & Spicy Udon noodles, I might try to microwave the noodles first. Because the noodles are soft in the package, they require refrigeration. So everything is cold compared to the other Instant noodles I've tried.</p><p>Anyway, the egg cooked very nicely in the pan. It was completely even. The soup tasted like egg drop soup! ^_^</p><p>These noodles are very good in the first place, which are rewarded with a <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I think they'd be even better if the seasoning was separated and refined rathen than just a single pack. I did add too much water though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DDR Woes and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ddr-woes-and-ramen">DDR Woes and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I ran out of steam quickly. :/ It's been to long since I played. Unfortunately the series is dead and there are no prospects of it coming back. :(</p><p>In other news, I had two things of noodles today.</p><p>First off, <b>Mama Brand Instant Rice Vermicelli Tom Yam Koon Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_tomyamkoong.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_tomyamkoong.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_tomyamkoong.webp" /></p><p>It didn't taste too much different than the normal tom yum flavor. This stuff is rice vermicelli, which are string-like noodles with absolute no taste. I don't think they're all that great in the first place. Adding an egg didn't really help out this one much. It only added to the soup, which still ended up bland. Maybe if you like Rice Vermicelli it's okay? I'm giving it <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>Next, I ate some <b>Myojo Brand Instant Noodle Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/myojo_chicken.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/myojo_chicken.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/myojo_chicken.webp" /></p><p>Ugh.. I ripped the package..</p><p>Now THIS stuff is crap. The noodles were extremely plastic tasting. They did not cook right and gathered no flavor. It's good if you like really bad ramen, but I think anyone would agree this is too bad. <b>1 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>I don't think I'm going to eat anymore ramen for a while. I only have Rice Vermicelli and Chand noodles left, all of which are crap. Perhaps only if I have a hungry emergency.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Viewtiful Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/viewtiful-ramen">Viewtiful Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This game has style! </p><p>Nostalgia plays into the story, as the main character is a huge fan of old superhero movies, and then becomes one after being sucked into it. Viewtiful is a classic side-scrolling platformer, so nostalgia also plays into the gameplay. Though, not just any side-scroller, a CAPCOM side-scroller! It gave me fond flashbacks of playing Mega Man back in the day. When you turn into a super hero, you even look like Mega Man a little bit ^_^</p><p>Beyond that, the game is really difficult, too. The learning curve is more of a learning cliff! It's very far, though, which makes it fun and challenging. Today I beat Adult Mode (Normal), so I've unlocked the V-Rated mode (hard difficulty). After that, there's an Ultra V-Rated mode, too. I started playing through V-Rated, and the first level posed no problem at all. The second level is kicking my ass, though.</p><p>Taking a break, I ate <b>Mama Brand Oriental Style Instant Noodle Chand Tom Yum</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_chand_tomyum.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_chand_tomyum.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_chand_tomyum.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't realize it was Chand until now. I don't really like Chand noodles. I think they are too flimsy and they always fall apart.</p><p>These weren't bad, though! After adding everything together, I only cooked it for 45 seconds because of how flimsy the Chand noodles usually are. I though it worked out well, until everything felt apart anyway. Sigh... They still tasted good, though. The Tom Yum flavored soup was pretty good. Quite tasty. So overall, I give these Tom Yum Chand noocldes a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>And now I'm out of eggs, so I will make a sandwich rather than more ramen. I only have Chand noodles left, anyway.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/18">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/16">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (35)
