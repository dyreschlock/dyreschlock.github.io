All those software projects have backed up since my group and I didn't meet last night. Now, we have to scramble today to catch up. We have a lot of work to do in the next week. I have lots of assignments due tomorrow, too. @_@</p><p>Sigh, but in other news, I had some more ramen this afternoon. Some pretty good stuff, too!</p><p>First off, I had <b>Samyang Brand Sutah Ramen Rich Hot Flavor</b>.</p><p>I saw this package, and I immediately thought, "Holy shit! This is what I'm having today!" Although, I am skeptical now when making Samyang ramen. All their previous ones had turned into sludge, and this is not what I want. Maybe this one would have, too, but I made some corrections. After placing the noodles in the water, I added a little more water. It cooled down the boil, but I let it sit for a few minutes.</p><p>This meal was quite extensive, like the Nong Shim stuff. There was a pouch of soup base, a pouch for the veggies, and another pouch of solid base. I put the solid base in the water first. A little alter, I added the veggies, soup base, and an egg, too.</p><p>This stuff turn out FANTASTIC! Extremely delicious. I was surprised. Although, it makes sense given the quality of packaging and ingredients. It was pretty hot & spicy, but just right for my taste buds. The noodles and seasoning blended perfectly together for the slightly baked taste. Great stuff! I give Sutah Ramen a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Nice job!</p><p>Secondly, I had <b>Nissin Brand Instant Noodles Prawn Flavor</b>.</p><p>Prawn is another specie of Shrimp, by the way. This ramen is also known as the one with the little ramen guy running around on the cover.</p><p>I am a little biased towards Seafood flavored noodles because I LOVE seafood quite a lot. And this stuff totally delivered on the taste. Very seafood-esq. Though, the overall quality of the dish was similar to the cheapness of Maruchan and other American brand noodles. Chucks of crab may have saved this dish, so maybe I'll try that next time.</p><p>Anywho, I give this one a <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. It wasn't bad, but it lacked in overall style and deliciousness.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ramen Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ramen-catchup">Ramen Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 5, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After finally getting caught up with everything in my school life, I started cooking up some of the ramen that I acquired over the weekend.</p><p>First off, I made <b>Nong Shim Brand Neoguri Udon Noodle Soup Seafood & Spicy</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" /></p><p>This was a dish I had made before, but I didn't grade it. I think I fucked up making it or something. They are supposed to be udon noodles, so making them in the microwave is a bit tricky. It takes a lot longer for the noodles to absorb the boiling water and soften. Now, it's no longer a problem for me because I'm using a stovetop. Cooking ramen over heat is the absolute best way to get the best taste out of the instant noodles.</p><p>This stuff was quite good this time. I don't remember how it ended up last time. Probably, the noodles were still hard and tasted funny. Not this time, though. The noodles absorbed the water and seasoning beautifully, and tasted so delicious. The soup was also quite delicious. The perfect blend of spice, veggies, and egg. No ramen sludge. I give Nong Shim's Seafood & Spicy Udon Noodles a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Extremely delicious! And extemely recommended.</p><p>---</p><p>Next up, to counter the Korean excellent, I went with the instant bowled <b>Nissin Brand UFO Yakisoba Oriental Noodle w/ Soup Base</b>.</p><p>Yes, UFO as in Unidentified Flying Object, as spelling out on the cover. I don't get it, but this stuff was certainly NOT out of this world.</p><p>It's not possible to make Yakisoba how it was illustrated on the cover. It can only end up being noodles with yakisoba flavoring. And the yakisoba flavoring tasted like runny meat. It wasn't as bad as that Ichiban Yakisoba, though. This stuff didn't have that crappy taste, and it pulled itself together a little bit. Someone who actually liked yakisoba would proably like it. I give UFO Yakisoba a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I don't think it's possible to make a truly good instant Yakisoba.</p><p>---</p><p>And finally, last week sometime, I made <b>Myojo Brand Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Crab Flavor</b>.</p><p>Speaking of noodles you can't possibly translate into an instant meal, udon noodles will never turn out how they are supposed to. Completely absorbent of their seasoning and meat products soaked in the soup. I tried to boil them longer with the soup base in the broth, but it just doesn't work.</p><p>None the less, this stuff didn't turn out too bad. I find it really odd how well eggs break up in the soup base when making these refrigerated instant meals. It's really weird. Also weird, this stuff tasted nothing like crab. It tasted more like that Chicken flavor in the Maruchan brand ramen. Next time I make this stuff, I certainly must add in that immitation crab they sell at my local grocer. That'll prove to be a delicious meal. But, in the mean time, Myogo Udon Noodles gets a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Better luck next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Daily Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/daily-work-and-ramen">Daily Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, it's still early in the week, and I've got plenty of time to do everything. I plan to jet over to Madison tomorrow to do some banking, but I can't stay there for too long. I gotta get back and get stuff done!</p><p>Today for lunch, I filled up with <b>Samyang Brand Sogokimyun Ramen</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" /></p><p>This stuff ended up just like the previous Samyang Ramen...  Sludge. I added a little more water this time, but still, it ended up in sludge. Although, it was very tasty sludge. Pretty good, in fact. It had a very robust strong flavor. Not all THAT great, but pretty good. <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>BUT! After that, I had <b>Sapporo Ichiban Brand Kitsune Japanese Style Noodle</b> with Fried Bean Curd & Soup Base.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" /></p><p>This stuff...  I can't began to describe this stuff. It began looking promising. But, the hint of beef in the seasoning prepared me for a runny meat texture. Cooking the stuff wasn't so bad. The noodles were shaped into a square, but not in a manufactured way, like the Maruchan stuff. The noodles were fatter than regular noodles, too. They seemed to be randomly arranged, but broke apart in the boiling water nicely.</p><p>Inside, with the soup base, there was a chunk of fried bean curd. I'm not very judgey when it comes to food, so I threw it all in the dish. I don't konw if it was supposed to break apart in the water, but it did not. It stayed together as one big chunk while it cooked and even after. Actually, looking at the wrapper, maybe I'm supposed to cut it out.  Oops. I put the whole thing in my mouth and took a bite. *BARF* Ugh. I can't desribe how terrible this stuff tasted. I think the closest taste I could compare it to is vomit. At least, that's exactly how my mouth tasted after I spit it into the garbage. Maybe it's better when cut?? DO NOT eat that thing whole.</p><p>Even after that, the ramen did have that runny beef texture I had prepared for. The noodles were really good, though. I give this one a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Sapporo Ichiban has potential, but I don't know why they keep fucking up. There must be an excellent Ichiban Ramen combination out there. This will be my future goal when I return to the Asian market.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM Trip and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-trip-and-ramen">SPAMM Trip and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 28, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The SPAMM trip yesterday to Madison was very enjoyable. We went to the Korean Market, which had a whole aisle of instant noodles! KOREAN instant noodles. The best kind! I bought some bean sprouts and a bunch of ramen for $7.24. The concluded with our dinner at Ginza. I didn't order too much (only $12). It worked out because other folks ordered too much, and I ate their food.</p><p>Then, we returned back to Platteville to the SPAMM house, drank, and played Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.</p><div class='title'><b>Later...</b></div><p>Even though I skimped on food in Madison, I've totally blown my food budget for the month. I mean, I have enough food to last for a while, but I really need to pay attention to how much I spend.</p><p>Anywho, with this in mind, let's eat some ramen! Tonight I began with <b>Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" /></p><p>There were very helpful instructions on the back: <br/>Step 1 - Boil Noodles<br/>Step 2 - Cook in the Soup Base and Veggies<br/>Step 3 - Cook in the Solid Base (and add an egg and whatever else)</p><p>This is now my preferred method of cooking noodles.</p><p>Perhaps the most underrated feature of Nong Shim instant noodles is that noodles come in a circular disk, rather than a square. It breaks apart in the water naturally. AND it actually fits in the pot perfectly. Square noodles have an awkward shape that I need to squish into my pot. Also, square noodles don't really break apart naturally. There are always chunks stuck together, which tear the noodles. Circular noodles stay fit, so you'll have one continuous noodle in the end. ^_^</p><p>Secondly, the veggies from Nong Shim complement the taste of the soup perfectly. So delicious. I added in some bean sprouts and an egg to this ramen, and they soaked up my of the broth's flavor.</p><p>Overall, this stuff was exteremely delicious. I give Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Don't miss this stuff! If you live in Madison, but the 5-pack. I think it was only $3!</p><p>After the delicious stuff, I tried a different brand rather than eating all of my Nong Shim stuff on the first day. I went with <b>Samyang Foods Brand Kimchee Ramen</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" /></p><p>It was rather interesting, much like the preview Ottogi Brand Jin Ramen. I don't know if it's the noodles, the soup base, or the amount of water or heat, but the whole thing came out like sludge. Very heavy. I cooked it the same way as the Nong Shim Brand stuff, but it came out as sludge.</p><p>Ramen sludge isn't all that different than normal ramen. The taste is still there. The noodles stick together a little bit, so it's difficult to pull them apart while you eat.</p><p>It wasn't bad, though. Still better than normal American noodles. Although, it cannot stand up against the Nong Shim excellence. I gave Samyang's Kimchee a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Good effort, mate! Perhaps I should try again and avoid the sludge to experience what you were going.</p><div class='title'><b>Later yet...</b></div><p>I played a lot of DDR Revivial tonight. I was so hungry that I couldn't go to bed, so I made some of the refrigerated udon noodles, <b>Chikara Brand Udon Hot & Spicy Oriental Style Noodes</b>. I bought them a while ago.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" /></p><p>Hot & Spicy is the over statement of the century here. Although, not surprising from an American company.</p><p>These turned out pretty good, but there's got to be a better way to cook them. Udon noodles are supposed to absorb the taste and have a meaty structure. These noodles were very watery with little taste. I don't get it. Although, because of this, the egg breaks up more naturally compared with cooking the dried out instant noodles. Almost like egg drop soup. ^_^</p><p>Overall, I give Chikara's Udon Spicy Noodles a <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>. These noodles never seem to turn out right, and I'm probably not the reason. I will need to experiment further next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Underground and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-underground-and-ramen">The Underground and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Sutekh performed a Live PA at the Dinky Towner near the U of M. The Ad said No DJs, and they were very right. The main "headliners" performed a variety of crazy stuff. There was a looping box hooked up to a Megaphone, a hard hooked up to a sampling machine, drums, and, of course, gameboys. </p><p>It was crazy experimental compared to what I normally listen to. Wicked as hell and all over the place. The Dinky Towner was incredibly down to earth compared with the million dollar clubs of downtown Chicago and Minneapolis. Very underground.

We went to Vital Vinyl and Let it Be records to look for new events and records. I bought Sasha's Xpander XP, and Luke Chable's remix of Cloud Cookoo. Beautiful remix to a beautiful song. We also went to an arcade. They didn't have F-Zero AX, but they did have DDR Extreme.</p><p>On our way home, it began to snow. Then the snow turned into a fricken blizzard! Man, this is so great.

It was so good. Learning from ramen yesterday, I let these noodles cook longer before adding the seasoning and egg, and it paid off excellenetly! After the water boiled in the pot, I added the noodles. I cooked and stirred them until they felt cooked. Then I added the egg. I stirred in the egg, and allowed the water to boil again. After properly mixed, I added in the seasoning and the veggies. I continued to stir and cook them for a little while longer, and then served them in my bowl.</p><p>Man, I think my taste buds have grown accustomed to the Nong Shim spice. It was spicy, but I was easy able to handle it. The soup base tasted excellent. It was a very pure blend of spice and sea that worked very well together. Boiling the noodles with the base brought the taste into the noodles, which got rid of the bland dried-up taste.</p><p>I give Nong Shim's Ramyum a generous <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. It was excellent. But perfect? I think that'd be too much.</p><p>---</p><p>Next, I took on <b>Sapporo Ichiban's Yakisoba Japanese Style Noodles Chowmein</b> for a second attempt.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" /></p><p>The first time failed for some reason. I don't remember why. I do remember it's runny meat taste, though. This time, I added in some salt to compensate. My parent's house is fresh out of A1 sauce.</p><p>This stuff isn't all that bad, although it does lack in overall taste. I think the salt helped, but it was still missing an overall wholesome taste. There really wasn't any flavor in the dish. The noodles weren't all that bad, but seemed too sticky. Maybe a weird reactions from the salt? I didn't cook them too long. I dunno.</p><p>Eh, I give Ichiban's Yakisoba Chowmein a disappointing <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. If only the stuff had turned out like how it looks on the wrapper. At least the Nong Shim stuff tastes how it looks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Spring Break Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/break-time">Spring Break Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Also, I bought a frame yesterday to showcase all of my ramen wrappers. I don't have enough to make the image look good, though, so I gotta eat more!</p><p>Today I had some more Korean delight! <b>Nong Shim's Oriental Style Noodle Chajang Myun</b>, which was pretty damn good.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_chajang.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_chajang.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_chajang.webp" /></p><p>Since I am back home, I had access to my parent's pots and pans, so I was able to cook ramen the proper way. First, I used my bowl to correct measure the amount of water needed. I boiled it using the stove. Once it reacher it's boiling point, I submerged the noodles. After nearly a minute, I added an egg to the top, and added the thee pouches of seasoning. I let it simmer for a while as I stirred for about 4 minutes. After which, I dumped the contents of the pot into my bowl.</p><p>This has got to be the best method to make this ramen because the soup tasted so rich and bold. This had to be the intended method. The only problem was that the noodle needed to be cooked a tad longer, I think. Since I boiled the noodles with the seasoning, the noodles soaked in the flavor of the soup base perfectly. This brought the whole taste of the ramen together completely. So good!</p><p>I give Nong Shim Chajang Myun noodles a <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Almost perfect! Though, I'm sure fans of the chajang myun flavor would give it a 5. I think the beef taste of the soup was a bit runny. Maybe I'll go get some A1 Sauce at the store and dump that in next time. I wonder what that would taste link.  Man, Steak Ramen would be amazing.</p><p>Anyway, lots to do!

I've certainly gotten the hang of using the new microwave. 5 minutes of boiling water. Then, add the noodles to the water. Then, add the veggies and some of the seasoning. Mix it around, and then add the egg into it. Mix it up some more, and then add some more of the seasoning. Mix again. And complete with the rest of the seasoning on top, without mixing. Put it back in the microwave for 3 minutes. Stop and stir once, and that's it.</p><p>This stuff is so good. There's just the right blend of spiciness added to the fullness of the ramen broth. And the noodles tastes perfect, too. I think I cooked it exactly the way the company intended. I give Champong Noodles a <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>! </p><p>Definitely check this one out! I think this is the best ramen in the world made by Nong Shim. I plan to stock up next time I'm at Mitsuwa.</p><p>I still have a few more Nong Shim left on my shelf. So, next, I had <b>Nong Shim's Hot & Spicy Ansungtangmyun Noodle Soup.</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ansungtangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ansungtangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ansungtangmyun.webp" /></p><p>Otherwise known as the ramen with the Tanuki on the wrapper.</p><p>This stuff was also very good, but it was missing the little things that made the previous ramen so great. For one, the noodle's were in the shape of a square rather than a convenient cirlce. For two, there was no packet of veggies to add more flavor to the soup.</p><p>That was totally fine, though. These noodle's were still top notch. Just what I've come to expect from Nong Shim. The seasoning made the broth very bold and tasty, too. Though, it was not as spicy as advertised. I give Ansungtangmyun Noodles a <b>4 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playing Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playing-catchup">Playing Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 12, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I took a little break from eating Ramen for a while. I'm not sure, but I'm back.</p><p>Today, I had some <b>5-Minute Express Instant Ramen Noodles Pork Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/express_pork.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/express_pork.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/express_pork.webp" /></p><p>This stuff is pretty funny. First, I bought it from the local Dollar store for 20 cents. And second, it's made in Canada. The package is rather bland. Although, the seasoning package has the word "Porc" on it, whatever animal that is.</p><p>Oh yes, I remember why I took a break from ramen. Our microwave boke and it was only until recently that we got a new one. This is the second instant noodle meal I made on it. I think the voltage is weaker. It doesn't cook the meal as hot as the previous microwave. I'm starting to get the hang of it, though. For the 5-minute Express Noodles, I cooked them an additional 2 1/2 minutes after putting everything in the bowl.</p><p>The noodles tasted exactly like the Maruchan noodles and the Top Ramen noodles. I give 'em a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>, or whatever grade I gave the other ramen. Not bad, although the Top Ramen was 3.33 cents cheaper.</p><p>---</p><p>Next, yesterday, I finally the <b>Sapporo Ichican Yakisoba Japanese Style Noodles Chow Mein</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/ichiban_yakisoba.webp" /></p><p>I got this one from Mitsuwa, and it looked very tasty on the wrapper.</p><p>Being the first ramen made with the new microwave, I think I undercooked it a bit. After I cooked the meal, the soup base tasted very watery. It was like the seasoning didn't even mix well in the water. Ick. The noodles weren't fantastic either. Nothing special. I give Ichiban's Yakisoba <b>1 out of 5 stars</b>. Blech. Hopefully this weekend, I'll get another one and try it out under better conditions.</p><p>---</p><p>Also, a while ago, I had <b>Sunlee Instant Noodle Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sunlee_chicken.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sunlee_chicken.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sunlee_chicken.webp" /></p><p>This came in a fun little bowl, completed with an expandable fork to use.</p><p>If I remember correctly, it tasted pretty good. Instant meals that came in a bowl don't really give you a lot of noodles. But, the chicken flavor blended nicely with the noodles and the soup base. I give it <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. It was pretty good, although expensive. ^_^</p><p>---</p><p>Another bowled ramen I had a while ago was <b>Golden Boy Instant Mung Bean Vermicelli Crab Soup</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/goldenboy_crab.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/goldenboy_crab.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/goldenboy_crab.webp" /></p><p>I had been looking forward to this one. I love crab meat, so I was excited to see what the Instant Meal industry could do with such flavor. The bowl also came with its own little fork, and also came with a small portion of noodles.</p><p>Overall, I was disappointed. The soup base didn't resemble Crab at all. And the vermicelli, as usual, broke apart as I grabbed the noodles with chopsticks. The noodles still tasted pretty good, though. ^_^</p><p>I give Golden Boy's Instant Crab Vermicelli <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>. Maybe Crab just isn't first for Instant meals.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/18">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/miscellanous/16">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
