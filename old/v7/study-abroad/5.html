| September 14, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today i had the day to myself.  Five was off at work, and left me with my amazing surroundings.  So i began my walk.  Five pointed out this sign to me yesterday when we arrived:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01635.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01635.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01635.webp" /></p><p>With some spooky guy trying to get the women.  Five translated as best he could, "don't walk alone at night".</p><p>Anyways, one place i planned on going was the shrine of 26 matyrs around the corner.  Here's an alright panaromic shot of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01664.webp">shrine</a>.  There were a bunch of stray cats hanging around on the benches and nearby.  I wasn't exactly sure where they had been, so i didn't play around with them too much.</p><p>The shrine of 26 matyrs is there to honor 20 japanese and 6 foreignors who were slain defending the name of Christanity.  Around the corner was the church this shrine was dedicated to:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01640.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01640.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01640.webp" /></p><p>The shrine also featured a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01644.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01644.webp">map</a>, which i thought was quite helpful.</p><p>Before i went any further, i forgot five's number back at the apartment.  "I should probably go back and get that, JUST in case," i thought to myself.</p><p>here's a pic on the way back:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01667.webp" /></p><p>and a pretty little house on the corner:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01668.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01668.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01668.webp" /></p><p>As i ventured out again, i took another panoramic shot off a balcony beside the road: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01686.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01686.webp">here</a>.  Nagasaki is so beautiful.  There's so much stuff.  So many houses and residence.  America just seems so plain now.</p><p>I got back out to the main nagasaki road to look around for some food.  I found this in a vending machine:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01690.webp" /></p><p>Deeppresso, the coffee that causes depression.</p><p>I saw five's apartment from the street too: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01691.webp">here</a>.  It's that little blue one near the center of the pic.  here's some other random pics:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01693.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01693.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01701.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01701.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01701.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01702.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01704.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01704.webp" /></p><p>I finally found a convience store of sorts.  I picked up some Onigiri and grape juice.  I couldn't eat them right there, so i decided to go back to the apartment.  On the way back i snapped some pics of the gas station prices:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01707.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01707.webp" /></p><p>Regular is 147 yen per liter.  2.5 liters is about one gallon, isn't it?  That's about 375 yen per gallon then.  So gas is about $3.50 here.  $1 more.  I really wonder how much gas mileage some of these car get.  Most of them look pretty futuristic ^_^.</p><p>One really odd then i've noticed from the moment i got to Japan, is that all the cars are pretty much new.  I haven't seen a single car that looks older than 5 years, except for the taxi cabs.  Everyone drives something that's actually pleasant to the eyes, rather than some crappy ass car you find all over the US.  It seems like Japan actually has standards when it comes to these things.  All the more reason to pick up a Prius when i get back.</p><p>Also when i was out I found several Beer vending machines:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01713.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01713.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01713.webp" /></p><p>This one has those gigantic cans that i saw at the grocery store yesterday.  So... once i got back, i snacked on my Onigiri and checked the internet again.  It was a good rest considering i've been walking up and down hills to get everywhere.</p><p>__</p><p>Once fully rested, i departed for the department store to look for games and things.  My mission got somewhat side tracked when i came across this staircase:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01714.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01714.webp" /><br/>This sign said 'Shrine this way', so i figured this would definately be awesome:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01716.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01716.webp" /></p><p>and i wasn't dissapointed ^_^.  here's a panorama of the base: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01736.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01736.webp">here</a>.  This shrine was the center of a pretty massive grave yard, nested within the heart of the neighborhood.  There were plenty of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01737.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01737.webp">decorated graves</a> about the place.</p><p>I went up the side of the staircase, and took another <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01759.webp">panoramic shot</a>, or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01764.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01764.webp">two</a>.  Off to the side, there was a massive staircase, just begging me to climb it:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01767.webp" /></p><p>Which gave me a better view ^_^.  It was getting closer and closer to this massive statue i've seen from the distance:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01769.webp" /></p><p>That's as close as i got to it though.  Maybe tomorrow, i'll go over to that shrine.  I continued up the staircase, and took <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01777.webp">plenty more</a> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01794.webp">panoramic shots</a>.  I kept climbing and climbing and climbing.  I turned around to see how far i've gone:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01795.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01795.webp" /></p><p>Good lord..  and there were still plenty left to go.  I think by the time i come back, i'm going to be in pretty good physical shape.</p><p>I finally made it to the top, and i whipped out my camera for some more <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01812.webp">panoramic action</a>.  So.. now i was right next to the White Hotel building that has been in my other panoramic shots.  ALLLLL the way at the top of hill/mountain.  I turned around to see what was on the other side of the mountain..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01813.webp" /></p><p>holy crap.. more city.  I took out my camera and took more panoramic shots: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01821.webp">one</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01829.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01829.webp">two</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01845.webp">three</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01872.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01872.webp">four</a>.  I stopped off at a convience store to buy some water because i was so tired at this point.</p><p>I continued forth, though.  I found another staircase that lead up to the top of the next hill.  It lead up to an empty baseball field.  Off to the side was a scenic overlook, but you couldn't really see anything with all the trees in the way.  I figured at this point i took enough pictures and was tired enough to warrant a visit back and the apartment.</p><p>___</p><p>Japanese people are so cute ^_^.  I mean, besides the girl's being hot, the older folk have been quite nice.  Whenever when someone walked passed me, or noticed me, i would smile and nod and they would always smile and nod back the same way.  Quite friendly ^_^</p><p>When i went into the rural convience store, the guy on the counter figured that i had no idea what he was saying and pointed out the cost of my purchase in a very instructional way, like i couldn't read numbers or something.</p><p>That wasn't so easy earlier on that day with the other convience store which didn't have a display counter.  I heard the cost quite clearly, ä¸?ç?¾ä¸?å??, but i kinda choked.  San byaku..  what the hell is byaku.  it's 300 something..  eh, screw it, i'll just give her a 500 coin.  when i saw the 8, it clicked.  I forgot about all those crazy conversions with 4 and 8.</p><p>The whole trip i was just waiting for some little kids to run up to me and start talking to me or making fun of me or something.  I knew it was going to happen eventually.  On my way back to the apartment the second time, there were these 3 little girls playing around outside this playground.  They were looking at something intently, so i scuttled past unnoticed.</p><p>One of them noticed me, and the whole little group started following me wondering what the hell was up with me.  Before i turned down the corner towards the apartment, i turned around to see what they were up to.  They had this "what the fuck" look on their faces that was pretty funny.  I made some faces at them, but it didn't seem to stun them anymore than they already were.</p><p>Anyways, nagasaki is rather tiring.  I spent a good 6 hours walking up and down hills today, and then another 3 hours going through all the pictures.  I would clean up those panoramic pictures a little more, but that takes too much time at the moment.  I don't want to stay in the apartment all day long editing photos.  Though, next time i'll probably rotate them so the pictures fit together a bit better.</p><p>Not all the pics i took today are shown, but all the good ones can be found here: http://www.theschlock.com/photo/060914_stuff/<a href="/old/v7/nagasaki-day-one" title="/nagasaki-day-one" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nagasaki" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nagasaki">Nagasaki</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Once we got to nagasaki, i had to lug my luggage up this huge hill to get to five's apartment.  He kept complaining about how small his apartment is, and to not expect much.</p><p>So when i got inside his apartment, it was actually alot bigger than i thought it would be.  It was thinking it'd be as small the hotel room we stayed at the previous night.  It's actually pretty much as big as the place i was living over the summer in madison ^_^.  Though, there's absolutely no counter space to prepare food.  Apparently five eats out everyday because of this.  so far i've spent about $10-$15 on food per day.</p><p>That's pretty pricey if this trend continues for my 100 day stay.  Though, the amount of money i will get back from living in a dorm rather than a host family will pretty much cover that, so i think i'm good to go.  Once i get used to buying groceries, and preparing them i can start thinking about cheaping out for food.<br/>After dumping my luggage off at his place and hanging out for a short while, we ventured forth again to show me around this area a little bit, and to get my laptop and adapter.</p><p>Even though, Japan uses a very similar power current to the US, all of their outlets have the two prongs.  None of them have three prongs like all of our top end electronics.  Not that a third leg is really useful anyways, it just keeps you from falling down as easy.</p><p>the first place we stopped at was called london park, his local arcade.  They had plenty of fighters and shooters there, along with an entire wall of bemani games.  the Beatmania II Dx machine was huge:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01621.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01621.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01621.webp" /></p><p>although, five said it was actually rather cheap compared to the high-end arcades around.  But, we found what i was looking for: DDR SuperNova.</p><p>Before i dumped in my 100å?? coin, five brought me around the corner to this card dispenser.  You can pay 400å?? and receive your Konami e-Amusement Pass that most konami games read.  I put my card in DDR SuperNova and registered my name and location.  We couldn't find America quick enough, so i'm register under Nagasaki.</p><p>This card will keep track of ALL your scores you get when you complete songs.  I cycled through the song list, and chose songs that popped out at me as being interesting.  I found a remix of Seduction (from DDRex2), Des-row had a new song, and then a chose this catchy tune, AA, by dj amuero.  I don't think i made it 20% through the list of songs, and i had heard of none of these songs before.  Maybe i didn't get far enough to the songs from previous versions.  Also, i didn't check to see which songs were red.  I'll do that soon enough though.</p><p>We went to the department store right after this because it was getting late, and we didn't want it to the close before we got there.  We looked around a bit at some of the stuff.  Found this somewhat <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01622.webp">funny tshirt</a> and a display for the japanese release of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01624.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01624.webp">LOST</a>.<br/>We found a power adapter, picked up a blanket, and some food.  Check out what i ate:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01633.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01633.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01633.webp" /></p><p>I said to myself, "something this horribly revolting has got to be good."  It wasn't the best thing i've had, though.  It tasted like sweet soft cooked mushrooms.</p><p>While at the grocery store, i found some Superman cereal: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01630.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01630.webp">Frosted Flakes</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01631.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01631.webp">Corn Flakes</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01632.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01632.webp">Bran Falkes</a>.  The awesome knows no bounds.  It came out in theaters a few weeks ago over here, and five expressed interest in seeing it as well. ^_^</p><p>There was also gigantic beer cans with air compressors to keep it cold:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01628.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01628.webp" /></p><p>Unlike that crappy Japanese Sapporo beer i had at the SPAMM Beer fest, this stuff doesn't look like it was brewed in Canada.  In fact, i haven't seen any beer that looks like what i had bought for the Beer fest.  It appears that i was ripped off.</p><p>__</p><p>Anyways, so far has been pretty fantastic.  I woke up today and looked out the window to this:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01634.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01634.webp" /></p><p>Today he's gone working in Omura from 10 AM to 11 PM, so i've got the whole day to myself pretty much.  There is a shrine right around the corner we passed several times on our way back up here.  Today, i can really test if 'fending for myself' is as easy as i think it is from my previous posts.</p><p>A mailman came to the door earlier, and i had no idea what he said.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fukuoka" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fukuoka">Fukuoka</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, #five and i shopped around Fukuoka a bit before heading over to Nagasaki, our final destination.</p><p>Our prime shopping destination was Yodobashi, the massive near-by electronics store.  It was pretty much like a sears, except all electronics on 4 floors.  The first floor had cellphones, TVs and DVDs.  The TVs were quite beautiful.  They had these gigantic flat LCD ones for under $1000.  When i first walked over to the area, i noticed that the TVs featured some guy kiteboarding... O_o. Unfortunately, i was unable to get my camera out in time to snap a shot of the illustrious sport.</p><p>The DVD section was...  well...  a DVD section.  It was pretty much half Anime DVDs, a quarter American movies, and the rest was everything else.  They had a DVD of Evangelion music videos with a kickass cover:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01563.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01563.webp" /></p><p>The shoe is so neat..  i'd love to have running shoes that looked like that.  sadly, that's probably what it would take to get me out and about more.</p><p>I took some pictures of a few others notable things.</p><p>Apparently, the japanese release of Samurai 7 also had a over-sized box which contained little storyboard books, just like the US release: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01565.webp">here</a>.   Respect++ towards Funimation for releasing a semi-authentic product in america.</p><p>The second floor of yodobashi had more of what i was looking for: Games and Toys. ^_^  I found my Rakubiki Jiten without a problem, and picked up a DS Gamecase, which proved to be somewhat disapointing.  Their DS selection was alright.  It was kinda like a Best Buy's game selection, where they have a ton of games, but they are all the most recently released ones.  They didn't have alot of older games.  I'm not really even sure what it'd be looking for though.  They were really promoting the Recipe game Erika posted about on the SPAMM forum.  I also found Rune Factory, Xenosaga I+II, and Children of Mana pretty easily.  I also found that Custom mecha game where all the controls are done using the touch display.  I don't remember the name though, Something Something MS.  I'll probably pick up Rune Factory and the Mech game before i leave if they aren't announced to be released in the US.</p><p>I also found a copy of Zombie Vs. Ambulence on PS2:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01573.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01573.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01573.webp" /></p><p>$19 is not too shabby.  #five and i found some other neat stuff as well: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01574.webp">a Flonne figure</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01577.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01577.webp">a weird snotty kid</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01578.webp">a huge evangelion model kit</a>.  We also checked out cameras and computer things.</p><p>This whole shopping experience really just reminded me of the dealer's room at an anime convention.  It was just a ton of japanese stuff for sale.</p><p>here's yodobashi from the outside:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01582.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01582.webp" /></p><p>and another hastenly put together panaroma of the place: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01590.webp">here</a>.  The building design was rather interesting.  Basement to 3rd Floor was all electronics, and then the 4th and 5th floors were restaurants and convience stores.  The levels above that were all parking, and this side of the building were ramps to get you all the way up there.</p><p>It seems like such a waste of concrete to put your parking above your department store, because you have to use a good 20% of your ground area for parking ramps.  You could have the parking be the first couple of levels, and the stores above instead, then you'd have more surface area per floors.  I really wonder why they put their parking above their stores, rather than underneath.  It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me.</p><p>We walked around the train station a bit to see what else was around.  I was getting a bit thirsty, so i bought some Kirin Water:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01593.webp" /></p><p>Which really wasn't water afterall.  It tasted a lot like a weaker, more delicious Red Bull.</p><p>I noticed a store that had a bunch of CD/DVD signs around it, so i figured they had to have games as well.  We ventured forth.</p><p>The manga section was alot like i thought it would be from what i've seen in anime and j-drama:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01596.webp" /></p><p>Plenty of freeloaders.  Among them i found a used copy of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01597.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01597.webp">Star Fox</a> for the Super Famicon, 4 copies of DDR 1st Mix used for Playstation, A few awesome shooters, all 30 volumes of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01600.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01600.webp">Berserk</a> for $60, and this game which i've wrote about before:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01598.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01598.webp" /></p><p>Yoshinoya is actually a franchise of Fast Food restaurants in Japan.  This would be like if McDonalds made a video game.  You basically manage your own restaurant of Yoshinoya, kinda like Sim-Restaurant.  I can't see what the price tag says in this picture though, i think it was $25 though.  I should've picked it up, considering i had a bit of hitsory with it.</p><p>#five and i were a bit hungry by now.  We went over to the Bus station to get our tickets for Nagasaki, and then went out to eat, and you'll never guess where we went ^_^</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01603.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01603.webp" /></p><p>Yoshinoya. ^_^</p><p>This place is pretty tasty as well.  I bought their pork rice bowl which was 420å??. These posters were all over the place too:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01616.webp" /></p><p>(This was taken later at a different restaurant though)</p><p>#five was telling me that there was a ban for importing Beef from the US and other countries for a little while, but this ban had just been recently lifted for some reason.  This poster says that on September 18th, for one day only, Yoshinoya will be bringing back their Beef Bowl which was ever so popular before they banned Beef from the nation.</p><p>You can be damn sure i'm camping out in front of Yoshinoya early Monday morning to get myself a Beef Bowl.</p><p>Then we took our 2 hour long bus ride over to Nagasaki.  I took a few pictures aboard the Bus, but they turned out like crap..  This one is somewhat ok:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01610.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01610.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01610.webp" /></p><p>___</p><p>Everything felt rather jumbled and squished together in Fukuoka, but after realizing the scale of the city, what the hell was i expecting.  Fukuoka is about the size of Minneapolis with the Population Density of downtown Chicago, so of course everything is going to be jumbled together.  It's a hell of a lot of people in not that big a space.  I should've really researched some of these places before-hand so i knew the scale of what i was getting into.  But... oh well, I learned pretty fast otherwise.  I mean, it was pretty much like being in downtown chicago.  A big city is a big city.</p><p>I dunno, after watching Anime, playing Video Games, reading Japanese, and getting used to seeing, recognizing and operating within the Japanese language, this really isn't all that foreign to me, yet.  It's just a little different, but's it still Earth...  Urban Earth.  Just give me a map and the japanese yellow pages, and i'll find everything i need.</p><p>I suppose one of the biggest reasons i don't feel so lost is the amount of reforms the US did for Japan after World War II, where they gave Japan the blueprints for a democratic urban society.  Also, i'm with #five and he's doing all the japanese conversation, so it's not like i've been alone <_<<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Foreign" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/foreign">Foreign</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>So, on the way here, i realized that i completely forgot to bring over any of my japanese dictionaries.  I was kinda mad at the moment, but then i said to myself, "whatever..  i know some japanese.  i can get around easy without them."  It's been coming back pretty fast, too.  Most of the phrases i think of that i'll probably have to say are things that i already do know how to say.  I just need to remember them.  Things like ã©ã?ã«ã??ã?ãã¾ã?ã¯ just come to mind.</p><p>So far i've really only spoken a little bit of japanese, and that was to a guy who was already speaking to me in English.  He asked me if i knew how to speak Japanese at all, i thought i was being clever by replying: ã?ãã?ã??  But apparently 'little' to him was still far advanced, because i know idea what he said after that to 'test' me.  I've pretty much been speaking to people in english, pretending like i think they understand what i'm saying.  Things like 'excuse me' and 'thank you', which are the first things you learn when studying the language.  I feel like that out of place English guy you see in some Anime.</p><p>I kinda wish that i would've brought just a little more money.  I got 20000å?? for my trip, but i probably should've grabbed $400 worth instead.  I've already used up about $80 of it.  I bought an umbrella ^_^, among other things.</p><p>Also, #five and i checked into this hotel near by, so we could still check out Fukuoka tomorrow instead of going directly back to Nagasaki.  This room is so damn tiny.  I don't know why i was expecting a bigger room when Seb has already shown me pictures of how tiny these places are.  The bathroom is like something you'd find in an RV.  Here's a hastenly put together panaromic shot: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01560.webp">click!</a><br/>When #five and i were checking in, the desk clerk made some comments about my name being Jimmy Hendricks.  Good lord.  "Ah.. Jimmy Hendricks?  Ahaha.  Do you listen to Purple Haze?" It never fails does it <_<</p><p>We're at the Green Hotel 2 at the moment, and apparently when you come into town, the school sets you up in the Green Hotel 1, so #five figures that i haven't really been missing anything so far.</p><p>After we checked in and i had someplace to dump my huge-ass luggage, we were able to walk around town much more freely.  I had slept off and on for the past 7 hours of my flight, so i figured another couple hours of checking out places was fine for my consciousness.</p><p>We went to this little restaurant outside, which was pretty cheap.  Before you come inside, you make your selection from the choices outside in the window.  When you've made your selection, there's a vending machine inside the little restaurant that you dump your change into to pay for the meal.  This machine will output a ticket.  We just found a place to sit, and then you hand over the ticket to the waitress when she notices you.  It completely elimates the need for a cashier at their restaurant, which is a rather novel idea.  Then they only have to focus and cooking and serving.</p><p>Here's what i got:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01550.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01550.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01550.webp" /><br/>It was so good.  I've had something slightly similar to this before, but it, in no way, compares.  man.. i can still taste it.  Good thing food is relatively cheap here, i could easily go broke eating around town.  Mitsuwa's restaurants are pretty representative of Japan, afterall. ^_^<br/>___</p><p>So let's here..  I've bought 4 things so far, and my change is already pilling up.  They have 500å?? and 100å?? coins here (equivalent to $5 and $1), which are used qiute often.  Since their change is in such high denominations, they use vending machines and automated machines for alot of their transactions.  #five states they i'll definately want to pick up a little coin wallet to carry around my change.  I wonder if i can find that little froggie wallet from Naruto around here.</p><p>Also, you need to carry around your passport at all times.  I don't have my 'alien registration' card just yet, so my passport works as a substitution.  If you don't have one of these forms of ID on you, they'll hold you at the police station.  I don't think i'm going to test that one out..</p><p>So far, the idea that i'm in Japan and away from the US hasn't really set it.  I feel like i could drive an hour away from here and be back in familar surroundings.  Having #five here for me, showing me around, and helping me out has been invaluable.  If i truley did come here alone, and had to wait for the Nagasaki representative and have them show me around, i would've been FARRR more nervous.  But, being free of some set schedule and having a guide puts all those little fears to rest.</p><p>Maybe #five and i should come back up here next week and intercept the rest of you guys when you arrive, along with the Nagasaki rep.  Hmm.. but then again, it is 2 hours away..  More boring travel.  Besides, if it's this Mark guy that comes to meet up with you, it'll pretty much be the same situation.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Finally in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/finally-in-japan">Finally in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 12, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>okey dokey.  i'm bored again waiting for my fukuoka flight..</p><p>well, the Narita airport was certainly not what i was expected.  when i think of the term international airport, i think of the scale of Minneapolis or Chicago, where there are tons of shops within.  Minneapolis is like a Mall.  Narita, on the other hand, basically treats itself as a conduit.  Connecting flights from across the globe and internally within its country as well.  That's it..</p><p>There are little food stands here and there, but they are all privately owned.  There's no 'mcdonalds', and there's no convience store chain.  I mean, overall, i know that Japan specializes far more in 'mom and pop' type organizations as we would see it, but i figured that some of the bigger chains would sink their roots into the airport.</p><p>Unfortunately because of the small scale airport business ventures, i have been unable to find my DS dictionary game thingy.  Oh well..  i'm sure i'll be able to pick it up tomorrow somewhere.<br/>__</p><p>Let's see here..  for those of you coming over here next week and flying through Narita airport, i thought i'd let you in on two big things that i wasn't expecting at all, but really weren't a big deal.</p><p>1) The airport is divided between international flights and domestic flights.  All internation flights arrive and depart from Terminal 1, whereas domestic flights use Terminal 2.  Both terminals are not connected at all, and you will need to take the shutter bus from one Terminal to the other.  This really isn't a big deal, since the shuttle bus drives back and forth between the terminals every 8 minutes.</p><p>2) All checked baggage must pass through customs.  At the beginning of the day, the bording pass guy said that my baggage was checked and would arrive at Fukuoka automatically.  Well, this was not what happened because the Japanese government wants to check everything that comes through the airport.  Therefore, most likely, you'll need to actually pick up your luggage from the Narita airport, go through customs, and then re-check your baggage in on your flight over to Fukuoka.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, i took the first advice i was given and left my baggage back at Terminal 1 after i had already gone to Terminal 2.  So.. I had to go back to the first terminal, get my stuff, and then come back to Terminal 2.  Luckily, the girl who was checking me in for my Fukuoka flight was incredibly nice ^_^.</p><p>3) I suppose one more thing that i didn't know was coming, is a customs form they give you on your long flight to Japan.  You must fill this thing out to give to Immigration in order to receive your passport stamp for your stay in japan..  It takes a minute to fill out.  super easy<br/>___</p><p>Anyways, nothing can really prepare you for how annoying your 12-13 hour flight will be.  It's horrible.  Well, at least with American Airlines' cheapest seat.  I suppose First Class would definately be a step up.  But it's still so damn long, and that's only half of your travel time for that day.  Get yourself a GOOD DS game you can waste countless hours on, and then while you are in airports, find some way to recharge it.</p><p>I don't know what i'm going to do on my way back, but i'm sure as hell going to find that USB DS charger.</p><p>Man... i really can't think of anything that would've made that flight better.  You can't get comfortable at all.  Maybe i should stop buying airfair for as cheap as possible.<br/>___</p><p>Ok...  the Fukuoka airport is MUCH more what i was expected from an international airport.  Huge spaces and plenty of shops ^_^</p><p>My good SPAMM pal, #five (or Nathan), was there waiting for me by the baggage claim, so i was in good hands.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01545.webp" /></p><p>Check out the baggage claim sticker they put on the luggage:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01561.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to On a Jet Plane" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/on-a-jet-plane">On a Jet Plane</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 11, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Oh my god, this flight is so damn boring.  It amazing how you think you're prepared to waste 23 hours playing Nintendo DS, and you can't make it half way through the trip without wishing you brought some other form of entertainment.  I blame that on the games though.  Deep Labyrinth is pretty bad, and Mario Kart isn't the type of game you play for an entire day straight.</p><p>Also, i've seen Nacho Libre twice on the flight already, and i'll probably watch it another 3 times before i land in Tokyo.  Like everything on the plane it has japanese subtitles to go with it, so i've been practicing my Katakana quite a bit.  I keep seeing ã?¬ã?¹ã?©ã?¼ during the movie, and i couldn't figure it out, until it just clicked.. wrestler.</p><p>I'm going to have to kiss that boarding pass attendant guy that i got this morning, as i rolled into Minneapolis airport around 6:30 AM.  He modified my flight path to fly out of Chicago, rather than all the way down to Dallas.  Thus  changed my flight time from 17 hours down to 12 hours.  I haven't even been on this flight long enough to cover that difference, and i'm already going stir crazy.  Ok, that doesn't make sense, Chicago would save me 5 hours?..  Oh.. i added, wrong.  That would've been a 13 hour flight, not 17.</p><p>Japan is ahead 14 hours from the US (15 during daylight savings), so i'm used to always adding 2 and 12 hours to our time to get Japan time.  I keep forgetting i have to do the reverse from overhere.  it hasn't quite clicked yet <_<</p><p>I don't think this flight would be as boring if i could have the window shutter open to watch outside the whole time.  For these long flights, they shut off all the lights and close all the windows, to give people the option to sleep, rather than keep them awake.</p><p>I really wish i would've installed Google Earth on my computer before i left so i could actually identify to mountains and lakes as we fly over there, rather than relying on the flight information solely.</p><p>The onboard flight display is rather informational about our current flight status.  It cycles through a bunch of maps of exactly where we are on Earth, along with Miles remaining, time remaining, time in tokyo, time at home, time underneath us.  In fact, I've got exactly 7 hours left before i land over there.</p><p>Oddly enough, Tokyo, Japan is almost exactly 10,000 km from Chicago.  What a weird little fun-fact that will ultimately prove useless.</p><p>One thing that never really occured to me because i wasn't thinking outside the box, was the curvature of our flight path.  I mean, yes we're flying on a straight path directly to tokyo, and the shortest distancee between those two points, but on a flat map it's a semi-circle.  I wasn't taking into account the curvature of the Earth and the flight path being wrapped around it.  So actually, we haven't even touched the Pacific ocean yet.  Currently, we're above Alaska.  I wonder if i can see that screwed up oil main...  :looks outside: .. holy crap, snowy mountains!</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01537.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01537.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01537.webp" /></p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01541.webp" /><br/>jesus, check out those last mountains.  I bet they were pretty snowy before global warming.</p><p>oh god, my eyes..  i shoulon't go back and forth between the bright vast outdoors and the dim boring indoors so fast.  Oooohhh.. looks like we're almost at Archoridge.  hey wait a second, that looks a hell of alot bigger than it did in the movie Insomnia.  Hmm...  that was archoridge in that movie, wasn't it?</p><p>man, that's so bizzarre..  it's a pretty big city, but it is surrounded by absolutely nothing.  how desolate.</p><p>anyways... now that i've officially decided i don't give a shit .. i'm going to stare out the window for the next several hours.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Yen is weird" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/yen-is-weird">Yen is weird</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Overall my travel is 23 hours :/..  I have a quite flight down to Dallas, and then a 17 hour flight over to Tokyo.  In Tokyo, i have a 4 hours lay over before my 1 1/2 hour flight to Fukuoka.</p><p>During those 4 hours i plan on puchasing this Japanese Dictionary for the DS: <a xhref="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-hw-49-en-70-198v.html" title="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-hw-49-en-70-198v.html">The Rakubiki Jiten</a>, which allows you to draw in Kanji using the Touch Screen, and it'll translate the characters and give you the meaning, the romaji, and the english translated word.  It's rather well know dictionary too, so i figure that it will be rather easy to find at Narita airport in Tokyo when i'm there for 4 hours.</p><p>I need to make sure not to run my DS out of batteries on the way there though.  I should've bought this DS USB power cable, so i could recharge it using my laptop's battery mid-trip.  :shrugs: oh well.</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, i'm outta here.  Later USA.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/study-abroad/4">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
