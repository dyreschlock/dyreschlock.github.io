| October 10, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>well, it didn't take long for my brand new laptop to break.</p><p>So...  yesterday, we were all sitting in teh lab going about our business.  I was watching some cheap ass gamer videos.  I got a whif of something on fire.  It smelt rather familar, like the smoke emitted from a soddering iron.  Brian also smelt this delectable stentch and commented, "say.. do you guys smell smoke?"</p><p>We looked around a little bit, and then i took a look at my keyboard.  "Holy crap, there's smoke coming from my laptop!  wtf!"  I quickly unplugged it and turned it off.  Hmmm....  that's rather odd.</p><p>The truth is, i had smelt this before while i was in a lab, but i didn't think anything of it.  I didn't quite realize it was my laptop that was smoking...</p><p>Later on in the evening, i turned it on to access the damage.  It seemed to work perfectly fine.  Hmmm...  I began writing out all the backlogged blog entries that i haven't gotten to yet.  I actually spent time writing them, so they are't as poorly written as the previous couple of entries you may have read.</p><p>I didn't plug my laptop into the wall though, so the batteries became low on power.  "Well, i suppose i'd better plug it in to regenerate the battery."  I plugged it in and nothing out of the ordinary happened.  I continued typing along and saving every now and then.  30 minutes later, poof.  It just shut off.</p><p>"that's odd..  the system icon said the battery was charging.."  I rebooted, and the computer died again after 10 seconds.  I removed the battery and tried using just the AC power, which didn't work at all.</p><p>My diagnosis is that the AC power port has fried itself, so i can ONLY use battery power and the laptop cannot recharge the battery.</p><p>Hmmm.... come to think of it, my camera batteries haven't been charging here either.  I wrote this one off as unimportant though, since my batteries were quite old and can be easily replaced.  However, now it's quite similar to the same situation i have with my laptop. </p><p>This has really only EVER been a problem at school though.  My laptop has never caught fire anywhere else other than using the power strips at school.  Japan is kinda weird when it comes to power.  You'll never find an outlet with 3 prongs, only 2.  So i had to get a power converter to use these 2 pronged outlets.  Perhaps the dip in power actually kept my laptop from overheating and starting on fire.  The school has these 3 prong power strips, rather than ones that require power converters.</p><p>HMMMMMMMM......   so currently i'm laptop-less.  I sent an email off hp compaq concerning the warrenty and fixing of my laptop, but i'm not really going to be able to send it in for repairs.  I'll have to see what they say about it.  It might be faster to purchase a laptop battery charger, and tough it out until January and then send it in for repairs.</p><p>Unfortunately, HP Compaq have ZERO japanese support, so either way i'm going to have to pay shipping charges overseas.  I do have an external harddrive to store my photos on, so i should be able to continue to take massive amounts of photos.</p><p>____</p><p>Anyways, before my laptop caught fire, i did upload all my pictures from the weekend.  here are the

| October 8, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Oh man.. today was a day like no other.  I don't think i've mentioned that Nagasaki has a penguin aquarium have i?  We had made tentative plans to visit said penguins, but the kunchi festival was in our way a little bit.  Despite kunchi, people still planned on going to the penguin aquarium, so Brian and I planned on doing the same.  We tried to locate those individuals planning on going, but they seemed to have disappeared.  "Screw it..  let's go there anyways.  We're on a mission from god," i motivated Brian.  "hell yeah..  penguins here we come."</p><p>Unlike most tourist attractions in Nagasaki, the penguin is way of the east side.  Pretty much as far east as we are north of the central downtown area.  It takes me about 40 minutes to walk to the Densha, and another 20 minutes from there downtown.  It's faster by bus, but also more expensive.  My masterful navigational, kanji recognition, and common sense skills would be my best tools today as we dared to take a bus somewhere far away.  We rode the Densha as far east as it would go, and then began looking for buses.</p><p>Well lets see....  the bus schedule had one bus that was far more popular than the others.  It had 3 or 4 stops at our location an hour, compared to others which stopped by once every two hours.  I figured this had to be our mark, since the bus system has a real strict sense of direction.  I double checked my map to be sure, and sure enough.  The kanji for the penguin aquarium was the same for a notable bus stop on this route.   huzzah.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" /></p><p>I hadn't ventured this far east yet, so there was alot of beautiful landscape that i hadn't yet capture on film.  Plus it was boring waiting 20 minutes for the bus to arrive at our stop.  To pass the time, i attempted to figure out where all these buses were actually going.  There's some much Nagasaki east, that i really didn't know what was out there, or ever how to get there.</p><p>As soon as the bus came, we were whisked away on the highway of love.  The road connected nagasaki downtown to its East was cut into the side of several mountains, so one side of the bus had a fantastic view down to into the river valley.  We even went by another hydroelectric plant that collected a large amount of mountain from the mountains ahead.  Hydroelectric, Wind and Solar along with some Natural Gas have been Nagasaki's greatest power sources.  I've come across two dams that must generate a massive amount of electricity.</p><p>The bus continued past the dammed lake and into a tunnel within one of the protective mountains.  It was a rather long tunnel, actually.  A minute later we emerged alongside the Nagasaki ByPass that connects Nagasaki to the rest of Kyushu.  The ByPass goes through Isahaya and onto Fukuoka, eventually.  The ByPass was suspended above the valley on a massive bridge.  Both sides of the bridge were tunnels within the neighboring mountains.  Our bus continued along the road the winded alongside both of the mountains and continued onto the city below us.  East Nagasaki was really quite separated from its' parent counter part.  Mountains seem to have that effect.</p><p>The view was extraordinary.  Below us was the city that extended right to the beach of the bay.  From there, the water went on to the horizon and met up with more mountains of japan opposite the bay.  The terrain of japan is so beautiful.. there's really nothing like it in America.  Sure we have mountains, but they aren't sandwiched between sea and ocean, nor is the sea sandwiches between mountain and forest.  The sealine is so jagged, that you'll always see more land after a vast body of water.  If only there was enough time to explore it all.</p><p>The bus descended down the road into the lower city.  Brian noticed several road signs indicated the aquarium ahead, so we got off the bus.  Our fare was 270 yen, i think.  Rather pricey.  We followed signs and came across our destination:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" /></p><p>Penguins lay inside that very structure, i thought to myself.  The aquarium was so kind as to have a vending machine outside to purchase your tickets from.  Vending machines have an inherit flaw though...  They cannot take a Student ID and give you a discount.  Therefore, we went over to information and inquired to it's existance.  For some reason, the penguin aquarium doesn't have a student discount.  What kind of crock is that...  It's a fricken Aquarium.  This building bleeds learning.  Whatever, we paid our $5 entrance fee and hopped inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" /></p><p>Poised in the entrance, was a massive tank of fish used to feed the hungry flightless birds.  The silver fish shimmered in the light and moved about in a very wave-like motion.  It was alot like what you'd see on the discovery channel, but screw that... i'm looking for penguins!</p><p>Opposite the food tank, was the bottom portion of the King penguin tank.  Several penguins would swim down looking for food in the 6 meter deep tank.  Some would play with each other in the form of tag.  Others would just move around for the fun of it.  I think the really up the mercury levels in the fish they feed these penguins because they seemed pretty uncaring of their whole tanked imprisonment.</p><p>Off to the side was more interesting sea creatures.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" /></p><p>There were a ton of weird looking fish from the deeps of the ocean swimming around in a very crowded tank.  The stingray made quick movements though, despite the overpopulation.  There was this HUGE 6 foot long fish though that must've been bored out of his mind.  I mean, this picture was probably taken on a good day.  He should just kill all the other fish for the hell of it.  Then things would get interesting.</p><p>Downstairs was kinda boring so we went upstairs for some actual penguin action.

"now i've one-upped her, since i've also got to pet a penguin, but in japan!".  Brian replied, "no no no, you've got to go a little bit beyond that.  you've got to completely one-up her."  I thought for a moment.. "alright..  how about you distract the attendents, and i'll punch that little penguin over there.  I don't think she'll be able to one-up getting thrown out of a Japanese aquarium."</p><p>Oh hilarious gander..  As we approached the penguin pen, it was almost our time for the petting!  There were two penguins in the pen, and they alternated who got to go to which penguin.  The little kid before us went over to the one of the right.  He was so elated to see such a magnificent creature up close.

It all began around Noon o'clock when Brian and I arrived at the nagasaki station to meet up with the other americans for a fun filled day of kunchi.  Once we met up with everyone, we took off to the Suwa Shrine, exactly where brian and i were last night.  Most everyone took the train, but that was far too good for us.  The gods gave us these fancy walking legs for a reason.  Several people followed us and we made way to the Suwa Shrine.  We took a little short cut, and came across a convience store.</p><p>"This would be the start of a most beautiful day," i thought as we all piled into the convience store and picked up some more Beer.  Whooo hooo, 2 more stickers closer to that TV watch.  We regrouped outside, and continued to the top of the suwa shrine where we met up with everyone.  There was a liquor store right outside the shrine where most of the students bought some provisions.  As Brian, Morgan and I finished up the booze we had purchased 10 minutes prior, we began to ponder..  "hmmmm...   let's access the situation.  the plan is to stand in line for the next 3 hours to get free tickets into this thing and we just finished up our beers..  uh... HOLY CRAP. festival stuff"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" /></p><p>and there they go.  These are the monks of the temple, bringing the money offering chests down from the Suwa Shrine, continuing through the city and arriving at the harbor.  Following them would be the 3 shrines of the gods, brought from the Suwa Shrine to the harbor.  During kunchi, festival it is said that the gods are confused and cannot find their way back to the temple.  Therefore those who are clensed must bring the shrines down to the harbor in an open area for the gods to find their way back to the temple easier..  The shrines will stay at the harbor for two days, and then brought back to the temple.</p><p>I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit, because i have pictures of that...  First off, Morgan, Brian and I figured that we should just stop thinking about running back to the convience store to get booze and just fricken do it.  We broke away from the pack, and got our asses to the convience store.  I pick up another 3 beers, and added the stickers to my card.  Whooo...  now i have 7 or so stickers.  It seems we weren't the only ones that thought alcohol was a great idea at 1pm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" /></p><p>This monk picked up some tall boys, while Morgan and Brian decided to be a bit more creative with their drinking.  The both bought 2 liters of orange juice and some cheap $5 vodka.  I finished off one beer pretty quick, and we dashed back to the top of the Shrine.</p><p>We got inside the open area and began to wait for the clensed souls to carry the 3 portable shrines down from the shrine and on-way to the harbor.  Everyone was quite impressed with the ingenuity of Brian and Morgan, as i finished off my second beer.  "Whoooo... kunchi festival," i said celebrating the day.  "Hey, here comes the shrine guys..  Imma gettin' a closer look."  I stumbled down the steps all the way to the front, to snap a couple of pics:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" /></p><p>Everyone took off after the shrines as they were transported down the long staircase to the streets below.  Now, rather than following the shrines all the way to the harbor, we were to stand in line in the shrine area, itself, to nab ourselves some free tickets for the kunchi show.  After running after the shrines, everyone sort of left me and went to the line, so i had to play a little catch up.  I climbed back into the stands, and went back to where we had entered.  Empty..  ok.  They weren't that far way though, they were just up the street and around the corner in line.  It was pretty easy to find actually.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" /></p><p>Oh yeah, baby.  Nearly front of the line.  We are totally going to get free tickets.  As i got to my place in line, Brian handed me my third beer which i had left where i was sitting earlier.  "Whoo hoo...  let's all get drunk in the hot hot sun," i suggested.  Since we weren't going anywhere, the other students had already caught on this idea.  Alex started working on his 6 pack, and others began working on their beers too.  Wheee..  It just so happens that quite a bit of people were drinking their delicious Asahi, so i was able to fill in some more stickers on my Beer card.   Oh man...  we've hardly seen anything and kunchi festival already kicks ass.</p><p>A whole lot of line sitting..  I took a panoramic to commemorate the day: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04378.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04378.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04378.webp">whee</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" /></p><p>"Alright!  The line is beginning to move..  now the simple task of standing up... I .. uh... whooooaaa...  yeah, i'm good."  In case you're wondering, Beer is a bit more alcoholic in japan.  Even the cheap stuff.  So 5 beers is a pretty good investment for some entertainment.  Especially the big cans, which i had purchased.</p><p>"Yosh!..  now we've got our free tickets and get to sit down on the steps."  ugh...  These are solid stone steps, and they stuffed in as many people as possible.  My ass did not appreciate the rock hard surface that it's soft gluttoness cheeks had to be placed upon.  The event was to begin around 4pm, and we sat down around 3pm.  I took some more panoramic shots as the stands began to fill with more and more people:  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04388.webp">one</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04399.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04399.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04399.webp">two</a>.  Wheee...</p><p>I got Five an extra ticket, so he joined us as soon as he could.  Around 4pm the event began.  I took about 300 pictures of the actual kunchi, but each, in itself, was rather boring.  It was the same view, from the same spot, far away.  You can't see any detail, nor anything really compelling.  So..  instead of maticulously going through the photos to pick out the best ones, i decided, there and then, to combine them all into an Animated gif.  Perhaps 300 bad pictures could produce something rather remarkable.  So here it is:</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04676.webp">Kunchi Festival 2006</a> (11.6 mb)</p><p>This takes place over 3 hours beginning at 4pm.  It consists of all 6 acts of the kunchi festival; however, the first couple are a little nerfed because i got REALLY tired of dragging and positioning all these photos half-way through.  The ending acts are better anyways..</p><p>Each act begins with the kasaboko, an umbrella-like portable shrine in which a single person carries and spins it around.  They do switch out the people, so it's not the same guy.  The quality of this performance is measured by the height of the kasaboko, and amount of spins the person can do.  This part is rather boring since it's just a guy spinning around in circles.  After each performance, the crowd yells out, "motekoi! motekoi!" or...  "one more time! one more time!"  it's an encore, though it's really annoying.  Why would you want to see the same thing get spun around again?  It's boring, get on with something else.</p><p>The first performance was a song and dance routine.  It had geisha...  I don't really remember much else.  Right before this dance routine, several ushers began throwing bandanas in the crowd.  Duuuude.  Bandanas!  We were so high up though, there's no way one of those old guys could get it to me.  Sigh...</p><p>The next neighborhood's routine was a bit more entertaining.  After their kasaboko spun around and got off stage, the neighbor men wheeled out a gigantic ship in which children played music while riding.  The routine seemed to tell the story of a fisherman out at sea catching fish rather successfully.  Each of neighborhoodsmen wore their specially designed kimonos which represented waves in the ocean.  It's rather beautiful if you look close enough.  The movement of the men moving the ship represent waves crashing against it and moving it about the ocean.  After the child caught his fish, it was time for the 'waves' to do there thing... but first, the usher's began throwing bandanas into the crowd again.  This time there was an usher right next to us.  Duuude.  I tried to grab one, but alas, None were thrown to me.</p><p>Anywho... the 'waves' moved around the boat a couple times, then were called back.  Moved the ship around, called back, moved ship, called back, moved ship, and finally left.  Wheee... spinning a ship is so cool.</p><p>The next neighborhood's routine was probably my favorite of the night.  This is the dance of the foreignors.  Once again!  Before the dance began, the ushers began throwing out bandanas.  The first throw went right into Morgan and Five, so they scooped some up rather easily.  I, once again, missed out.  "This is going to take drastic measures," i thought.  "i'm totally going to get a banner before the day is done."</p><p>Anyways, those townspeople dressed as chinese began doing a chinese dance.  It was very syncronized and flowed quite well.  The real amazing part of the show were the two solitary dutchmen.  This is now as the dutchmen clown dance, and was developed while the japanese were fascinated by the westerners weird ways.  They thought they looked like clowns in their weird outfits and crazy customs.  Even though this dance really rips of the dutch, the dutch see it as a sign of admiration and honor.</p><p>The next neighborhood did another song and spin the ship routine.  This time i totally eyeballed the usher on his way down to sit next to us.  I was TOTALLY going to get a bandana this time.  All the townspeople came out and bowed, then performers began singing.  The usher got up and began throwing out bandanas..  "OOOOIIIIII!!!!" i yelled.  "OOOIIII!!!!!" as loud and annoyingly as i could.  Kyle and Five could not help but burst into laughter at my over the top attention getter.  However, it was totally ineffective.  The bastard didn't even throw anything near me.  ugh....</p><p>The neighborhood spun around their ship as the sunset.  "mottekoi!..  mottekoi!"  again and again and again and again...</p><p>The next neighborhood would performance a song and dance rountine that hadn't been performed in the last 41 years.  Come to think of it, the last time it was performed was the last year that an emperor to the thrown had been born.  I was wonder if that's significant...  Anywho, once again, i totally eye-balled the usher coming down the aisle with a new basket full of bandanas.  By now, Five had taken a look at his bandana.  Each bandana had been a specific bandana for the performance about to be given.  Five and Morgan both got the Dutchmen dance bandana.</p><p>Once the townspeople bowed and presented themselves, the bandanas flew..  "OOOOIIIIII!!!!!  DAMMIT! OOOOIIIII!!!!  OVER HERE!".  Five and Kyle cracked up again, but i wasn't laughing.  A spray of bandanas flew past me quite out of grasp.    "FUCK!!...  well whatever.  There's one dance left, and it's the most significant out of them all.  By every fiber in my being, i was get that fucker's attention and cletch victoly..  VICTOLY!!!"  Anyways, i really don't even remember this dance, so i guess there was a reason it hadn't been done in the past 41 years.  Though, that didn't stop the audience from yelling out that lovable phrase, "motekoi! motekoi!"</p><p>Once, they retreated down the steps of Suwa Shrine it was time for the fated hour: the whale dance.  Their kasaboko came out into the open spinning around.  The same kasaboko i had seen early in the week on Tuesday.  It was rather beautiful in the lit up realm of the shrine basen.  There he is...  There's that usher.  My eyes was dead set on the usher to my right.  I paid close attention to his every move, and bid my time for him to rise and begin chucking the bandanas into the audience.</p><p>Once the kasaboko retreated down the steps, the townspeople brought out several transporting boats representing a starving village.  The history of the whale dance is that a starving town would prey to the gods to bring them food.  Everyday they would set up fishing, but would catch nothing.  Enividably, they would put all there resources into hunting down a whale that would feed their villages for the entire winter.  Something like that, anyways...  The little kid yelled out his chant, as the townspeople recanted the phrase with a booming sound.  It was quite powerful.  The song had ended, and the ships began to vacate the arena.  That's right usher, i've got my eye on you.  The first sign of movement, and you know exactly what you're going to hear.  The townspeople bring out the whale to spin around, and usher began his stand.</p><p>"OOoOOOOOOOIiIIiIII!!!!!  DAMMIT!" i screamed as to cletch my hands on a whale bandana.  Come to think of it, my little story here is somewhat similar to the town's story.  All they need is that whale to feed their town and they would be full of riches, though the whale is elusive.  It's difficult to catch and even more difficult to keep.  "OOOOOoOOOOOIIIII!!!  Throw some of those things over heeerreeeeyyaaaa!!!"  An opportunity, a spray of bandana went aloft over our pearched seats.  I saw the fabled bandana drift through the sky across the people and within my grasp..  I extended my arm and.....</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" /></p><p>YOINK!  fuck yeah!  I plucked the spinning shimmering bandana from the sky and closed my hand tight.  Oh yeah baby..  cubs win! cubs win!  Truthfully, i think it was drifting toward a little kid, but screw that.  This was destiny.  The destiny of a very tall guy who could reach over everyone else and grab something floating in the sky.  Such as it is.  Another such bandana went directly to Kyle, sitting right next to me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" /></p><p>I think Ryan got one of these bandanas too.  Anywho, with the tossing of the bandanas complete, it was time to watch the dance of the whale.  The dance was special because our very own history professor, Seb, was the first non-japanese person ever to take part in the kunchi festival.  He married into this neighbor, and since has become a shinning icon of cultural sharing, understanding, and prosperity.  So many others not part of Nagasaki had been pushed away from and shunned from taking part in the festival, but Seb is such a master of the japanese culture..  he is the chosen one.</p><p>But yes, they spun around the whale a couple times.  The whale is also unique, as inside, two men pump water from the whale into the sky.  It's a real eye catcher compared to the ships which don't really have moving parts.  Off to the side, was the whale's boats though with children playing the song of the whale.  Encore, after encore, after encore, after encore, the whale spun itself around and shot water into the sky.</p><p>I was rather impressed by the festival.  I thought it was pretty neat to see such an old tradition continue today was such an awesome amount of support from the entire Nagasaki city.  Once the whale exited, everyone got up and began to leave.  Five, Kyle and I ventured to the shrine area to look around.  The actually shrine area was quite empty without the 3 shrines..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" /></p><p>We had already lost everyone else at this point, so Five recommended we check out this restaurant of his in Hananomachi.  "Sure sounds good.  After a kick ass day of festivals, boozing, bandanas, and rudely yelling my head off, i'm quite hungry."</p><p>In Hananomachi, we came across one of the ships from the kunchi festival that was giving respect to those businesses that had supported it throughout training, niwamise, and everything really..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" /></p><p>"Whoooo...  i'm hungry."  The restaurant Five brought us to was extremely quaint.  It was a very small two story area, with a bar downstairs and seating upstairs.  The speciality of this restaurant is Gyooza, which is alot like a pot-sticker.  We had 6 orders of Gyooza, and 2 orders of this egg stuff, i forgot the name.  The gyooza was pretty tasty, though i don't really think they constitute as a meal.  It kinda reminds me of eating a bag of Doritos for dinner.  The egg stuff was also pretty good, but equally non-filling.  To be fair, it was about 9pm, and i hadn't eaten all day, so nothing of this magnitude would really fill me up.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" /></p><p>I should really buy some eggs and vegetables and make something delicious too.  This restaurant also needed to leave a picture of water at the table so we could actually quench our thirst, rather than build it.  Luckily, we did leave about the same time a whole rush of people entered.</p><p>We stopped off at a convience store to grab some drinks.  I picked up another beer since it's cheaper than anything else, really.  Huzzah!  Sticker #18  I'm halfway to my TV Watch... whee!</p><p>That was pretty much the end to an awesome day of kunchi.  Bandana bitches!  I played a quick game of DDR at taito on the way home to discover that they changed the amount of songs from 3 to 4 for 100 yen.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ura Kunchi" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ura-kunchi">Ura Kunchi</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 6, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>As mentioned earlier, this weekend is the illustrious Kunchi festival: the festival of festivals.  Mark had announced a timeline of events in class and tonight was Ura Kunchi.  A festival of amatuers and other neighborhoods not scheduled to partipate in this year's event, but hold an event of their own for the gods.  This was down at the Suwa Shrine, so brian and i left dance club earlier to go check it out.  We stopped off at mcdonalds on the way down there..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" /></p><p>This is what a japanese mcdonalds looks like by the way.  Pretty much the same as an American mcdonalds, except in japanese and more expensive.</p><p>Anywho, we took the train car downtown and arrived at the Suwa Shrine.  The Suwa Shrine was laced with paper talismen and glowing laterns.  It was rather festive, as the times had called for.  We made our way to the top, but were certainly aware of the inactivity.  Nothing really seemed to be going on at the moment.  In fact, the vendors weren't even selling anything yet.</p><p>We reached the summit of the staircase to an empty showcase where the ura kunchi was supposed to take place.  This had certainly conflicted with our given information.  We began to inquire as to the where abouts of ura kunchi.  We asked a nearby police man why nothing was here.  30 minutes and bad japanese later, we were informed that no such event was taking place at Suwa Shrine.  sigh....</p><p>Well... whatcha gonna do.  Ura kunchi was a bust.  Such a downer requires the consumption of alcohol.  Brian and I hit the local convience store at the bottom of the hill and picked up a couple cans of the cheap, yet delicious Asahi.  We also began filling out our Beer cards too.  Most cans of Asahi have a little sticker placed on the outer aluminum shell.  This little sticker is to be removed, and placed on a Beer card.  Each beer card holds 36 stickers.  A complete Beer card can be sent in for a chance to win 1 of 5000 TV watches!  Duuuude.  Whoever said that drinking beer didn't get you anything, was WRONG!</p><p>Anyways, with our beers in hand and cards stickered, we simply began walking around town since there wasn't anything else to do.  We found a poster for the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04299.webp">Densha Otoko</a> movie.  Unfortunately, all the movies inside this video store were mostly disney or at most PG.  There was no porn, which i was hoping for.  We also came across the kunchi festival grounds near the city hall:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" /></p><p>We continued along the main road and came to Hananomachi.  Walked around a bit looking for anything of interest.  There was a stray cat hanging out near some benches</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" /></p><p>and another one, eating some scraps of food lying around the ground:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" /></p><p>eechh...  That white cat is rather ugly.  Unfortunately, i did not have any sticks nearby to poke it with, or else it would have gotten what for.  Actually, i think what the cat really needs is some food.  I should've ran into the dollar store and gotten some delicious treats that the cat could've feasted upon.  Then it would've been the king of stray cats.  KING!  Actually, it probably would've died from overeating.</p><p>The dollar store did have a rather useful tool though:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" /></p><p>A fake security camera.  With this device you can fool pedestrians into thinking that you are keeping a close watchful eye on the exterior of your home.  Simply screw this plastic camera into an overhang and input 2 AA batteries.  The batteries will light up the red LED light posed on the front of the camera to complete the full effect.  No burgler will dare try to break in with this clearly visible security camera stalking his every move.</p><p>suckers...  it's only 4 whole dollars.  a great investment for what may be potentially stolen..  Can you really put a price on that?</p><p>Let's see here...  the book store had copies of a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04317.webp">Digital Devil Saga</a> novel...  and also a very graphic book on this year's <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04318.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04318.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04318.webp">kunchi festival dances</a>.

Tomorrow is the actual kunchi festival.</p><p>On another note, i got my refund of $1000 from going to the dorms rather than a host family.

The Nagasaki Foreign Language University goes by a rather unorthodox manor of scheduling their classes.  Each day has five hour and a half long periods that start at 9am.  Each 2 credit class i have is only once a week too.  The Language is 6 credits though, so it meets 4 times during the week.  I am taking 4 electives this semesters, and here's my fantastic schedule:<br/><table width="700" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tr><th width="30%"></th><th width="22%">Mon</th><th width="22%">Tue</th><th width="22%">Wed</th><th width="22%">Thu</th><th width="22%">Fri</th></tr><tr><td>9:00am - 10:30am</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Literature</td><td>Japanese 101</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>10:40am - 12:10pm</td><td>Culture</td><td>Japanese 101</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>1:10pm - 2:40pm</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Japanese 101</td><td>Japanese 101</td></tr><tr><td>2:50pm - 4:20pm</td><td>History</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Society</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>4:30pm - 6:00pm</td><td>Dance Club</td><td>Arts I</td><td>Dance Club</td><td>Arts I</td><td>Dance Club</td></tr></table><br/>I also joined dance club, since it seemed like some good exercise and it is run by girls.  Arts I does meet twice a week, but it's only for a month's time.  It actually only counts as 1 credit.  Most of these electives are rather simple.  Culture, History and Society all have the same basic course work.  Chose a topic to research, write a 8-10 paper, and give a presentation.  Literature is a little different, though.  we just read books in that class.<p>Arts I consists of doing various japanese skills, such as Kimono, Caliography, Tea Ceremony, and something else.

| October 3, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Nagasaki is pretty much the party town of Japan.  During the persecution of Christianity across Japan, the city had money coming in from two directions.  Nagasaki was still making quite a bit of money from the Chinese, since they were the premiere Trading city of Japan.  Nagasaki also got quite a bit of money from the Japanese Government, to simply NOT be christian and go about your daily life being Japanese.</p><p>So many shogun and lords became so rich, that they didn't know what to do with the money.  They began having festivals all the time to spend their money on, and the tradition continues to this day.</p><p>This weekend is the Kunchi festival, which is basically the festivel of festivals.  For the festival, certain neighborhoods across Nagasaki, before a song and dance act to display at the Kunchi festival.  Last night was Niwamise, the showcase of the neighborhoods costumes and equipment for their performance this coming weekend.

This helped pass the time.</p><p>When we finally reached home, and i went straight to bed.  Drinking and Walking is quite tiring.  Kunchi is going to freakin' rock.  Prepare your beers.</p><p>By the way... i think the best beer i've found here is this little 12 oz can of Asahi for 125 yen a can.  It's pretty delicious and it's cheap.  That's the best combo one can hope for.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dance Club" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dance-club">Dance Club</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Good luck spending it here."<br/>____</p><p>Anyways, the other day some girls were going around trying to get people to sign up for Dance club.  On friday, they held their first meeting in a class room and showed up two dances: One for boys and one for girls.  The boy's dance is called Soran.  It's the dance of the fisherman.  I told people that if they signed up for it, i'd do the same.</p><p>Practice has a rather intensive schedule though.  Every Mon, Wed, and Fri at 4:30pm to 6:00pm we must practice for the upcoming festivel in November.  Yeeshh..  that doesn't give me a whole lot of time to do anything else.</p><p>So, Monday rolled around.  Kyle and I went to the destined practicing place in front of the gym.  Around 4:45pm, the girl's showed up to start the practice.  We did stretches and they began to show how to do the Soran dance.  It's actually rather easy.  Just a few simple dance moves, combine, and you're got the beginning of the Soran dance.</p><p>So..  it was the 4 japanese girls leading us, 5 or 6 chinese girls learning the dance, then there's Kyle, myself, Morgan and Kevin learning the dance as well.  Right in front of the gym.. in front of everyone waiting for the bus. ^_^</p><p>We eventually took a break after an hour and began talking about things.  The same questions are always asked.  "Where are you from?", "What's your major?", "How old are you..?"  I said how old i was and they asked if i were married <_<</p><p>We asked them if they were any good at DDR.  Ya know..  chances are they've probably played it before.  Natsuko said she was pretty good at it..  oh really?  So we asked them to go to Taito with us after dance practice to challenge them.  muahaha.</p><p>We stopped off at McDonalds first because people were hungry, and the 1st floor of Taito is a McDonalds.  I finally had my chance to order the infamous Shrimp burger.  I'm not really sure if the shrimp burger actually exists.  I ordered what i thought was the shrimp burger, but it was actually a Shrimp Filet sandwich, much like a Fish Filet sandwich.  It was rather tasty, but definately not a burger.  Man... I could really go for a burger.</p><p>Anywho..  after eating good 'ol american food, we went upstairs to catch out the 'ol DDR machine.  Kyle and I got up on the machine and blew them away ^_^.  Those girls were laughing and cheering.  Wheee..  Unfortunately, Natsuko didn't play because she was wearing jeans, or something like that.  Maki and Miyu played though..  on Basic.  Morgan and Kevin gave it a go too.  Kevin was actually pretty good. ^_^</p><p>There was this nerdy japanese guy hanging around, trying to capitalize on our cheer squad.  He got up on the machine and played some Des-Row songs.  He started on basic, but then failed he second song on difficult.  Poor little fella.  He reminds me of Densha Otoko.</p><p>Anyways, the night was quite fun ^_^.  Dance club should be a blast.  They invited us for sushi and drinking this weekend too. ^_^</p><p>At the end of the evening, i had a picture taken to comemorate the occasion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" /></p><p>DDR can build up quite a sweat.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japanese Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japanese-gaming">Japanese Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 2, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Since coming to Japan i've purchased a couple games; most of which, i cannot play because i didn't bring that equipment with me.  So far i've purchased..</p><p>XII Stag on Playstation 2 for $5<br/>DDR Extra Mix on Playstation for $18<br/>Rez on Dreamcast for $15<br/>Dragonforce on Saturn for $2<br/>Shining Wisdom on Saturn for $2 (I'm not really sure why anymore...)<br/>Some Kanji game on DS for $35 (oops..)<br/>Rakubiki Jiten on DS for $42<br/>Pokemon Diamond on DS for $42<br/>Chososhu Mecha MG on DS for $18 (after points)</p><p>and probably around $30 on DDR Supernova in the arcade, including the e-Amusement Card.  That kanji game was really the only screw up so far.  I might try to trade it in when i pick up Phoenix Wright II at the end of the month.  I've written a little bit of a review for the Rakubiki Jiten, so here are my thoughts on Pokemon Diamond and Chososhu Mecha MG.<br/>____</p><p>Pokemon Diamond.</p><p>Last Thursday, Pokemon Diamond was released to Japan and sold out sometime on Friday.  When we were walking around on Saturday, a copy of Pokemon Diamond or Pearl was no where in sight.  It's still as popular as it ever was. ^_^  Japan should gets it's second wave of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl this coming Friday, so little kids who missed their chance this past weekend will get another chance to pick it up.</p><p>The language barrier is rather amazing.  Since it's marketed for little kids, Pokemon is all in either hiragana or katakana.  There is no Kanji whatsoever, unless you count the yen kanji.  It's helps me build my reading ability of hiragana and katakana rather well ^_^, though i still don't have the vocabulary to know what's going on.</p><p>Pokemon Diamond plays just like any other Pokemon though, so finding out where to go and what to do is simply a matter of talking to everyone in the town and then venturing forth to places you haven't been yet.  I suppose later on in the game, this will become more of a problem.  Currently though, i've been able to get two badges and defeat Team Rocket twice without getting lost or frustrated because of the language..  It's not like Pokemon has much of a story anyways.  I can read about the new cool Pokemon online somewhere if i want the story.</p><p>Back to the yen, i always wondered what the currency actually was in the game.  When playing Pokemon Emerald, everything was in credits.  100 credits for a Poke-ball, 200 credits for a healing item.  I tried to figure out how much that would be in real-life currency.  Actually, i think about this quite often.  "How much would a Final Fantasy tent cost in real life.."  I mean, you make, like, thousands of dollars in the game.  It's not like the idea of going around killing monsters for a living hasn't crossed my mind before.  Anyways, it's 100 yen for a Pokeball.  That's $1.  What a fricken deal.  I'd buy tons of those, if there was a Poke-mart nearby.  Usually when you beat up some kid in the forest, you win $1 or $2 from him.  That's pretty mean.  It's like stealing milk money from children.  I liked my idea before where 1 poke-credit equalled 1/10 of $1.  Then a pokeball is $10 and a little bit more reasonable considering the amount of technology built in them.</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>The graphical style of Pokemon Diamond is quite impressive.  They have effectively transferred the 2D graphics into a 3D plane without screwing over any of the individual detail you'd find in previous titles.  The 3D plane is evident when you walk around and the foreground actually shifts along with your point of view.  It's a very subtle 3D effect that really looks amazing on the DS.</p><p>In battles the graphical style is alot like Pokemon Emerald, with a little bit more of a watercolor backdrop.  The pokemon still have little animations when they enter, ala Emerald.  This is where the touch screen is actually used.  All the battle commands are presented on the touch screen.  It's like Phoenix Wright, where you can either use the the directional pad and select options, or you can just touch the options to select them.  It's pretty slick.  I can still play pokemon one-handed!!  Whoo hoo...  guess who's driving while playing Pokemon when he returns to the states.</p><p>While walking around, you get a little pokemon gadget that keeps tracks on various data on your second screen.  It can keep track of your steps, the current time, your pokemon HP, and.. on other thing.  It's really helpful to have that info up front, especially the steps if you're trying to hatch eggs.</p><p>Speaking of time, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl use a real-time system, much like Animal Crossing.  When it's night outside, it's night in the game.  When it's day outside, it's day in the game.  My game is a little messed up since my DS is on US time, and i don't really want to change it.</p><p>One thing that i've also liked about Pokemon Diamond is the Pokemon themselves..  They aren't stupid looking, or ugly.  Most of them are ligitimitly cute.  I mean, when you began you have a choice between a leafy turtle, a cute little chilly penguin, or a cute little fire monkey. Awww..  I chose the Chilly Penguin ^_^. The first couple pokemon you face are actually pretty cute too.  There's a cute little bird and a beaver.  I picked up a cute little kitty mouse looking thing near the beginning of the game, which has turned out to be pretty slick too.  I've also been leveling up this Pikachu ripoff.</p><p>So anyways, i've played for about 9 1/2 hours and have beaten two gyms.  I found about 49 pokemon and captured about 29 of 'em.  Well on my way to the new pokemon total of around 500 or something.  I probably won't pick up Diamond or Pearl when they are released in the states, but i'll pick up the remake that combines the two.  Unless, i end up running out of things to play when it comes out.  :shrugs:</p><p>So yeah...  Pokemon Diamond is pretty damn slick, i must say.  It's a great pickup for the DS.<br/>_____</p><p>Chososhu Mecha MG</p><p>I found this game used over at Yamada on Saturday for rather cheap.  $32 is rather cheap for games in Japan.  Plus i had $13 something of store credit there, so i ended up getting it for $19.  Wheee..  that's rather cheap for US standards.</p><p>Mecha MG is basically a mecha game, but it has a rather unique control scheme.  You use the D-pad to move around your mech on the playing field, and then you utilize the touch screen to operate the mech..  Each mech has its own custom console, so you have plenty of different modes and attacks.</p><p>The first mission, you are given a regular 'ol mech that can pick up rocks and move them around.  In the middle of the mission, an enemy mech shows up and you must do away with it.  The console had two controls: a horizontal torso pivot and a vertical pivot.  However, there was a pretty big white-space on the side.  I accidently tapped the empty space, and it began to crack.  So i tapped it alot and it broke away to reveal a button to fire off missiles!  Oh yeah.. ^_^  I tore the hell out of that enemy mecha.</p><p>After the first level, you can move about the world.  It's a pretty linear map and you move about unlocking story points and uncovering missions.  Each mission has 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Superhard, which have an obvious difference.  Defeating a mission will give you some money depending on the difficulty you defeat.  Money can be exchanged for goods and services.</p><p>Though, each level so far has given me a mech to use.  I don't actually own a mech to custom myself..  perhaps i'll get one soon.</p><p>Overall i haven't played it too much, but there is plenty game left.  Since i bought it used, there was some completed data on it at around 38 hours.  I played for about an hour to check it out before getting back to Pokemon.  So far, the game is quite slick is well worth a pickup.  If it doesn't reach the states, i suggest you import it if you can find it for cheap ^_^.<br/>_____</p><p>DDR SuperNova Arcade</p><p>So far during my stay i've spent a bit of cash playing DDR Supernova.  Konami has a card that you can purchase deemed the e-Amusement Card and all the recent Konami arcade games i've come across have used it.  It will save your scores, achievements, and other various data for the games you play.  I've only used it on DDR Supernova, but it can be used on Guitar Freaks V3, Drum Mania V3, Pop 'n Music Fever, this Martian Attack game, and so forth.  For DDR Supernova it will save your scores and rankings for applicable Non-stop mixes.</p><p>Supernova boasts nearly 300 songs that are new and old.  It has about 1/3 new songs for the arcade, and 2/3 revival songs from previous arcade mixes.  Of the 1/3 new songs, 1/3 of those are songs that are new to the arcade, but have been featured in console mixes before.  There's about 70 NEW songs featured in the arcade box.  I'm really interested to see how this compares to the US release of Supernova last week.  I'm really loving Xepher, the Seduction remix, AA, the new Des-Row songs, and the new Max 300 mix.  Otherwise i've been playing Quickening and Tsugaru Apple mix a bit, along with the occasional Paranoia Survivor.  Max 300, Maxx Unlimited, and Legend of Max are included, along with Paranoia Respect ^_^.  No Max Period though.</p><p>Overall, DDR Supernova is pretty slick, but it's missing a couple old songs that i would have liked to see.  I'm really sad that Rhythm & Police is not included, but oh well...  can't have everything.  The Non-stop mixes have been rather uninspired as well..</p><p>It's always fun to go into the arcade and dance up a storm to see the reaction of the japanese nerds playing their Dynasty Warriors game.  I've seen a few people who are pretty good at DDR, but overall, no one has really stepped up to kick my ass other than Kyle.<br/>_____</p><p>So yeah...  these 3 games, along with the Rakubiki Jiten have been my primary games at the moment.  I stopped playing Mario Kart after i defeated the Mirror cc class.  I'll probably get back into that later after i finish up Pokemon.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div
