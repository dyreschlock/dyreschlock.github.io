| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My friends and I just finished the most recent season of Dexter, season 6, last night and was a lot better than any of us expected.  After the lack of direction nor interesting characters in Season 5, we were mostly turned off from the series.  But we picked it up, watched it, and glad we did. :)</p><div class='title'><b><em>Spoilers!</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Season Arcs</b></div><p>I think the reason Season 6 pretty well is that we have an actual fleshed out character as a villain with clear motivation, and actually does plenty of murder throughout the Season.  Seasons 1 and 4 did this perfectly and stand as the best two seasons of the show.  Seasons 2, 3, and 5 strayed away from this and fall very flat as a consequence.</p><p>I think that Season 2 had a pretty tight focus, but the villain was basically Dexter.  Unless you count Lyla, but she wasn't a serial killer at all.  She's just a crazy bitch, which was more of a manifestation of Dexter's dark side.  I think that the suspense of Dexter being caught makes up for the lack of a strong villain, but there still isn't a whole lot of murder going on.</p><p>Season 3 is the absolute worse.  We do have a serial murderer, but he has no character at all.  They never wrote him that way.  He's just a dude who skins people.  Who is he?  I dunno.  Jimmy Smitts as the Season's actual villain, but he's not really a serial killer.  He's just a controlling asshole, and the whole season focuses on that.  Who cares?  Get to the killing.</p><p>Season 4 felt incredibly fresh after the horror of Season 3.  Dexter is out killing again, and his kills actually show his character, and he grows.  I wrote about all that while the season first aired: <a href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4" title="/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">October 20th, 2009</a>.  But we have a clear villain, who does a lot of murder.  Dexter learns from the clues and tracks him down, while the police are closing in as well.  And there's an epic showdown.</p><p>With the story they had laid out for Season 5, I think it was doomed for failure.  They had to deal with the aftermath of Season 4, while still spinning their own plot.  Well, they couldn't just focus on grief the entire season, so they needed to throw a villain in their, too, somehow.  And maybe a love plot, too?  Whatever...  This season focused more on Season 4, rather than itself, and suffered because of it.</p><p>With Season 6, they were able to start fresh.  A brand new villain, with a clear motive, and their story focused on throughout the season.  It was fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>I think they learned from Season 4 a little too much.  If you end with a massive cliffhanger, you instantly pull in the audience and make them care far more than the normally would.  I'm guessing that Season 5 Episode 1 had the highest amount of ratings of any single Dexter episode thanks to the ending of Season 4.  And I expect Season 7 Episode 1 to pull in some serious ratings as well.</p><p>Currently, Dexter is signed on through Season 8.  I expect them to actually finish off the show at Season 8, but who knows what'll happen.</p><p>Also, I expect Season 7 to be somewhat similar to Season 5, but perhaps with a Season 2 edge.  It won't be as sappy, or mistake ridden as Season 5 because Dexter isn't some vulnerable lost sheep.  But the writers still have to deal with the aftermath.  In Season 5, they wrote out almost everything that had to do with Rita, Aster, and Cody, and just moved forward.</p><p>I don't think they can ignore Deb, but I wouldn't put it past them to write her as understanding and accepting.  Which is the complete opposite of what she would actually do.  They have a chance to actually end on a high note, and write an interesting drama filled plot between these two characters, but I fully expect them to fuck it up.</p><p>Who knows...  In any case, I'm fully invested in this show again thanks to Season 6. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Finale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-finale">Dexter Season 4 Finale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This season has been fantastic.  Normally, once Premium Channel TV shows (HBO, Showtime) start to become stale, they don't return.  Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, and other great shows start off incredibly strong.  But after Season 2 of Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood after Season 1, they completely fall to ruin.  They either forget what made them a success or can't figure out how to hold on to it.</p><p>Once I finished watching Dexter Season 3, I thought, "This is it.  Dexter is over."  Season 3 went in random directions at times, and ignored the success of Seasons 1 and 2.  Dexter didn't kill anyone for himself.  He didn't learn anything (other than the overall lesson of the season).  It had no personality, in my opinion.</p><p>Season 4 broke this stale curse.  It wasn't some dull misdirected meaningless story.  It's own self-contained story of the Trinity killer was interesting enough.  He was the first truly horrific serial killer.  Dexter saw him as a mentor, and a friend, but Trinity's demons could not be contained.  The writers weaved him into the Dexter mythos and with it brought more than just a lesson learned.</p><div class='title'><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></div><p>Now with Rita murdered as a Trinity victim, and Deb confronting Dexter about Brian Moser, I think Dexter has run out of excuses.  It annoys me how everyone just believes Dexter when he makes up these flimsy excuses, and no one thinks anything else of it.  I guess this is what happens when you kill off Doukes, the only person to actually question Dexter about what he's doing.  </p><p>Thank god Deb has started assuming this role and actually asked Dexter about his peculiar appearance at the raid on Arthur Mitchel's house.  I hope her role in Season 5 eventually leads to realization.</p><p>With Dexter only renewed through Season 5, currently, I wonder if the writers will end Dexter.  Business-wise it would be a stupid move.  The Season 4 Finale is the most watched episode of any Showtime original series with 2.6 million viewers.  But Story-wise, it would make Dexter incredibly tight.  It would never reach the point of being stale.</p><p>When Deb actually verifies the demon inside of Dexter, where would the show go from there anyways?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Season 4 of Dexter has been pretty decent so far.  It doesn't have the same allure and mystery of the first season, but definitely allows the characters to show some rich emotions.  There's plenty of suspense too.  But there have been a few things in these past 2 episodes that have really shown that Dexter, as a show, is back on its game.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b></em></p><div class='title'><b>The emotionless nature of a killer</b></div><p>In the beginning of episode 3, the Trinity killer works away on his second victim.  He brings her to the top of a warehouse and forces her to jump off by her own will.  Getting her to the warehouse and bringing her to the top is pretty easy, but now he has to threaten her to kill herself.  He does so by threatening her family.  With her children in danger, she lets go of the railing and falls to her death.</p><p>Near the end of the episode, Dexter is hunting down the neighborhood vandal.  He discovers who it is, and confronts him in his garage.  Exposing the vandal's identity isn't enough for the vandal to stop ruining the neighborhood.  Dexter roughs him up a little bit, but the vandal refuses.  He has nothing to lose.  Dexter threatens the vandal's family, and the vandal changes his mind pretty quickly.</p><p>I find it interesting how both Trinity and Dexter arrive to the same persuasive tactics, when all other options have been exhausted.  Being killers, they have no emotional connection to their victim, their victim's lives, or life in general.  They will stop at nothing to get their way, and will perform any action to get it.</p><p>Though, it doesn't really sound like much, but it was a parallel occurrence in this episode that linked Trinity and Dexter.  Dexter (the show) attempts to profile what it is to be a killer.  Every killer doesn't follow the same code, but perhaps a killer's code has a general set of guidelines?</p><div class='title'><b>Solving problems</b></div><p>Dexter's "dark passenger" brings him to interesting places and follows convenient leads.  Though, many of those leads in the first two seasons were very convenient for story.  In Season 1, Dexter stalked and killed a couple who were exploiting illegal Cuban immigrants.  After capturing and subduing the couple, he actually talked with them a little bit about relationships and how to "make it work."</p><p>Dexter was having trouble figuring out how to act as a boyfriend to Rita and didn't have anyone to talk to.  The only people he really can talk to are his victims, those who see Dexter for who he really is.  Dexter has no trouble talking to them about this problems, because he's comfortable.  He knows this conversation and "friendship" has a very soon expiration date.  This happens a couple other times, especially when confronts the man who killed his mother.</p><p>In episode 4 of Season 4, Dexter (the show) returns to this problem solving technique when Dexter (the character) stalks and captures a woman who murdered her own family.  A woman who couldn't take the annoying, badgering, constant time loss of the daily grind of family life, so she "solved" it in a way most convenient for her.</p><p>Dexter has been fighting many of the same problems with married life, and "talks" about them with his victim.  Through their dialogue, he grows.  He finds out in himself that he really loves his family and that he would do anything to keep them from harm.</p><p>The release of his dark passenger always gives him clarity.  Room enough to think his way through his social problems.  Yes, killing does get in the way of his family life, but it's essential for his character growth, and for the show as well.</p><p>I don't remember this happening in Season 3 at all.</p><div class='title'><b>8 episodes remain</b></div><p>Season 4 is certainly returning to what made Dexter great.  I still think they're throwing too much suspense into the mix to distract away from the many many plot lines that no one cares about.  But Dexter and Trinity are the stars of this Season and are going strong.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4">Dexter Season 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Like Seasons 2 and 3, the first episode of the new Season of Dexter was leaked to the Internet just a few weeks before its premiere.  It's almost like it's intentional.  It definitely seemed intentional with Seasons 2 and 3.  The quality of the DivX file was superb.  The file I have of Season 4 episode 1 is pretty crappy, so I don't think it was intentional this time.  But who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Where we've been</b></div><p>Dexter is a pretty great show.  Season 1 was an amazing introduction to Dexter.  It displayed Dexter's thoughts and reasoning.  The emergence of a rival serial killer offered mystery, and eventually unraveled into a mirror of himself, his past, and his future.</p><p>Season 2 lost the mystery, but masked it with constant suspense.  Season 2 builds on all the character development from the previous season and demonstrates how well rounded the characters and cast are.  Unfortunately, it is a shallow experience compared to the first Season.</p><p>The typecast, thin representation of the Dexter cast really shows its colors in Season 3.  Season 3 settles down the suspense and mystery and adds character plot after character plot.  Dexter starts to lose spotlight, and Debra, Angel, and Laguerta become essential characters.  I think the writers and producers have become to comfortable with their jobs after Dexter was renewed up through Season 5 given the success of Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>The acting and writing has become very much like a sitcom.  Each actor has their character and always operates in these roles.  The only person that brings any personality to their character is Michael C. Hall with Dexter, which is ironic as he plays an emotionally distanced character.  It's gotten so transparent that it's difficult to watch.</p><p>I'd stop watching the show if I wasn't so invested in these characters.  Plus, I hold hope that Dexter will eventually recapture what made Season 1 so fantastic.  But I think they've completely run Dexter's character dry for story.  Maybe that's why the other characters have become so prevalent.</p><p>Season 3 is a stain in this series and takes it further away from what made it great.  Though, after watching the first episode of Season 4 that gleaming shimmer of hope flickers in my eye.</p><div class='title'><b>New Beginnings</b></div><p>Once the news broke that <b>John Lithgow</b> was the villian in Season 4, I was immediately excited.  Finally, a REAL actor in this dying show.  Michael C. Hall is a pretty good actor, but his range is not nearly as vast as Lithgow.  I was excited to see what they had in store.  Plus, there hasn't been a serial killer villain worth his weight since Season 1.</p><p>Rudy (or whomever) was the perfect villain for Season 1.  But Season 2 and 3?  Technically both seasons had its share of minor villains that Dexter had to vex in order to come out on top.  The story was spread and became weak as a result.  Aside from John Lithgow, Season 4's focus of a single villain should make the story much tighter.</p><div class='title'><b>Or is it..?</b></div><p>Unfortunately, with all these characters and stories of their own, I feel that the serial killing aspect of the show will become less and less important.  The writers seem to care more about the supporting cast and Dexter's home life than what the show was about to begin with.</p><p>Dexter always killed people as an outward expression of dealing with his problems.  It helped him work shit out.  But now, it just seems like he would be better off if he didn't.  His problems are the result of his serial killing.  So give it up!  Dexter already proved that this is not an addiction, so why is he still killing if it's screwing things up?</p><div class='title'><b>Ramble Ramble</b></div><p>Even though I'm pretty negative about the show, I'm still optimistic that Season 4 will turn out alright.  I don't see how it could be worse than Season 3, but the writers have a knack for throwing ridiculous plot points into the mix (SPOILER: such as the end of this first episode), so who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Dexter Season 4 begins this weekend on Showtime!</b></div><p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-2">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's quite incredible. The suspense is perfectly controlled leading to the finale. It builds from the little bits of plot and story peppered in the beginning and gradually mounting an explosion in the end.</p><p>Season 2 really doesn't quite compare. Though, it tries to do the same thing. And has a pretty decent starting point with the aftermath of Season 1. It does a great job of building off the previous season and builds a story of its own, which also leads to a great ending. Unfortunately, the main focus is split.</p><p>Season 1 has a very clear focal point that everything centers on. There are 2 main plots that eventually weave together into one. Season 2 has a focal point, but there is too much plot. And just a little bit of story.

Hall of Six Feet Under fame, is a serial killer.  His victims happen to be other serial killer and murderers.  This is the way he balances out his serial killer need for bloodshed while performing acts of good.  A vigilante at night, but a forensics officer during the day, solving crimes and misdeeds of bloodshed and foreplay.  One job helps facilitate the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 1</b></div><p>However, Dexter's word is turned upside down with the emergence of a true rival.  A serial killer with true value of cleanliness, precision, and love towards his killing methods.  This killer leaves hints for Dexter.  Plays with Dexter.  Looks for a friend in Dexter.  and Dexter finds a playmate in him.</p><p>Dexter is a wonderfully crafted, suspenseful show that will leave you wanting more and more.  I was first recommended to watch this show when I returned from Japan and visited Platteville for the first time.  Matt, Dave, Jamie and Tony were all in agreement that I needed to see this..  but I was busy dealing with the depression of being back in the states.  Luckily, when I visited Justin in North Carolina he was of the same opinion, sat me down with Showtime on Demand, and let me be.</p><p>Season 1 just came out today on DVD, and I definitely recommend this show to those who haven't seen it.  Unlike those arrogantly priced HBO series, Showtime has priced Dexter Season 1 at $40 MSRP..  but you can pick it up all 12 episodes of season 1 for $30 at Best Buy this week.</p><div class='title'><b>Showtime v. HBO</b></div><p>Showtime is really pushing the public towards this show, it seems.  Now that HBO is basically dead, and half a million subscribers canceled their service because Sopranos is now done, Showtime sees this as its chance to pull in as many of that audience as possible.  Dexter is a strong strong show.</p><p>Hell, we almost switched over to Showtime from HBO because of the Sopranos and Dexter, but ended up just quitting HBO.  Sorry, but John from Cincinnati is ass.</p><p>These real high profile pay-channel TV programs really start off strong, for the most part.  Sopranos Season 1 and 2 were amazing, but then began to wither in Season 3.  Six Feet Under Seasons 1 and 2 were equally amazing, but again.. lost all steam in Season 3.  Deadwood didn't keep it's amazing quality past Season 1.  Season 2 killed it.  And Now John from Cincinnati can't even start up strong.</p><p>Season 1 of Dexter was quit well done, despite a couple stereotypical drama-like plot devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 2</b></div><p>Episodes 1 and 2 of Dexter Season 2 have been "leaked" on the Internet.  I just finished watching them and this show really raised the bar.  I can't wait for episode 3...  which'll be in the second week of October :/</p><p>I use the term "leaked" loosely because if I were Showtime, I would send out the first episode or two to generate even more buzz on the show.  I mean, I want to see Season 2 now more than ever thanks to that 2 hour teaser.  It makes decent sense.</p><p>The first two episodes work very well with each other and tie up most of the stuff brought up in this episodes.</p><div class='title'><b>Anywho..</b></div><p>Definitely great stuff..  But, Rent or Netflix Dexter Season 1 today.  ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
