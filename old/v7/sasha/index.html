| July 12, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Saturday was pretty fun, I was really looking forward to today, Sunday.  Today we have Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, Eric Prydz, and Sasha.  Guy Gerber has been solidifying his name among the best in the business over the last couple of years.  Eric Prydz has been HUGE in all the circles of electronic music.  And Sasha is a living legend.  Sasha's involvement guaranteed my sale from the first day tickets went on sale.</p><p>Five and I woke up from our long day of music, and finally left the house around Noon Thirty, I think.  The skies were pretty clear, but there were some bizarre storm warnings that came across the morning news and the weather reports.  One report announced a Severe Thunderstorm warning from 12:45 to 1:30, which we thought was odd.  The radar had absolutely no storm activity in the Chicago area.</p><p>We were directly West of downtown a couple of miles, so our plan was to drive down Lake St., then north up Michigan Ave, to Lake Shore Dr., and then get to the beach.  During the 20 minutes it took us to drive 4 miles to Michigan Ave, the sky turned completely dark.  Huge black clouds surrounding down Chicago.  And winds blew around all kinds of trash and debris.  People walking around on the streets quickly went inside of building to shield themselves for the horror that was about to dump in the downtown area.</p><p>Five and I turned onto Michigan Ave, and got onto Lake Shore Dr. pretty quickly.  Over Lake Michigan there were clear blue skies, but looking West was the direct opposite.  Five continued to drive north, and the clouds emptied on to the city.  We seemed to escape it, though, as only a couple of drops hit our car.  We passed a couple of downed trees by the beach, where everyone was evacuating.</p><p>We reached Montrose beach, which is about 6 miles north of downtown.  All of the storm clouds really stayed directly over Chicago.  There were gray clouds above where we were, but the really dark horrific ones were south.  It was very bizarre.</p><p>Rather than head out to the beach in the middle of a storm, Five and I walked to a nearby restaurant to meet up with our pal, Brian, to wait out the storm.  40 minutes later, we exited the restaurant.  The skies were a little gray, but the storm definitely passed.  By the time, we actually got to the opening gate for Wavefront, you couldn't even tell that a storm was there.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp"  /></p><p>Well, except for the line of people waiting to get in.  Wavefront shut down, and evacuated everyone for 2 hours for fear of storm damage.  A fire department helicopter was circling the beach, and accessing the current weather before Wavefront could proceed with its event.  We were in line only a little while before the Fire department gave the go ahead, and people were admitted entrance.</p><p>Five, Brian, and I made it in around the same time we got in on Saturday, about 3pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp"  /></p><p>I went straight over to the North Stage to see who was on deck.  <b>Danny Daze</b> was spinning a fantastic groovy House set to welcome the crowd back into the festival.</p><p>By the way, along the sides of each stage were a bunch of VIP cabanas.  The North Stage had 3 big ones, and 4 smaller ones.  Each of those Large cabanas cost $10000 to rent for the weekend.  They included plenty of accommodations on top of the prime real estate, but yikes...  I think I'd rather buy a car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>We wandered around a little bit though, and found ourselves over at the South Stage, where <b>Betatraxx</b> was spinning a rather hilarious set.</p><p>The tracks he played was a perfect example of why a lot of people don't take dubstep seriously.  He played a dubstep remix of the <b>Requiem for a Dream</b> epic ending song.  He followed it up with a dubstep remix of the <b>Epic Fight Music</b>.  And then went into a dubstep remix of <b>NES Punch Out</b>.  After which he threw in some classical music, and other dubstep remixes of random well known songs.  It's a prime example of pandering to the crowd for cheap cheers rather than actually building an incredible vibe that stands on its own.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp"  /></p><p>We were really just waiting around for <b>Nadia Ali</b> and <b>Chris Lake</b> to show up.

I guess they were delayed because of the freak weather earlier.</p><p>A local DJ took the stage not too long after 4:30.

Their set rolled perfectly into <b>Guy Gerber</b> who continued with the beautiful vibe.  He didn't tear down the vibe, or try to change it.  He built on the sound Benoit &amp; Sergio started and subtly crept in his own sound.  Seamless.</p><p>And what Guy Gerber started, <b>Steve Lawler</b> built upon.  He absolutely set me on fire.  I don't know why I had a negative opinion of him before, but his set was the perfect build up.  Everything started with Benoit &amp; Sergio into Guy Gerber into Steve Lawler, and just kept building and building, hour after hour.  I was so lost in the atmosphere that I could not care one bit that <b>Eric Prydz</b> was on the South Stage.  I could not pull myself away from Steve Lawler.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp"  /></p><p>And as the clock hit 8:30pm, the stage rotated around for <b>Sasha</b>, and much like the DJs before him, he continued to build.  He piled on that raw classic sound with the fresh chill sounds of summer.</p><p>I think trying to describe the sound of his set is a bit futile.  I mentioned in a <a href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago" title="/sasha-spybar-chicago">previous post</a> that aside from his darker raw progressive house sound, he has a more Tech House / Indie House kind of sound that he's been spinning at his 'Never say Never' events at Ushuaia Beach Resort in Ibiza.  But at this point his Tech House / Indie House vibe has completely taken over, but with his signature style underneath.</p><p>Over the last year, he's been in the studio producing some of his own music.  He's released a few tracks on his Last Night of Earth record label, as well as working on the third installment of his Involver CD series, which he's been somewhat secretive about.</p><p>He started 'Never say Never' because he felt he wasn't playing tracks from all the artists he loved, and, now, 3 years later, he's made that sound his own.  He's separated himself from the other Progressive House kings, and puts himself alongside Guy Gerber, Benoit &amp; Sergio, and all the other DJs that spin a more Tech House vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp"  /></p><p>His set from Wavefront was the perfect soundtrack to a warm summer day.  It started off with the sun up high, and as the music continued to wash over me and the rest of the crowd, the sun slowly descended into the west.</p><p>I'm not never good at trainspotting tracks, but looking at a couple videos online, and his most recent <a href="http://www.beatport.com/chart/sasha-s-july-chart/93085" title="http://www.beatport.com/chart/sasha-s-july-chart/93085">DJ chart</a>, his set had the following tracks:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgfmsoSgRvs" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgfmsoSgRvs">Rudimental Ft.

That moment was probably the single best music experience in my life.  The whole day lead up to this.  Almost 5 hours of building and building to the perfect moment.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3200.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3237.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3237.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3237.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3224.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3224.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3224.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3248_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3248_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3248_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>The beat picked up again, and the crowd went crazy.  To finish of his set he rolled into one the signature tracks of his upcoming Involver 3 album.  I was going crazy at this point.</p><p>Hot Chip - Flutes (Sasha Invol&lt;3r Remix)</p><p>Sasha was amazing, and put together with the festival as a whole, <b>Wavefront</b> was an incredible experience.  After going to North Coast and Spring Awakening, it was amazing going to a festival where I was completely in tune with the music.  I liked plenty of artists from North Coast and Spring Awakening, but both festivals have all the acts I care about in a Swiss cheese pattern.  Both festivals are geared towards the new generation of electronica fans, and the music I care about gets shoved in whatever time slots remain.</p><p>I really hope SpyBar achieved the success they hoped for with Wavefront, and I hope they make this a yearly event.  Though, it did kind of feel like a one off.  With all the popular electronic dance music these days, I think Chicago needed a reminder about what kind of electronic dance music makes this city unique.  And I think they definitely got it with Wavefront.</p><p>To finish, I'll leave you with my favorite quote from the reviews following the event.</p><p><em>"The Spring Awakening is the party that the kids thrown when their parents are away for the weekend whereas The Wavefront Music Festival is the party the parents throw once their kids go away to college."</em> - <a href="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2012/07/01/wavefront_music_fest_day_one_-_no_drop_no_love/index.php" title="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2012/07/01/wavefront_music_fest_day_one_-_no_drop_no_love/index.php">Katie Karpowicz</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago">Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He has had a residency at Ushuaia Beach Hotel, and hosting an event called "Never say Never."  As he puts it, this is chance for him to play any music he wants.  No expectations, no reservations.  Just spin all the tracks that give him inspiration from artists he loves and admires.</p><p>As such, the style of music is a bit different than his semi-typical Progressive House tone.  It's more light, semi-upbeat and rich Tech House.  But the feel is still Sasha.  The first time I heard a Never say Never, it was really odd.  The mixing and atmosphere was absolutely Sasha, but the music was all different.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha MixMag CD</b></div><p>You can take a listen for yourself. :)</p><p>For the November Issue of MixMag magazine, Sasha had the honor of developing and releasing a mix for their monthly guest CD.  Leading up to the actual release of the issue, Sasha mentioned heading back to the studio after a summer of traveling and playing various gigs.  And out of that came a few new tracks, along with some edits, and wonderful arrangement.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp"  /></p><p>1.

You can look all those up, and listen to them too :)</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha @ SpyBar</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120120_sasha/QseGN.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120120_sasha/QseGN.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120120_sasha/QseGN.webp"  /></p><p>As he spun his set at SpyBar, the music was absolutely drenched in Never say Never.  Out of all the times I've Sasha over the last 10 years, i have NEVER seen his as energetic, on having as much fun, or generally happy to spin his tracks.  He was moving around in the booth all night, shaking hands with the happy people up front, and even gave out his headphones at the end of the night.  (He got them back, though, after he went up for 2 encores.)</p><p>Every other time I've seen him spin, he seems so into the vibe, and stoic that it's hard to tell if he's actually having fun.  Digweed is somewhat similar too.  They stand there the whole night, and build and build, layer and layer.  Perhaps they're too much into the technical aspects of mixing and set building to actually have fun?  Or maybe Sasha feels like he's being pigeon holed into a specific genre, and mixing in other stuff won't work with what he's already built.</p><p>But he was having the time of his life in the booth this night, and it completely fed the crowd.  For being as crowded as it was, everyone had a smile across their face.  Lots of hand shaking, high fives, and hugs.  Sasha's good vibes energized everyone there.</p><p>It was very different than the (semi) normal douchebaggery crowd that tends to show up to a Chicago club.  Maybe the horrible weather scarred them away.  Or maybe because the crowd was 80% dude, there weren't any chicks around to bring out the douchebag clubber within.  Or it could be a combination that resulted in actual Sasha fans braving the weather, and filling the majority of the club.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and was holding my camera in the air the whole time to capture the audio.  All the video is up on youtube right now, with a bit of a tracklist.</p><p>Playlist //<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6</a></p><p>Chris Walsh<br/>0.

| November 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>October 2009 has been absolutely amazing.  The amount of talented musicians I've seen this month dwarf the entire year.  Seeing Moby Live for the first time was amazing, and John Digweed was incredibly powerful.  Dark Dark Dark came to town, and so did MC Chris along with his openers.  Each performance made me more and more excited for what was to end the month.  Sasha was returning to the midwest, and the day had finally arrived.</p><div class='title'><b>House of Blues</b></div><p>This was my first time to the House of Blues.  I've been to several clubs and venues in Chicago, but always manage to avoid the House of Blues somehow.  The House of Blues is somewhat close to Visions and Soundbar.  But unlike those clubs, House of Blues is more a venue.  It has an actual prominent stage that can be seen from almost anywhere in the place.  It's very easy to move around and talk with people too.</p><p>Being a venue, the people who attended the show were actual music fans.  It's quite a difference than the normal douchebag crowd you'd find at Visions.  It was rather refreshing.  Dave and I talked with a dude in the line about music while we waited.  And I talked with a few people inside too.  I'll certainly see some music nerds at Visions, but they are not as prominent as the rest of the club scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp"  /></p><p>Dave and I arrived at the House of Blues around 11pm and completely missed Chris Walsh and Wahi opening for Hernan Cattaneo.  This was my first time seeing him live.  And really, it was first time even listening to his music too.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_j_lEcpFlG4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>His sound was incredibly hard and deep.  It also echoed Electro to a degree.. but overall, very Tribal.  It was pretty damn amazing.  Though, I found it curious that he played at least 2 songs that Wahi played 3 weeks ago when Digweed was in town.  Hernan's tracks followed a somewhat predictable pattern, but that's not necessary a bad thing.  It made them more accessible and very easy to move to.  I definitely need to listen to this man some more. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp"  /></p><p>The tone of the atmosphere changed pretty quickly once Sasha got a hold of the decks.  The predictability went out the window.  And the sound became incredibly layered and ambient.  His selections were very organic.  The type of sound that fuses and shakes your body.  Like the rhythm of a heartbeat or the slapping of wooden instruments.</p><p>It was pretty amazing, too.  For a few years, I felt like I was drifting away from Sasha.  I felt like his sets were pretty solid and technically astounding, but lacked the variety that really made me a huge fan to begin with.  His set on this night felt like he was definitely returning to what made him an excellent DJ in the first place.</p><p>Mixing sounds that put him in a genre of his own, rather than simply Prog House.  It was all about layers.  Sounds building on other sounds.  Slowly building and slowly tearing down and slowly transitioning.  Like swimming in an ocean and letting the waves carry you to where ever...</p><p>Brilliant</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5rTbCHMOgsM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Wahi</b></div><p>It kinda sucks that we arrived too late to hear Wahi spin some songs, but hopefully he recorded what he did, so I can hear it later.

Though, Tim Shafer had already used that tagline to promote his upcoming game <a href="http://brutallegend.com" title="http://brutallegend.com">Brutal Legend</a>.</p><p>On with the events!</p><p><b>Thursday, October 1st</b> // Moby @ Myth, Minneapolis // <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60" title="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60">link</a><br/><b>Friday, October 9th</b> // Armin van Buuren @ Visions, Chicago<br/><b>Saturday October 10th</b> // John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago // <a href="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248">link</a><br/><b>Friday October 30th</b> // Sasha @ House of Blues, Chicago // <a href="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show">link</a><br/><b>Sunday November 1st</b> // Tiesto @ The Rave, Milwaukee</p><p>Sasha, Digweed AND Moby all in the same month!

But he completely skipped the Midwest!  Involver 2 was pretty cool, though. ^_^</p><p>Now that I have an iPod, I've been reacquainting myself with the music I have loved so much.  And then using that to springboard into music I've missed over the more recent years.  2003 Sasha to 2007 Sasha, 2008 and 2009.  I've been listening to it so much that I had hoped I would see him live rather soon.  It's rather fitting that he would be here a week after my birthday. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check out the following sets..  These are some of my favorites:</p><p>August 4th, 2002 // Essential Mix, Sasha @ Manumission, Priviledge, Ibiza<br/>June 27th, 2003 // Sasha @ Glastonbury 2003<br/>October 19th, 2003 // Sasha &amp; James Zabiela for Annie Nightengale<br/>August 11th, 2007 // Essential Mix, Sasha @ Cream, Amnesia, Ibiza<br/>July 31st, 2008 // Sasha @ Cream, Amnesia, Ibiza</p><p>Even since my introduction to Sasha through Wipeout 3 and Global Underground, I've been hooked.  For the most part, I've gone out of my way to catch him whenever he's nearby.  Except for one or twice, when I didn't know he was nearby or I was too busy with things.  As such, this will be my 8th time seeing him live (6th time solo).</p><p>April 24th, 2002 // Sasha + Digweed, Delta Heavy Tour @ The Quest, Minneapolis // <a href="/pages/sasha.htm" title="/pages/sasha.htm">text</a> &lt;-- god, horribly written.<br/>July 5th, 2003 // Sasha @ The Quest, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-the-quest" title="/sasha-the-quest">pics</a><br/>March 13th, 2004 // Sasha @ Visions, Chicago // <a href="/old/v7/sasha" title="/sasha">text</a>, <a href="/old/v7/sasha-vision-chicago" title="/sasha-vision-chicago">pics</a><br/>June 17th, 2004 // Sasha, Involver Tour @ Sound Bar, Chicago // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago">pics</a><br/>October 26th, 2004 // Sasha @ Club Escape, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis">pics</a><br/>June 10th, 2005 // Sasha, Fundacion Tour @ Sound Bar, Chicago // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2">pics</a><br/>April 16th, 2008 // Sasha + Digweed, Spring Tour @ Epic, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">post</a> <a href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">pics</a></p><div class='title'><b>Digweed</b></div><p>I've seen Digweed a couple times, aside from the times listed above w/ Sasha.</p><p>August 24th, 2004 // John Digweed @ Club Escape, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis">pics</a><br/>March 9th, 2007 // John Digweed @ Myth, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v7/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">post</a> <a href="/old/v7/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">pics</a></p><p>I find it really amazing who their sound changes from when they DJ solo and when they DJ together.</p><div class='title'><b>Armin, Tiesto</b></div><p>Armin is pretty sweet, but Tiesto is a bit of joke.

| September 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I don't keep up with music very well.</p><div class='title'><b>Ago</b></div><p>Over 4 years ago, I was going crazy when I heard the news about Sasha and Global Underground teaming to bring something new to the Electronic music scene.  The hype leading up to Involver was overwhelming for me.  I actually found the entire album on some torrent site, downloaded it, and listened to it constantly.  I loved every second of it.</p><p>It was very much the soundtrack to the Summer of 2004 for me.  I listened to it while driving from Minneapolis down to Chicago to see Sasha at Soundbar for his North American tour (<a href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago">pics</a>).  I listened to it while in Cleveland, Ohio driving around with Justin, waiting for Josh to get married.  I listened to it nearly every day driving back and forth to work at the Pharmacy.  Ah Memories...</p><p>That's in stark contrast to today where I didn't even realize Invol2ver existed until I saw some forum post on hybridized 2 days after Invol2ver was released.  If I knew about, I probably would've been going crazy.  But oh well.  Later that day, I found Invol2ver quite easily at B-side Records on State St. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>Invol2ver is very much in the same theme as Involver, but has a slightly different feel that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Involver was a summer diary for Sasha.  Each track signified a moment or a sound that he shopped around to each venue he visited from the months prior. He selected his favorite tracks, tore them completely apart and put them back together.  His work on Involver was much more than a simple remix.  It was really a reconstruction like a full-on production album.</p><p>Before reading about and catching up on Sasha, I didn't really feel like Invol2ver really lived up to the Involver name.  Some of the tracks felt very mute.  I didn't quite understand what the point was, or what these tracks meant.  The beginning just melted itself into something like Fundacion with little hints of Airdrawndagger.  The album did, eventually, pull itself into the Sasha Involver style.</p><p>For some reason, the little booklet didn't have any description or proof of concept like the first Involver.  But Global Underground had the description I was looking for.  And reminded me of what Sasha was up to lately.</p><div class='title'><b>Two Halves</b></div><p>The first half of Invol2ver is a diary of his emFire Collection.  It's very chill and nature.  The emFire collection is a soundtrack to a bunch of surfer videos.  But it eventually builds into his DJ experiences as of late.  The second half and ending brings me back to how I felt when I first heard Involver.  Very distinct melodies built off the underlying bass and movement.</p><p>Overall, I think Invol2ver accomplishes its goals, but the 2 different feelings of the emFire collection and his DJ experiences clash quite heavily.</p><p>For a mix album, it may have been better to have the Day and Night cycles on two separate discs, rather than mixing into each other.  It does form a story though.  Starting from daylight, at the beach, then watching the sun set on Miami, and then going to a club and dancing into the late night.</p><p>I guess that's why the 2 is smack dab in the middle of the title.  Invol2ver.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p>It's unfortunate that Sasha isn't touring in the midwest for his Invol2ver North American tour.  I'd really like to see what his set says about his CD release.  Though, I suppose for June 2004 it was very much in the style of Fundacion than Involver, so his North American might not say much of anything.</p><p>I saw him back in April 2008 for his Spring Tour with John Digweed, but I'm not sure when I saw Sasha before that.  His style has become very undistinct for me lately and June 2004 was the beginning.</p><p>The ending of Involver 1 really felt like this was the direction he was going.  The final song just trailed off into the distance.  But the ending of Invol2ver put a very distinct cap on the album.  I'd like to see if this means anything. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha &amp; Digweed @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">Sasha &amp; Digweed @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, I went up to Minneapolis to check out Sasha and Digweed on tour together for the first time in 6 years.  The last time, they brought the sounds of Delta Heavy throughout North America and the rest of the world.  This year, they're starting off the Spring season of clubbing the very same way.</p><p>In Minneapolis, they came to Epic, which everyone in Minneapolis would know formerly as The Quest.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting to Minneapolis</b></div><p>As most of you know, near the end of 2007 I smashed my car and have been making use of public transportation rather than buying a new one.  This works out pretty good for getting around madison, but making it outside of madison can be difficult.  Since I couldn't find anyone to go on a work night, I had to do a little investigating into the cheapest way to travel 300 miles north by north-west.</p><p>I settled on taking a fancy greyhound bus since it was super-cheap.  It cost $88 round-trip and took 5.5 hours.  That's almost cheaper than driving actually, since it was always take me almost 2 tanks of gas to get there and back.  PLUS, now I can sleep on the way up and have plenty of energy for the club.</p><p>The greyhound station in minneapolis was only a few blocks away from Epic, so this was a very very lucrative offer.  Unfortunately, I waited until the night before to buy the tickets, so I had to get to the station in Madison earlier than I would've liked to redeem my tickets.</p><p>It wasn't half bad...  Though, I got to Epic about half an hour early, so I sat outside until the doors opened.  The "line" was rather disappointing.  6 years ago when waiting outside of the same place half an hour early on a work night, the line stretched along the sidewalk to the edge of the building.  Today, around the same time, I was the only one that made up the line.  Rather sad, if you ask me, but it didn't that long for people to show up after I did.</p><div class='title'><b>Epic</b></div><p>Over half an hour later, music finally began to seep through the open doors and crawl into the streets like a mist.  After trying to figure out when we were going to get in, the music acted as a starting bell as we jumped off our marks and filed inside.</p><p>Epic was actually pretty nice.  It had been almost 3 years since the last time I stepped into the quest and that was when they shoveled James Holden up into the back room, rather than the main stage.  You could still tell it was the quest, but they made some very nice changes to the place to make it more accessible.</p><p>Changes such as flattening all of the first floor to the same level, rather than having a raised dance floor and a fenced off area in the back.  They also chucked all the chairs and tables on the ground floor, and had very few tables here and there for standing.  They took out a little bit of the balcony facing the stage and put in a stair-case right in the middle of the club, rather than going through the back room.  All those crappy TVs are gone and replaced with flat screens.  Nearly all the walls glow and change colors with the rest of the lights.</p><p>The Quest went through a huge makeover thanks to the new management.  Epic is still very much The Quest, but with much more than just a new coat of paint.  Plus that scafolding is no longer hugging the front of the building.  That's a huge plus.  There's still some road construction out front, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Kazel</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" /></p><p>The night began with the very solid sounds of Kazel.  He did an excellent job of setting the tone for the evening. I don't really remember most of his set because of what was to come after, but I was never bored during his time.  It built to the suspense and excitement of Sasha and Digweed.</p><p>At the same time, I was amusing myself with some of the crowd members.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" /></p><p>One of the most beautiful things of the evening, were the visuals up on the stage.  It was fitted with tons and tons of LED lights, which formed something simliar to a Jumbotron screen right in front of us.  The visuals used on these LEDs were stylistic 2D graphics in a 3D space.  Mostly shapes moving around and different colors, whee!  It was quite pretty.0</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha and Digweed</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" /></p><p>After plenty of time to build a massive crowd, Sasha and Digweed took over the stage, finished up Kazel's last track, and Sasha began his sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" /></p><p>Sasha took the point position with Abelton.  Unlike Delta Heavy or previous Sasha and Digweed collaborations, this was pure Sasha.  He has evolved passed fundacion, but it's still very similar.  His entire set up on the stage sounded like one big song, rather than flippin' back and forth from 'record' to 'record'.</p><p>I dunno... I feel like I'm missing something when I hear Sasha these days.  It's been like these since Fundacion for me.  Maybe I just don't have the ears..</p><p>Don't get me wrong though.. It was still pretty badass. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0609.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0609.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0609.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0612.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Digweed</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0643.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0643.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0643.webp" /></p><p>After an hour, It was John Digweed's turn.  Much like Sasha, Digweed played his own stuff and he played it hard.  In my opinion, Digweed totally stole the show.

The last I came across of sasha was back when his CD fundacion was released about 2 years ago.  I figured that he must've been up to something since then.</p><p>Well, he's not touring around, but he did release a CD between now and then.  That would be the title of this article, Sasha @ Avalon so on and so forth.  I wasn't that big a fan of fundacion but Airdrawndagger and Involver are two of my favorite CDs, so i'll give it a chance.</p><div class='title'><b>Limited Edition</b></div><p>No Luck, actually.  This CD is limited to a mere 10,000 copies, and when I searched for it on Amazon, Ebay and Half.com, the cheapest discs were going for $100.  I love Sasha, but with his current trend of music, there was no way I was going to put down that amount of cash for a CD.</p><p>Thank god for Google.  I checked to see where I could find this disc for the cheapest.  A couple places had it for $15 and $20.  Really?!  Oh wait, they're out of stock.  I continued to wade through these cheap out of stock copies, when I came across two sites that said they actually had it in stock..  walmart.com and Bull Moose audio.</p><p>No way.. they probably just forgot to update their inventories.  That didn't stop me though..  at $20 with a possibility of being in stock, why not just order it?  The least that could happen would be your order canceled and money returned.  So I went for it..  I ordered one copy from Walmart, and another from Bull Moose.</p><p>Success!  Both of my orders were processed, shipped, and received!</p><div class='title'><b>Presentation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" /></p><p>The packaging is pretty badass..  It comes in slip cases that look a lot replicas of vinyl sleeves.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" /></p><p>Quite a spectacular little collection for being a CD release of a live set.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>Sasha @ Avalon is very much in his fundacion style as of late.  Very progressive compared to his previous styles of Involver and pre-Involver.  Sasha's motive for music is to build upon many different layers of sound, which he's been systematic putting into his style ever since learning Abelton Live and going completely digital.</p><p>I don't get his new style, though.  He builds tons of layers, but all the layers eventually blend into each other, with no defintion of melody or sound.  It all sounds the exact same to me and very stands out what-so-ever.  When I listen to his new style, I completely forget I'm even listening to the music.  Later on, I'll check the playlist and realize I've gone through 5 or 6 songs already..  sigh.</p><p>Avalon is quite similar to this style but does break away into melody and definition in a few spots.  The first disc has a couple tracks that are wonderful..  Unlike all the fundacion tracks, I actually start humming them thinking back to the cd. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't enough of these tracks that make me love this cd as a whole.  These tracks are quite soothing, but don't bring the painting into a full composition.</p><p>Not only that, but he suffers a train wreck in the first track of the second cd.  What the hell is up with that?  The only reason this cd is so expensive is because of its rarity..  This is definitely one to download, rather than purchase.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on each individual track:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Soundbar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2">Sasha @ Soundbar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
