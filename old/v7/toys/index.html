| January 13, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lego has released some new botanical sets to usher in the new year. These two new releases complement the releases from summer last year to create "The Four Gentlemen" of flowers, a classic staple of Chinese art representing ideal virtues and each of the four seasons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These flowers (or plants) are the Chrysanthemum, the Plum Blossom, the Orchid, and the Bamboo, representing fall, winter, spring, and summer. I built each of these while streaming on Twitch, so take a look at the videos if you'd like.</p><p>Plum Blossom: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI</a><br/>Mini Orchid: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo</a><br/>Lucky Bamboo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M</a><br/>Chrysanthemum: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8</a></p><p>The Four Gentlemen or Four Noble Ones originated in Chinese art over 1000 years ago. The Kanji for this is <span class='ja'>四君子</span>, which reads <i>shikunshi</i> <span class='ja'>しくんし</span> in Japanese. Gentlemen, in this context, refers to an individual that exhibits virtues and morality that all people should aspire to. Each of the flowers represents different virtues stemming from their season.</p><p>In Lego release order, the Chrysanthemum <span class='ja'>菊</span> represents fall. Despite the cooler weather, the flower blooms with bright energetic warm colors. It's generally considered a loner as its virtue is to share joy and shine proudly as yourself withstanding all adversities. It also symbolizes longevity.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Winter is represented by the Plum Blossom <span class='ja'>梅</span>. Its petals bloom a sharp crimson contrasting the coldest whitest months of the year. Though, not the most beautiful flower, it continues the bloom its best in a time of the year when most other flowers can't survive. As such, the Plum represents inner beauty and humbleness.</p><p>Leading into the new year, the Orchid <span class='ja'>蘭</span> represents Spring. The orchid is a fragile flower, soft in a form and fragrance. It is often referred to as the most inoffensive flower. While Spring often represents new beginning, the orchid symbolizes nobility, friendship, and integrity, enduring life despite its frail form.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The blazing summer months are represented by the Bamboo <span class='ja'>竹</span>. Physically, the bamboo is the absolute strongest of the Four Gentlemen, able to bend without breaking against harsh winds and rain. By yielding and not breaking, its virtues are cultivation, integrity, and loyalty. Bamboo is also hollow despite its strength, which also represents tolerance, humility, and open-mindedness.</p><p>Altogether, the Four Gentlemen say you should be true to yourself, represent yourself with dignity and humility, and also stay true to others.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As Lego sets, these look amazing and pair really well with the full-sized <a href="lego-orchid" title="lego-orchid">Lego Orchid</a>, released in the second wave of Botanical sets in 2022. </p><p>Each of these sets have some form of repetition in their building, but it's really not bad considering each set only takes a full hour to build. The repetitious parts will only take about 5 minutes max. All sets have uncommon building techniques and parts usage that you probably hadn't thought of before. For example, the bulb of Chrysanthemum is created using over 30 lego bananas in different shades of yellow and orange. The flowers of the Mini Orchid use 3 handheld shield pieces, an interesting reference back to the Full Orchid, which uses 3 full-body shield pieces in its flowers.</p><p>Each are fun builds, look great, and are super cheap at only $30 each.</p><p>If you were going to buy only one set out of them all, it's hard to recommend just one. My favorites are the Bamboo and the Chrysanthemum. Both of these sets look amazing at both a distance and up close. Originally, I skipped the Chrysanthemum because I thought the orange would outshine the others. It does quickly draw the eye, but the subtle perfection of the Bamboo can hold your eye just as long. Even though both are striking, I think they stay in their own lane as part of an ensemble. I think the Mini Orchid is the weakest. The bulbs on the full Orchid look more like flowers and less like Lego than the Mini-version.</p><p>All of them together create a very nice ensemble. There's still room on that shelf for more flowers, so I'm looking forward to the next Botanical sets Lego plans on releasing this year, and beyond.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo Controller Button Set" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-controller-button-set">Nintendo Controller Button Set</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 3, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Exclusive at Nintendo Stores in Japan are oversized Gatcha machines with a set of toys called the Controller Button Collection <span class='ja'>コントローラーボタンコレクション</span>. Set 1 was released last year and focused on the original Famicom and NES. Over the summer, Nintendo released Set 2, which included Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and Gamecube.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Each pull costs 600<span class='ja'>円</span>. Because of the demand in summer, you would buy 1 or 2 tickets at a time, each for a pull. In July, I met some friends in Tokyo, and we went back and forth between buying tickets and hitting the button on the machine.</p><p>My main goal was getting both Super Nintendo and Super Famicom controllers. I did a total of 6 pulls, and got some duplicates. My friends were more fortunate with their duplicates, so after some trading, I was able to get most of them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm only missing the c-stick from the Gamecube controller. (But, I ordered one from Yahoo Auctions to complete the set)</p><p>These things are pretty amazing. They are near-perfect replicas of classic Nintendo controllers, which seem to use the same molds as the originals? Actually, Nintendo is probably using the same molds and plastics for their recent releases of the classic controllers on the Switch.</p><p>Inside are the same membranes used for the controllers too. There's a big plastic slab instead of a pcb.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I posted this now because I was in Kanazawa over the weekend with a student, and we stumbled upon a pop-up Nintendo Store. Out front, they had 3 gatcha machines: Button Set 1, Button Set 2, and the Zonai Gear Magnet set, which was apparently an exclusive pre-release. </p><p>The Zonai Gear are from Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, but they looked pretty crappy and low quality compared to the controllers. Typical gatcha garbage. Skip. I did one pull of the Button Set 2 for another chance at the one I was missing, or another Super Nintendo one. I pulled the Nintendo 64 buttons. Another whammy. They kids after me also pulled the same buttons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, these toys are really neat as a novelty. You could hang them from your bag, or maybe put them in your car. They aren't really useful otherwise, and don't necessarily display all that well either. But, it's fun to feel the buttons and control stick of the original controllers without having an original controller.</p><p>Definitely worth a pull or two if you're able.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Orchid" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-orchid">Lego Orchid</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Also, the balance very heavy on the left side.</p><p>Because I loved that Lego Bonsai Tree so much, I had bought a second one for cheap on Yahoo Auctions to make a slightly larger bonsai tree. So, rather than doing that, I could build it as normal and place it on the right side of the garden giving the scene more balance through framing.</p><div class='title'><b>Building a Second Bonsai Tree</b></div><p>It only took me an hour to put the set together, which is twice as fast as my previous build. Of course, this time I wasn't building to an audience on Twitch, and I had already done it before, so that accounted for the speed.</p><p>There were two things that were different this time:</p><div class='title'><b>The feet were different?</b></div><p>The first difference was the <b>feet for the base</b>. These feet were constructed using a 2x2 plate with a bottom technic pin, a technic tube, and a rubber something that went on the tube. These parts were totally different than my other Bonsai Tree and even the Tranquil Garden. The original set were made using a 2x2 plate with a bottom tire peg and a rubber tire. You can see the difference in the right photo below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I don't know why this is different, but you really can't tell in the finished design and it works the same way. I haven't looked into it, but maybe the Chinese version uses the cheaper parts? I don't know.</p><div class='title'><b>Balance Mod</b></div><p>When I built my first bonsai tree, I used a building mod that claimed to make a more balanced tree, and overall it did. The main branch went down the center of the tree, and two other shorter branches were on both sides. I started doing the same mod to this tree. But after building it, I decided to change. Not all trees have the same shape, so I thought it would look more natural if the trees looked different. I took it apart and went with the standard build.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The original design (on the right) is really weird. Nature does have a lot of randomness, but there's still a balance to it. However, there is not a stiff coordinated balance like the mod. Maybe there's a nice in-between, but whatever. In the end, it results in a different tree, as you'd expect.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On its own, the modded balanced tree looks way better just by itself. The unmodified tree on the left feels like it's missing a patch on the right side. But that's okay because it's just one piece of the overall scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Branch Blending</b></div><p>The cherry blossom leaves of the Bonsai Tree and Tranquil Garden are similar, but not the same. Both have white leaves, although they're different pieces. Both use magenta flowers with stud pegs. But for pink flowers, the Bonsai tree uses frogs and the Garden uses stud flowers.</p><p>I wanted all the leaves of the cherry blossom trees to be more uniform, which meant sharing pieces across all of the leaves. The magenta pieces were fine, but the pink pieces were heavy on the Bonsai tree, light on the Garden trees.</p><p>Doing some math, each Bonsai tree has 20 leaves for its tree. The Garden trees have a total of 17. In total, 57 leaves across the three sets. Each Bonsai leaf had 5 frogs, for a total of 200 pink frogs across both sets. That means each leaf should have 3.5 frogs. Each Garden leaf had 4 small flowers, for a total of 58 flower pieces. Easy. Each leaf should have one flower peg.</p><p>I started taking things apart and moving pieces around, and in the end, things looked much better than before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Garden trees still look a little sparse. But, that's because the leaves are spread apart more than the Bonsai tree. Outside of other mods, you can't really help it.</p><div class='title'><b>Light Kit</b></div><p>When I bought the second Bonsai tree, I also bought a second light kit. Having installed one previously, it was WAYY easier to put together this time. I knew exactly how I was going to hook everything up and it all came together pretty quickly.</p><p>In the end, it came together quite well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Both Bonsai trees bookend the Tranquil Garden perfectly and create a scene with the tea house slightly peering through the white and pink branches. I ended up switching the position of the Bonsai trees because of the empty patch of the unmodified tree fits well next to the trees from the Garden.</p><p>It looks great during the day with natural light, and looks great at night with the LEDs flipped on. The photo is a little blown out so it makes the LEDs look brighter than the are, but it looks great in person.</p><p>Perhaps the only problem is how dim the Garden looks compared to the tree. Again, in person, it's not as bad as the photo, but it's still dark. Maybe I'll look into the LED set for that.</p><p>But, I'm really happy how it turned out. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Tranquil Garden" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-tranquil-garden">Lego Tranquil Garden</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In 2021, they released the <a href="/old/v7/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree">Lego Bonsai Tree</a>, the first in its new line of botanical sets which tried to remove as much of the Lego authentic as possible. From a distance, you could barely tell the flowers or trees were Lego. With its huge success, Lego continued to release more botanical sets.</p><p>Going into this summer, they announced their new sets, one of which was the Lego Tranquil Garden. This set attempted to replicate the scene of a Japanese garden. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6544_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After hearing about the Tranquil Garden, I was really looking forward to it. It wasn't TOOO expensive at $110, and it looked like the perfect companion set to the <a href="/old/v7/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree">Bonsai tree</a>, a set that I put together a few months ago, and absolutely love.</p><p>The Tranquil Garden came out on August 1st, and I bought it directly from Lego.com. 2 weeks later, when I finally had time away from work, I fired up the Twitch stream, and put it together with some folks watching. Overall, it took about 5 hours to put together.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKXRBkliKpc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>I'm not a huge Lego person (really I'm not), but this set was an absolute joy to put together.</p><p>The tea house was a pretty standard short build that used a lot of unique parts to complete the Japanese aesthetic, but the real amazing part was building the base. It was fun trying to figure out where the pond, path, bridge, and house were supposed to go in the end while building it up from the bottom.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6383_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6389_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Some YouTubers complained about the annoying correctness of having to place all the translucent blue water tiles, but it felt more like a puzzle to me. I think the Lego brand is so strong because creative people can take a set and build whatever they want and people looking for a more structured experience can follow the instructions to put the model together perfectly. Even in both cases, there's room to go the other way and build what you really want in the end.</p><p>With the final rock pieces added on the edge of the pond, 1x1 struts were created to support the tea house, and then it's connected.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6405_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6414_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The final part of the model created 6 interchangeable mostly tree modules for the 6 squares in the base. There were two somewhat sparse cherry blossom trees, a pine tree, some bamboo shoots, a small tree, and a stone lantern-like structure. The pine tree was really fragile, so I shoved an extra red bar down the center for stability.</p><p>With all the elements completed, the set really comes alive.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6422_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Because of the angled rocks and other curved building techniques, it doesn't immediately scream Lego.

To clash with the tranquility of nature, I bought a custom, somewhat creepy looking Joker figure from Yahoo Auctions. And, I bought a Batman keychain with my Lego.com order.

Many fans of both Lego and Playstation praised the set for how authentic it looked to the game source. Modern Lego designers love to use Lego's vast library of pieces and colors in unique ways to create something that looks less and less like Lego each time.</p><p>Recently I had built the Lego Bonsai tree, and absolutely loved it. I'm not really a fan of Lego's aesthetic and blocky models, and both the Bonsai Tree and the Horizon Tallneck sets, as well as many other modern sets, try to hide these features as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Tallneck has so many rounded edges, curved surfaces, and off-angled lines that it looks more like a regular plastic model, rather than a Lego model. Even the joints for each leg have incredible articulation, like an action figure.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp"></a></p><p>Even though the set retails for $100, I was able to get a "used" set from Yahoo Auctions for $40. Used means that the set was already opened and built. They were selling it already built, too. But for that price, I could easily disassemble it and build it up again as if it were the first time.</p><p>The package was pristine when I received it in the mail and it included almost all of the original empty bags that hold the pieces. It was really easy to take apart and organize into its newly opened state.</p><p>Then, on May 13th, I streamed myself building it.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RckDOp3RbAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>It was fun putting it together, but I didn't really have the same energy that I had with the Bonsai Tree. Maybe it was because I had already seen it completed, so there weren't any surprises.  But, I don't really like the overall look in person. I feel like it still retains some of that block Lego aesthetic even though they try to hide it as much as possible. It's also really big.</p><p>Originally, I was planning on modifying the base to add the Bonsai tree to it, but the Tallneck completely towers over the tree. They don't really compliment each other after all.</p><p>I had it on my shelf for about a month, but I decided to take it down and take it apart again. You can see this progress in the photos below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The whole process is kind of like taking apart a puzzle after you build it.

| April 22, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In 2021, Lego released the Bonsai Tree Lego set. This was one of two initial sets in the Botanical Collection, a series of Lego sets meant to show the vibrance and beauty of plant life. One of the goals of Lego has always been to replicate the real world within the constrictions of using Lego bricks. It originally did this as a child's toy, but has expanded year after to include sets specifically designed for adults. Modern adult Lego sets can feel a lot more like building a model, but with the ease and satisfaction of Lego bricks connecting together.</p><p>It has been a few years since it was released, but I finally decided to buy it. It retails for $50 in the US, or 6000<span class='ja'>円</span> over here. I also bought a lighting kit for $30.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" /></p><p>The Bonsai Tree is meant to embody both the beauty and simplicity of an actual bonsai tree. Also, it's meant to give you the creative freedom to mold and modify the tree however you like. Much like how you cut and mold the branches of a real bonsai tree, you can do the same with the Lego tree.</p><p>To get you started, the Bonsai Tree set comes with two options. Once you build the trunk of the tree and the branches, you can add on green leaves. This would make it look like a normal bonsai tree. Or, you could add white leaves and pink flowers to make the bonsai tree look like a cherry blossom tree.</p><p>One of the reasons that I wanted to buy this set was seeing the cherry blossom version of the tree online. So, I had to go that route.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Putting together the tree was so satisfying. It's really fascinating how far Lego sets have come over the last 40 years. People who work at Lego have grown up with Lego their whole life. They creatively use regular and unique pieces in different ways to create something that you wouldn't have noticed before.</p><p>It would've been so easy for them to make the tree go straight up from the ground, but the base of the tree uses hinges to angle it. Curved pieces are used to make the base of the trunk fatter and hide those hinges. Different colors of brown are used to make the tree look more dynamic and real. Tube pieces are used as main branches. Even both options of green leaves or pink flowers have different pieces and techniques to make the tree look different, and more like the actual tree they're trying to emulate.</p><p>Something that modern Lego LOVES to do is is hide all of their signature studs with smooth bricks. It turns the overall piece into something more like a model. Overall, it creates a very striking piece for your shelf.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" /></p><p>Before building the set, I looked online for ways on how people were modding their trees. Lots of people had very dynamic changes with colors and leaves. The booklet had some interesting ideas, too. On <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-76280/SFH_Bricks/10281-bonsai-tree-branch-rebuild/" title="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-76280/SFH_Bricks/10281-bonsai-tree-branch-rebuild/">Rebrickable</a>, I found instructions on how to slightly modify the branches to look more organic. (The original instructions have the branches fan out in a stiff Y-shape.)</p><p>The instructions for the Bonsai tree and this branch mod are included below:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNamaiqKfswlTF1-NyAaKceGuhVI-Kjv/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNamaiqKfswlTF1-NyAaKceGuhVI-Kjv/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_instructions.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_instructions.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_instructions.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNqYTkt9yqSid5Dip463n1Wx5CelmSPL/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNqYTkt9yqSid5Dip463n1Wx5CelmSPL/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_branch_rebuild_instructions.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_branch_rebuild_instructions.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/10281_bonsai_tree_branch_rebuild_instructions.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><div class='title'><b>LED Lighting Kit</b></div><p>Another mod that people were talking about online was an LED lighting kit. This was made by Lightailing, and they sell various LED kits for many popular Lego models. There are two variations sold for the bonsai tree: one for the green tree, and one for the pink tree. I purchased the appropriate one.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1962_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1963_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>There were a few other LED kits for the Bonsai kits, but I specifically liked this one because the LED lights were put compatible Lego bricks. Many other kits had LED lights stickers that you put on to the pieces, which I think completely goes against the spirit of Lego. You should always be able to take apart and modify an existing Lego set, and always be able to reuse pieces.</p><p>Several people online mentioned about how difficult these instructions were to follow, and they were absolutely correct. There are 3 strings of pinks lights meant to be put into the tree, but it's not clear which one is supposed to be used in which branch. In the end, I just ignored the instructions and put them up where they seemed appropriate. </p><p>This caused a mess of wires at the end. I assume all of those wires should have been the same length.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>But, besides the instructions, this kit is really nice. The wires are thin enough that you can place them between bricks to hide them. In the end, the only visible wires and the ones coming out of the back.</p><p>When the light are on, this set completely changes. All of the pink light from the LEDs wash over the white branches and turn everything pink. Once all of the gravel is added into the base, the light from the pot is very subtle and looks amazing when all other lights in the room are turned off.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1968_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1971_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Overall, I think this model looks amazing, and with the lights it looks even better. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2062_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_2088_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Building Video</b></div><p>I built this model on Twitch over the weekend with a few people watching.

I got the red version of the machine.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Given all the moving parts of this little capsule machine, it was best to leave everything in its package for later.

A miniature capsule machine for my shelf.</p><p>Now that I had one, I needed to have them all! I searched for the set on the Internet and learned what I could. This particular set was called <span class='ja'>ガチャガチャマシーン</span>３ (or Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3), and it was released in December 2021. So, it was already out in the wild for 3 months. I learned that you can buy full distributions of some capsule times on Amazon.  For Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3 that consisted of 24 capsules, which was 3 complete sets of 8 items: 3 red machines, 3 white machines, 1 pack of capsules, and 1 set of metal shelves.  So, the Capsules I had gotten were a 1/8 rare pull. The red machine was a typical 3/8 pull.</p><p>I continued searching on Yahoo Auctions to find someone selling the missing items in my set, but most people were selling a full set of 8 or selling the rare pulls for a lot of money. Eh. I gave up. One capsule machine is good enough. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Update - March 2023</b></div><p>This has continued to nag at me over the last year. The other day, I was back on Yahoo Auctions looking around and I saw an auction for the two unique pieces of the set I was missing: the white capsule machine and a set of the shelving. It was only $10, so why not?</p><p>Not long after they arrived in the mail. The White capsule machine was in perfect condition, looking amazing and working well. The shelving was not. The piece had clearly been sitting in the sun for an extended period of time because the rods were warped. You can notice this in the photos below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>When it sits on my shelf, you can't really notice.

| February 8, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I found a new hobby lately.  These toys are a pretty hot item.  Almost everywhere in the U.S., they are sold out.  Even the common ones can be tough to find.  And the uncommon and rare ones?  They sell pretty well on eBay.</p><p>In Japan, though...  they are not so scarce.  And after returning from winter vacation, I've been buying the ones difficult to find and reselling them on eBay.  An alternate title for this entry might be <b>Confessions of an Amiibo Scalper</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Amiibo</b></div><p>First, What are Amiibos?  Amiibos are these things:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are figurines of Nintendo characters created by Nintendo.  But in addition to being a figurine, each one has a chip in its based and can be used with various games on the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.  The most prominent game being the new Super Smash Brothers title.</p><p>The first wave of these figures was released in November last year.  However, given Nintendo's risk aversion and general misunderstanding of their demographic and fan base, they did not create enough figures to match demand, and certain figures became incredibly rare quite fast, and extremely difficult to find.  Additionally, this was on the heals of Christmas, so they became quite a hot item, and demand continued to increase.</p><p>That's in the U.S., though.  In Japan, most people don't care that much about video games.  The 3DS is pretty popular, and most kids have those.  But most families do not have home consoles because they're expensive, and take over the family TV which should be shared by everyone.  Also, kids don't really care about Smash Brothers.  They're more interested in Yokai Watch and Monster Hunter.  So, Amiibos aren't selling nearly as much as the states.  Also, I think they've shipped more in Japan, than in the states (at least per capita).</p><p>Before winter vacation, I spent some time reading about all the horror stories of gamers trying to get their hands on these things.  I thought, really?  A few weeks prior I saw a full display of (maybe) all the figures at a Toys R Us.  The prices on eBay seemed to corroborate with the stories.  Some figures were selling for 3 times their MRSP.  One in particular, <i>The Villager</i>, was closer to 7 times.  Amiibo figures retail for $12.</p><p>After coming back to Japan from winter vacation, I hopped on the Amiibo bandwagon purely to resell them on eBay.</p><div class='title'><b>Waves</b></div><p>At that time, there had been 2 release waves of figures.  From the first wave, <i>The Villager</i>, <i>Marth</i>, and <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i> were the uncommon or rare figures.  Though, I think <i>Samus</i>, and <i>Fox</i> are getting hard to find now.  From the second wave, <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> became quickly scarce.  <i>Captain Falcon</i> is starting to get rare, too.</p><p>In Tokyo, before returning to Takayama, I went to a few Toys R Us's and other stores, and easily found plenty <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I could not find any <i>Villagers</i>, though.  Those were actually rare in Japan, too.  After returning to Takayama, I found a <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Captain Falcon</i>, plus plenty more <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I've never seen a <i>Pitt</i>, either.</p><p>In January, Nintendo released their third wave of figures.  These figures would be released in the U.S. a few weeks later.  But, in the U.S., four of these figures were retailer exclusive, meaning you couldn't figure them just anywhere.  That was not the case in Japan.  These figures were <i>Rosalina</i> exclusive to Target, <i>Lucario</i> exclusive to Toys R Us, <i>Meta Knight</i> exclusive to Best Buy, and <i>Shulk</i> exclusive to Gamestop.  These seemed like they would be the most difficult to find in the states, so when they released in Japan, I bought plenty of each.  (Shulk has yet to release in Japan, though.)</p><div class='title'><b>Buying in Rural Japan</b></div><p>In large cities, you have tons of options, but out here in the forest and the mountains, the choices are much more limited.  Takayama isn't all that bad, though.  We have a Geo <span class='ja'>ゲオ</span>, and an Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span>.  Both stores have full displays of Amiibos and received full shipments of Wave 3.  Apita <span class='ja'>アピタ</span> has 'em, too, but seemed like they only received half a shipment of Wave 3.  That rental store in Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> occasionally has some, too.</p><p>Here's the display at my local Edion, taken on Sunday.  They had plenty of the common figures, and a few of the uncommon ones.  This is in STARK contrast to any shelves in America where only <i>Peach</i> can easily be found.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This weekend, I decided to drive around the Hida <span class='ja'>飛騨</span> area and raid all the stores for their rare and uncommon Amiibo figures.  I drove south to Gero, then west to Gujo, and quickly further south to Seki.</p><div class='title'><b>Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span></b></div><p>Still within the Hida region, comprising the southern towns and villages is Gero City, with Hagiwara <span class='ja'>萩原</span>, and Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span> being its population centers.  These are about an hour away from Takayama.  In Hagiwara, there's a Yamada Denki <span class='ja'>ヤマダ電機</span> with a Techland.  And in Gero, there's another Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span> with a Neverland.  These distinctions are important.  Without a Techland, or Neverland, these stores only sell appliances.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Both stores were pretty light.  It seemed like they each only got half shipments on the figures.  The Edion in Gero was so small, but they somehow packed everything inside.  Amiibos weren't on the shelves.  I asked, and they had boxes of them in the back.  I shifted through and found another <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i>.  I bought a <i>Rosalina</i> and a <i>Meta Knight</i> from Yamada.  Its <i>Lucario</i> was damaged.</p><div class='title'><b>Gujo <span class='ja'>郡上</span></b></div><p>Gujo is directly west of Gero.

That's not particularly huge, but the boon is being able to convert my yen into dollars, and being able to transfer that into my back account.

I've spent the money on music and artists.  I've bought plenty of games, too.  Ultimately, it's just trading old stuff for new stuff.  Getting rid of the stuff that doesn't matter, and keeping what does.</p><p>I found my lifetime sales total on ebay the other day.  As of Sunday, February 8th, I've made nearly $10,000 reselling crap on eBay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, eBay doesn't really keep user records further back than 3 months, so there's no way to see a breakdown of this number.  I would love to see a chart of my highs and lows throughout the past decade.  At one point, I was selling so many things that I actually became a top seller. It didn't last long since my supply was never all that large.  I was only a top seller for 3 months (2 of which were the grace period at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I should easily top $10,000 by the end of the week.  Also, I'm getting pretty close to Top Seller status again thanks to Amiibo.

I think this is the first Lego product I've bought (or received) in the last 20 years.  Some might think the idea of Lego Minecraft is ironic.  Others might say this serves absolutely no purpose.  Some might say this was only a matter of time.  And others might say it's art imitating art.</p><p>Minecraft is a computer game developed by swedish person Markus Persson, where you can destroy any piece of the environment, pick that piece up, and place it where ever you want.  Many people describe this game as Legos in of itself, as you move around pieces, and build whatever you want.  That's the mining part of Minecraft.</p><p>The other part of Minecraft is the crafting.  You can take these pieces that you've mined and created new objects, and build more elaborate structures beyond what the environment has given you to begin with.  And you can do whatever you want.</p><p>Many people describe Minecraft is "playing with Legos." In fact, you could argue that Minecraft is the truest most best Lego video game ever created.  Lego has put its stamp on countless other games and all that them fail at the basic concept of what Lego is 'built' on...</p><p>So it IS deeply ironic that this concept has come full circle into the physical realm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Development</b></div><p>This set of Legos has been in development since November last year.  As you might have noticed above, the brand Lego Cuusoo is thrown around a little bit.  Cuusoo is an online development program where Lego creators bring their ideas to a vote.</p><p>Here's the original Cuusoo entry for Minecraft : <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038" title="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038">http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038</a></p><p>All Cuusoo ideas are submitted and put to a vote.  If the idea gets 10,000 supporters, it goes into a development phase where the creators must prove their idea.  Once they've come up with a physical build of the Lego product, it's put in front of a panel of judges, and they vote on whether or not the product actually comes to market.</p><p>Legos are WAAYYYY more serious these days then they were when I was a kid.  I mean, at heart, they are still a kid's toy, and they plenty of sets for children.  But they have advanced sets for the people who grew up with the toy, and enjoy the simple aesthetic.  And even beyond that, this Cuusoo system is there for the people who enjoy building something out of nothing: The architect.  These days the toy goes beyond an age range, and delves into the intellectual range.</p><p>It's awesome that there's this creative outlet for all Lego architects out there, but I've almost always been more interested in the building aspect of Legos.  I liked deviating from the instructions when I was a kid, but I never had the resources to build something from nothing.  These days you can visit any of the Legoland locations and buy any specific Lego piece you need.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Building</b></div><p>Building this thing was pretty fun.  I followed the instructions, and built everything 'correctly'.  Minecraft has always been about digging under the surface and finding all the hidden treasures.  Through building a scene of your own, you are doing the exact opposite.  You are placing all the hidden ore, and items in the environment and covering them up.  It's almost like you're acting like the scenery generator in the game itself.</p><p>There are gold blocks and diamond blocks that are very obviously placed, but there are other elements placed within the scene that are completely obscured when viewing the finished product.  In the end, the builder is the only one that knows they're there.  It's a secret.</p><p>There's also a Lego Steve, and a Lego Creeper available in the set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess it's kind of dumb.  Despite Legos' timeless and ageless construction, I feel like I've grown out of them.  I loved them as a kid, but the aesthetic just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  I get that the limited construction of the tool has pushed the creativity of its users well beyond what it was originally intended for, and built its own community, Cuusoo, based on that, but...  I just feel like I'm passed them.  I don't enjoy the aesthetic anymore.  It's too distinctive.</p><p>Once the Lego structure is built...  then what?  It just sits on display.</p><p>But... I do appreciate this Lego set.  <b>I find it as art imitating art.</b> There are clear choices made in its construction that imitate the game exactly.  A 1x1x2 block of Lego is equivalent to a block in Minecraft, and that is consistent throughout the entire model.  You can't really mine any of the pieces, but its construction and existence mirrors the game.</p><p>It's very well done, and representative of the game.  Much like the feeling of building a home, or any structure in Minecraft channels the fun you had with Legos as a kid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway...  I like it.  I feel like the abstract nature of Lego is a perfect physical representation of Minecraft.</p><div class='title'><b>Update : June 18th</b></div><p>As you may have noticed from one of the photos above, I had enough Legos to make an extra head for Steve.  I did not have enough pieces left over to make a body, though, so I saw this as a sign to complete one of those quirky life goals on my bucket list: <b>Go to Legoland to purchase a single Lego piece.</b></p><p>I was in Chicago this weekend, and the suburbs of Chicago have two Lego stores right next to each other.  There's the Lego Store in Woodfield Mall, and the Lego Discovery Center just outside.  Each store has a thing called 'Pick a Brick' where they have bins of multiple colors and sizes of Legos bricks, and you can fill up a bucket with all the pieces you want.  It's generally $10 for 10lbs (if I recall), and the selection is limited for each store.</p><p>The Lego Discovery Center has the exact sized block I needed, but only in Bright Orange.  I went inside the Woodfield Mall, and they didn't have any bricks of that size at all.  BUT!  The trip was still a success.  I was able to purchase my 1x1 brick and create a friend for Steve to play with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" /></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/toys/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
