| August 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hey everyone.  These past few days, I've been doing a lot of work making some of our processors concurrently work on things.  Concurrency is the idea of having your program do many things at once, rather than linearly.  The major positive of doing this is a sharp performance gain.  For example, if you have 10 tasks that take 1 minute each to accomplish.  If you have one person do all these tasks it'll take 10 minutes.  If you have 10 equal people do one each, it'll take 1 minute to do all the work.  Pretty basic concept.</p><p>What's not so basic is how to go about implementing this in your code.  Let's say you have a function that does your work to complete this task:<br/><pre>public void doWork()<br/>{<br/>   ...<br/>}</pre><br/>and you have some Manager Class that is continuously running, looking for something to do.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         doWork();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>where acquireWork() will return null if there's no work to do.  Pretty standard operations.  You give this thing 10 1 minute tasks, it'll take 10 minutes to do them.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's use Threading!</b></div><p>Let's split some of this stuff up and use Threading.  Threads will spawn a new process that works aside from your current program.  When you start up a Thread, your main process will go on its merry way and let the thread do all the work.</p><p>To make a process run on a thread, you need your class to implement Runnable, and put all your work in the run() method you must implement..  So, let's do that with our doWork method.<br/><pre>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>now, back in our while(true) loop, we can spin off threads to do all the work, rather than getting holding up processor time doing all the work ourselves.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         new Thread(new WorkerThread(work)).start();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>the start() method will spin off your thread, while your main processor goes back to find more work for threads to do.  You give this thing 10 1 minutes tasks, it'll take around a minute for all those tasks to complete, but it'll take virtually no time for the main processor.</p><p><b>Note!</b> Do not use threads when your task operates on an overall chunk of data.  You want to give threads task that can be done completely independent of each other.</p><p>Not bad eh?  You've got the thing running smokin' fast..  Almost too fast though..  what happens when you get 100 tasks, or 1000 tasks.. or 1,000,000 tasks?!  You're going to run out of resources very fast, and eventually your program will probably throw some Out Of Memory Exceptions.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's not use Threading</b></div><p>You need to manage this stuff so it doesn't <em>spin</em> out of control.  That's where Executors come into play.  Executors manage all of your threads in a thread pool.  The main class you want to use is the ThreadPoolExecutor which has severals parameters in its constructor.  You specify how big your pool is, which type of waiting queue to use, how long to hold onto created threads, and, optionally, can specify a saturation policy.</p><p>It's quite customizable, so it can be confusing at first.  The Executors class is comprized of static methods with commonly used, pre-built ThreadPoolExecutors for ya.</p><p>There's the fixed pool executor, which will hold onto a specific amount of threads and when all those threads are busy it'll queue up the extras.  This is the perfect way to throttle the amount of work going on at once.  Say you have 10 1 minute tasks, but want only 5 people to work on them (budget reasons, probably).  When you get these 10 tasks at once, all 5 will work on the first 5 and when they finish them, they'll grab the next one in the queue.  If you get 1000 tasks, 995 of 'em will go straight to the queue.</p><p>There's also a cached pool executor, which will grow will the work.  It'll create new threads when there's a ton of work, but once things die down, it'll start giving back the resources to keep these threads alive.  meh..  There's not much difference in using a cached pool than starting up all the threads yourself.</p><p>Even though, the fixed pool bottles necks a lot of the work, it'll save system resources and prevent the program from running out of memory.</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ExecutorService exec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>It looks pretty indentical to the previous code.  Now it'll take about 2 minutes to go through those 10 1 minute tasks, but the program won't die when it gets 1,000,000 tasks.</p><div class='title'><b>Customizing the Executor</b></div><p>We can do better than this.</p><p>The workers are happy with their tasks, but the main process is going crazy.  Every little task that comes along will be taken right away and throw in the queue for the workers.  That's not too bad, unless you're doing some sort of transaction service.  If you open up a Transaction everytime you acquireWork, then you'll have 1,000 open transaction waiting to be processed sitting in the queue.</p><p>You could do away with the waiting pool completely, and never have an open task sitting in the queue.  This isn't such a bad idea, but what do you when all your threads are busy, and you give a new task to the executor?  You need a Saturation policy that will tell the executor what to do in this case.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturation Policies</b></div><p>By default, the Executor uses the Abort Policy, which just throws an exception.  Well, we probably don't want to do that.  There are two other ones that are available that aren't so great either:  DiscardPolicy, which will discard the new task, and DiscardOldestPolicy, which will discard the oldest piece of work that a thread is working on.  You defintely don't want to lose work, so discarding is out.  (and) Discarding the oldest piece of work?  You'd get into a cycle of constantly throwing away half worked on tasks.  Nothing would get done except the last remaining pieces of work.</p><p>If we're going to use a saturation policy, then we should use the Caller Runs policy, which uses the main process to execute the newest task when all threads are busy.  Then by the time the main processor finishes a task, the other threads should be ready to receive more work..  hell if not, the main processor can do the next one too.</p><p>This works out pretty well, since when times are busy everyone is jumping in to do the work.  The manager actually lend a helping hand ^_^.</p><p>There's one big problem with this though.  What happens when you have variable task lengths, and the manager ends up getting one that takes far longer to complete than normal?  Everything is held up by that one task, and your performance dips very quickly.  You should really only use this when you have tasks of predictable uniform completion time.</p><p>All of our tasks take 1 minute to complete, so using a Caller Runs policy should be fine.</p><p>I should note that the static Executors method return an ExecutorService, not a ThreadPoolExecutor, which actually have the setRejectionHandler that you use to set the saturation policy.  So you'll need to work around a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>This is pretty good except for one problem..  When you get six pieces of work, the 5 worker threads will get their work and the manager will work on the 6th.  Before the manager finishes task #6, all 5 workers will have finished their tasks, and now must wait for the manager to finish before they can get anything new.  Now you're wasting time again.</p><p>You can solve this by going back and using the waiting queue.  If you have your waiting queue the same size as your thread pool, then in that time when those workers finish their first piece of work, they'll have something new to work on right away.  When the manager finishes up his piece of work, the queue should be empty and ready to receive more work.  Very streamlined.</p><p>Now you'll need to actually make your own ThreadPoolExecutor, rather than using the pre-built one.  I start off by just copying the code from the Executors class and tweaking it a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec =  new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 5,<br/>              0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,<br/>              new LinkedBlockingQueue(5));<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>The LinkedBlockQueue is your waiting pool, and you must set the size in its constructor.I suppose one problem with this setup is.. What if you get 6 tasks, and then another 5 tasks a few seconds later?  Then, by the time the manager finishes up with task #6, the 5 workers will already been done and waiting for work.  Maybe this isn't the best implementation afterall..</p><p>but if you're working with a steady workflow and uniformally timed tasks..  you'll be fine.</p><div class='title'><b>Semaphores</b></div><p>Let's do something else..  Let's not use the Caller Runs policy, and let the manager just manage the workflow.  Instead of having the manager grabbing an extra task that can't be performed on because everyone is busy, we can halt the process until something is available by using a Semaphore.</p><p>A semaphore will have a certain amount of tickets that is acquired by using semaphore.acquire().  If you only give the Semaphore 10 tickets to hand out, you can only run semaphore.acquire() 10 times.  On the 11th time, semaphore.acquire() will wait for a ticket to be returned.  You return tickets be running semaphore.release().</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.  We want our ticket taker before any processing, and then the threads must return the tickets when they're done with their task.<br/><pre>private Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10);</p><p>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      semaphore.acquire();<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work, this));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</p><p>public void releaseSemaphore()<br/>{<br/>   semaphore.release();<br/>}</p><p>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;<br/>   private Manager manager;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work, Manager manager)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>      this.manager = manager;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>      manager.releaseSemaphor();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>Now the manager isn't constantly grabbing tasks when everyone is busy.  The semaphore will let him know when there's space free for a new task.  We don't need to setup a saturation policy, nor a waiting pool size, because with 5 worker threads and 10 tickets, the waiting queue will never exceed 5 tasks.</p><p>This seems like it would work pretty good in all situation.  The main processor isn't held up by anything, the worker threads will always have some work to do.</p><p>Not too shabby..</p><div class='title'><b>Fine-Tuning the Thread Pool</b></div><p>You can still get your processing power performance up just a little bit.  When a thread pool gets a task, it doesn't simply run Thread.start on it.  The task immediately goes into your blocking queue, and threads will take the task out of there to work on.  You have 3 basic types of Block Queues to use.</p><p>The LinkedBlockQueue I've found to be the slowest.  It uses your typical LinkedList setup.  The ArrayBlockingQueue runs faster, by using an Array.</p><p>If you don't plan on having any sort of waiting pool, you should definitely use the SynchronousQueue, which doesn't hold on to your tasks at all.  It passes them to a worker thread right away, without delay.</p><div class='title'><b>There you have it</b></div><p>There you have it..  running concurrent processes will provide you a decent performance gain, but make sure you manage them properly, or else you may be in trouble.</p><p>Never use Thread().start..  Use Executors instead.</p><p>The information was learning through reading the book Java: Concurrency in Practice, written by Brain Goetz with Tim Peierls, Joshua Block, Joseph Bowbeer, Dave Holmes, and Doug Lea.  Definitely check it out for more information of concurrency ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-first-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, the Wii finally got its first big release that wasn't a ported game from another console..  Metroid Prime 3 is out in stores, though you might have some difficultly locating it.  I traded in Big Brain Academy and Rayman Raving Rabbits to Gamestop for a full-price reserve a month or two ago, so i was set.  Also, when I went to pick it up today, I put in a reserve for Mass Effect. ^_^</p><p>I could hardly wait to play this game today.  Don't get me wrong, learning about concurrency and thread-safety, while implementing processes for work is rather interesting..  but it can't really compare against shooting things with the Wii-mote..  or can it?</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin...</b></div><p>As you wake up from Cryostasis, you are inside your spaceship.  You can look around, push buttons, but eventually have to open communications with the Starfleet, rendezvous with them, and speak with the admiral.  It's a very non-game moment where you're in character, much like the beginning of Half-life or Halo.  Once aboard the ship, you can walk around and talk with people.  Of course, you don't talk back..  you're a Nintendo Character, after all.</p><p>The gameplay is pretty fluid, but does take a little getting used to.  The biggest hurdle I've been trying to get over is that the Z button holds your view, rather than the B button, as it is in Resident Evil 4.  The B Button in Metroid is jump.  So when ever I try to fire at something, I end up jumping around first before actually locking on to them.  :slaps forehead:</p><p>As soon as I began walking around, Tony said that everyone online recommends switching your look to "advanced" rather than the defaulted "normal".  Thank you Tony/Internet.  Normal and Advanced are basically degrees of when your view will move with where you point the cursor.  In Normal you have to point near the edge of the screen before your viewpoint actually turns in that direction.  With Advanced, your viewpoint will always turn when the cursor isn't in the middle of the screen.  It will turn to the degree with respect to how far away your cursor is from the middle.  It feels much more natural.</p><p>There's also other neat little Wii-mote movements, like turning key-locks, pumping other locks, and swinging the nunchuck around to use the grapple-beam..  Everything is quite intuitive ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting into it..</b></div><p>There really hasn't been much of a story yet..  Space Pirates attack, you repel them..  You get infected by Plasma or whatever it's called..  You investigate other stuff..</p><p>The story telling style is rather awkwardly paced.  In some cases, you have full dialogue of your mission objectives and what is actually happening around you.  But in other instances, when you're on the planet fighting, the gameplay is directing the story..</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b>: At the beginning you have a bunch of your Bounty Hunter buddies, that help you fight off the space pirates.  Later, after you've all been infected, you search a planet where one of them had been last seen.  You end up fighting one of your pals after he's been completely corrupted, but NOT once do you ever show remorse for his situation, nor when you kill him.. </em></p><p><em>Metroid Prime 3 feels very disconnected emotionally because of this..  If Samus doesn't care about killing one of her friends, how am I supposed to feel any compassion towards her.  I don't see this motif changing..</em></p><div class='title'><b>Achievements..</b></div><p>Something pretty slick Metroid has adopted, is the notion of achievements..  and they take many different forms.  You get a little achievement when you scan a monster (red coins), when you scan some lore (blue coins), when you defeat a boss (yellow coins), and other little random ones (tags).  There's also green coins, which I haven't figured out how to get.</p><p>All the coins you acquire can be traded in for unlockables: Concept Art, Background music, and, my favorite, stuff for your car (spaceship).  You can get bumperstickers for your spaceship.  You can get Bobblehead figurines for your dashboards.  All kinds of stupid crap.  Most of them require green coins, though :/</p><p>The tags, on the other hand, work with your friends list.  I've gotten tags for killing 100 enemies, killing 200 enemies, and 2 other things which I can't recall.  You can use these tags to send a friend voucher to someone on your list.  I sent one to Erika and Dave..  What do they do?!</p><div class='title'><b>The Atmosphere..</b></div><p>One of the things I did love in Metroid Prime 1, was the music..  ESPECIALLY Phendrana, the Ice level.  The music was absolutely ambient, subtle, and atmospheric.  I just wanted to sit back and take it in..  So far, Metroid Prime 3's music has been sub-par to ass.  Honestly, it's so un-memorable, I can't even remember what it sounds like when I try to recall it.</p><p>Music in a game is pretty important for me..  It'll make a mediocre game memorable, and a fantastic game boring, for me.  All of my all-time favorite games have very much to do with having an excellent soundtrack.  So when a game is somewhat boring enough for me to notice that the music is pretty stupid, there's a problem.</p><p>I'm pretty disappointed by this, but there is FAR more game left to surprise.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I'm at..</b></div><p>After I finally exited out of Metroid Prime 3, my time was 4 hours.  I'm at 12% complete of the game, too.  I'm guessing I'll probably finish the game around 20 or 25 hours.  Remember, the percentage is the total amount of stuff done in the game, not your progression through the story.</p><p>Despite being disappointed by a couple things, I am having fun with it..  I can't wait to see what happens when we start getting into rogue Aurora Units and Metroid conspiracies..  I'll definitely be disappointed if neither of those two things happen.</p><p>Right now, there seems to be a lot going on..  So that's good ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to When does stuff come out?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/when-does-stuff-come-out">When does stuff come out?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last week saw the release of AAA title Bioshock, and this week, we have Metroid Prime on the Wii.  We've got a month until Halo 3, but it seems like nothing is really coming out in October.  Then on Nov 12th, everything is coming out at once.</p><p>What does this Christmas' release schedule actually look like?  Well let's see here...</p><p>Aug 28th - Wii - <b>Metroid Prime 3</b><br/>Aug 28th - 360 - Blue Dragon<br/>Aug 29th - XBLA - Puzzle Fighter II HD Remix<br/>Aug 30th - PSN - Puzzle Fighter II HD Remix</p><p>Sept 4th - PS3 - Lair<br/>Sept 5th - 360 - Stranglehold<br/>Sept 13th - PSP - <b>Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core (import)</b><br/>Sept 14th - PS3 - Stranglehold<br/>Sept 20th - PSP - R-Type Tactics (import)<br/>Sept 25th - 360 - <b>Halo 3</b><br/>Sept 25th - Wii - DDR Wii Edition<br/>Sept 25th - Wii - Dewey's Adventure<br/>Sept 25th - PS2 - <b>DDR Supernova 2</b></p><p>Oct 2nd - PC - Quake Wars<br/>Oct 9th - DS - Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass<br/>Oct 9th - PC - Half-life 2: The Orange Box<br/>Oct 9th - PSP - <b>Final Fantasy Tactics</b><br/>Oct 15th - 360 - Beautiful Katamari<br/>Oct 16th - PS2 - <b>Daisenryaku 7 Exceed</b><br/>Oct 18th - PS2 - Seaman 2 (import)<br/>Oct 23rd - PSP - <b>Castlevania: the Dracula Chronicles</b><br/>Oct 23rd - PS3 - Eye of Judgement<br/>Oct 23rd - Wii - Table Tennis<br/>Oct 23rd - DS - Phoenix Wright III<br/>Oct 28th - 360 - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 28th - PS3 - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 28th - Wii - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 29th - PS2 - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 29th - PS2 - Aqua Teen Hunger Force game<br/>Oct 29th - Wii - Endless Ocean (aka Forever Blue)<br/>Oct 30th - DS - Jam Sessions<br/>Oct 30th - PSP - Disgaea</p><p>Nov 5th - 360 - Call of Duty 4<br/>Nov 5th - PS3 - Call of Duty 4<br/>Nov 5th - Wii - Fire Emblem<br/>Nov 6th - PSP - <b>Silent Hill Origins</b><br/>Nov 6th - PS2 - DDR Disney Channel<br/>Nov 6th - Wii - Ghost Squad<br/>Nov 12th - PS3 - Unreal Tournament 3<br/>Nov 12th - Wii - <b>Super Mario Galaxy</b><br/>Nov 13th - 360 - <b>Mass Effect</b><br/>Nov 13th - Wii - NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams<br/>Nov 13th - Wii - Rayman Raving Rabbids 2<br/>Nov 13th - Wii - <b>Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles</b><br/>Nov 13th - Wii - Soul Calibur Legends<br/>Nov 13th - Wii - <b>Trauma Center: New Blood</b><br/>Nov 13th - Wii - Geometry Wars Galaxies<br/>Nov 13th - DS - Geometry Wars Galaxies<br/>Nov 13th - PSP - <b>Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus</b><br/>Nov 19th - PS3 - Haze<br/>Nov 19th - DS - Mario Party DS<br/>Nov 20th - DS - Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings<br/>Nov 20th - 360 - Rock Band<br/>Nov 20th - PS3 - Rock Band</p><p>Dec 3rd - Wii - Smash Brothers Brawl</p><p>(This is according to gamefaqs, gamespot, and other random sources, but cheifly gamefaqs)</p><p>Well actually, it looks like plenty of games are coming out in October.  Starting off with Orange Box and Final Fantasy Tactics and continuing on with Castlevania PSP.  There's also Guitar Hero III at the end of the month.</p><p>But Jesus..  A fair amount of note-worthy titles are actually coming out on November 13th.  Especially for the Wii..  Why the hell would any publisher on the Wii decide to release the same week as Super Mario Galaxy.  What brainiacs thought that one up?  I'll be buying Mass Effect that week, and also MGS:PO+ since it's $20 on amazon, but christ.  Under any other circumstances I probably would have picked up Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles and Trauma Center 2.  Probably NiGHTS as well.  Way to go, dipshits.</p><p>There are a couple other uncommon games coming out that will surely be looked over.  Like DDR Supernova 2, Daisenryaku 7 Exceed, R-Type Tactics and Seaman 2.  R-Type Tactics will probably get localized, so I could wait on that one..  if not, I'm sure it'll be easy to find in Japan when I visit there next.  There's a new DDR Disney Mix coming out too..</p><p>After looking over this list.. I think I've got my games picked out:</p><p>Aug 28th - Wii - <b>Metroid Prime 3</b><br/>Sept 25th - Ps2 - DDR Supernova 2<br/>Oct 9th - DS - <b>Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</b><br/>Oct 16th - Ps2 - Daisenryaku 7 Exceed<br/>Oct 23rd - PSP - <b>Castlevania Dracula Chronicles</b><br/>Nov 13th - 360 - <b>Mass Effect</b><br/>Nov 13th - PSP - Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops</p><p>Though, somewhere in there, I might also pick up Endless Ocean, Final Fantasy Tactics and Silent Hill Origins.. Also, I'm pretty sure Daisenryaku will get pushed back or canceled since it's a shmup and people don't care about shmups.</p><p>___</p><p>In other news, I got Phoenix Wright 3 in the mail today ^_^.</p><p>I played through the first chapter, and so far, it's just more of the same.  Exactly same gameplay as the 2nd game, with new music that doesn't stand up to the 1st one.  This is pretty much what I expected though after playing through Phoenix Wright 2..</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Headed Home" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/headed-home">Headed Home</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>All good things must come to an end, and I'm on the plane back to Madison.  I probably should have used another vacation day and stayed for the entirety of the Con, but I had pretty much done everything that PAX had to offer in these two days.  I think Ace & Jess are bringing Dan & Becky around to the Microsoft and Nintendo campuses, and then later to the "Mitsuwa" of Seattle..  but those things will always be there. ^_^  I can check 'em out next time.</p><p>For the plane rides I had picked up a couple games to keep me busy..  I wrote a long boring text file of getting these games.. but i think it's almost too boring to post..</p><p>I had Planet Puzzle League, which I purchased the weekend before up in Minneapolis..  And picked up Brain Age 2 and Rune Factory specifically for the trip.</p><div class='title'><b>Rune Factory</b></div><p>Rune Factory is a fantasy based harvest moon which features many RPG aspects into the genre.  I've been quite excited about this game..  In fact, I nearly imported it over a year ago, anticipating its release.  I was very happy to see it come to the states.</p><p>In Rune Factory, you are a wandering traveler with amnesia who stumbles upon a girl that needs someone to work on her farm.  You accept and begin working on the farm..  You eventually get a hoe and all the tools you need, and begin like any other harvest moon.</p><p>The twist is that there are several caves throughout the land which harbor monsters.  You can go down in these caves and kill monsters or you can "friend" them and have them work on your farm for you.</p><p>This game has an amazing amount of customability and open-ended-ness...  but it's boring as fuck.  most Harvest Moon games are..  Much like I mentioned in the last post, there are so many games out and coming out that who's going to spend 50 to 60 hours playing through Rune Factory when there are better options.</p><p>Also, it's not really all that good.  It takes a tremendous amount of patience with very little rewards..  But this is only my initial impression.  I played it for about 2 or 3 hours before not wanting to play it ever again..  I'm really not in the mood for this game and I don't know if I'll ever be.</p><p>I wouldn't really recommend this game..  But If you really really like harvest moon, I'm sure you'll like this game too.</p><div class='title'><b>Planet Puzzle League</b></div><p>God, I'm horrible at this game..  I've never been good at this game, and don't know why I never thought of that when buying it.  I much prefer Tetris and Dr. Mario to Puzzle League or Panel de Pon..</p><p>The puzzle modes are pretty fun, but I can't get anywhere in single player mode.</p><div class='title'><b>Brain Age 2</b></div><p>I'm a pretty big fan of Brain Age 1. I kept up with it for nearly 2 months..  I played it each and everyday, tracked my Brain Age, and got a daily stamp which eventually unlocked more things to do.  I've also got around 80% completion in the Sudoku category.  It was a no-brainer that I'd pick up the sequel.</p><p>There were a few problems with Brain Age 1.  Namely the fact that it didn't recognize when you said BLUE, but it was too damn easy.  I kept a very long streak of having a Brain Age of 20, the lowest possible.  My Brain Age chart is a flat line at the 20 mark.</p><p>Brain Age 2 features all new puzzles which are more challenging and grading is more harsh.  I started off with a Brain Age of 34, and even though I've tried my hardest over the weekend, I've only today managed to get past the 30 year old mark.  I love it.  It actually gives a me a challenge to overcome, rather than constantly get the highest possible score.</p><p>Sudoku in Brain Age 2 also raises the bar in difficultly.  I'm fairly decent at Sudoku and these "basic" puzzles take me about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.  That's about how long it takes me to complete an Expert level puzzle on the previous game.  At first, I was disappointed that both Brain Ages have only 100 Sudoku puzzles, but it's a good amount.  It'll still take you a decent amount of time to complete 'em.</p><p>With Brain Age 2 raising the bar on these games, it really disappointed me that Vision Training was so easy.</p><p>If like to be challenged by word and math puzzles, definitely pick up Brain Age 2.  It's only $20 ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>A few hours later..</b></div><p>Greetings from Detriot..  Both plane trips back and forth from Seattle have really taught me the importance of buying tickets WELL ahead of time, rather than a mere 4 weeks.  Sitting bitch for 4 hours in a seat that is narrowly widen than your body is the most uncomfortable 4 hours I've ever experienced..  aside from sitting bitch in the same fashion for 13 hours back from Japan..</p><p>Also, I wish American Airline tickets were cheaper than Northwest Airlines, because every single NWA flight I've been on contained loudmouth, inconsiderate douche bags, crying children who kick your seat, and that one passenger who makes a big scene on how they're being mistreated.  It never fails..  I don't get it.</p><p>I don't get how people can be so oblivious, inconsiderate, selfish and rude to complete strangers..  We're all on this flight together..  obviously you're complaining about how you're being treated, why the crap can't you realize you're doing the same to everyone else..  jesus.</p><p>Honestly, NWA is not bad at all..  I don't know why people all the passengers seems to think otherwise.  I seriously mean it this time..  I'm spending the extra $100 to fly something else, if the option exists.</p><p>ugh.. now I'm just blathering on about pointless topics..</p><p><b>edit/update</b>.. actually my flight from Detroit to Madison was absolutely perfect.  The plane was only filled around 40% and everyone had a great time.  It really made me forget about the flights from one big city to another.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Penny Arcade Expo - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/penny-arcade-expo-day-2">Penny Arcade Expo - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings all from Seattle again.  Yesterday, I spent most of the day running around in awe of everything.  My sense were overloaded and I was more in the mood of seeing everything as soon as possible, swiping all the free stuff, and..  pretty much taking in everything at once.  Actually, my first <em>first</em> objective was to find a copy of Phoenix Wright 3, but alas..  Pink Godzilla has not gotten a copy just yet.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0258.webp" /></p><p>sad...</p><p>Pink Godzilla did have two games..  well three games that sparked my interest, but nothing enough to purchase.  These were Doki Doki Mahou Showtime (i think that's the title) on the DS, Face Training on the DS, and Cosmic Smash for the Dreamcast.  Honestly, I don't think I'll get more than 5 minutes worth of OOhhh and AAahh out of the DS games.  And Cosmic Smash was $75..  just a little too pricey, despite being the only DVD cased Dreamcast I don't have.  hmm..  I probably should have taken a picture of these..  oh well.</p><p>Anyways, today was all about the games.  Watching demos, playing demos, and doing some hardcore video game journalism by writing up impressions on early builds which don't reflect the final product.</p><p>Here's a few pics from the way in:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0243.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0243.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0243.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0245.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0245.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Conan</b></div><p>by THQ for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3</p><p>Dan was super interested in Conan and defintely wanted to give it a whirl, so this was the first game of the day.  Conan is the story of Conan the Barbarian and his adventures storming spartan controlled camps and utterly tearing apart their bodies.  It was a pretty entertaining game to watch, since Conan has particular combos that lay havok on soldiers resulting in both arms being sliced off at the soldier followed up by a kick to the chest sending their head flying at the screen.</p><p>Honestly, I wonder how many next-gen titles have an M rating.  Doesn't it seem like every game you come across, you're either shooting up some guy, and slicing some dude across the chest?</p><p>Anyways, the game looking pretty fun.  Definitely not worth $60, as is the case with nearly all next-gen titles, but whenever the demo is available on Xbox live, check it out for well spent 20 minutes of senseless brutality.  The full version will probably be more of the same, which will probably get quite old after the first level or two.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0247.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0247.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0247.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</b></div><p>by Capcom for Xbox Live and PSN</p><p>While waiting for the Mass Effect live demo, I played a little bit of Puzzle Fighter since it was right next to me.</p><p>The HD remix looks quite beautiful, but some of the alterations in the game will keep me from downloading.  The sprites are beautiful, but the gems are needlessly overdone.  They sparkle with lens flares, and explode when destroyed, rather than shatter.  They make explosion sounds too, rather than shattering sounds :/</p><p>They also altered the gameplay a little bit.  They changed some character's drops to be more balanced, but they also changed around the patterns of gems that normally drop.  In the original, they was always one color that dropped more than the other through the match.  This made it easy to figure which color to group together and eventually build a massive gems out of to topple your opponent.</p><p>Now, this has changed so you start off having an abundance of one color, but eventually changing to another color before the Diamond drops.  Then after the diamond, it shifts again to another dominent color.  Pain in the ass for loyalists of Puzzle Fighter.</p><p>I guess the balancing and unpredictability isn't so bad..  but the stupid gem explosions and lens flares are absolutely needless.  Screw you, Capcom.</p><p>I wonder what stupid needless alterations will be in Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect</b></div><p>by Bioware, exclusively for Xbox 360</p><p>I've had a very disapproving relationship with Mass Effect based from my initial bias against the Xbox in general.  Despite actually liking the Xbox 360, and a couple games on the machine, ever since the original Xbox was announced and released, How dare microsoft and PC gaming tread into my territory of console gaming... blah blah blah.</p><p>When Mass Effect was announced, i didn't care at all.  Then i learned that Bioware was the developer and finally realized why people gave a shit about it.  Bioware had previously done such Game of the Year worthly titles as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2 on Xbox 1..  and later did Jade Empire.  All 3 of which I have never played, and also carried no interest towards.</p><p>After watching 1up's 15 minute Mass Effect preview, I suddenly saw why people were so ape shit about this title.  My hyped opinion went from "eh" to "damn..  maybe i'll rent it or something."  Definitely check out the video, btw.  I showed the video to a couple people and they were completely thrown back by it.</p><p>So today, Microsoft's booth held a live demo of Mass Effect which highlighted the conversation gameplay and the battle gameplay.  Ya know, the two key elements to any RPG-like game.  Conversation was amazingly smooth.  Conversation cues were easily integrated within a cutscene FAR more fluidly than KOTOR of Jade Empire.  You're able to select your response before the other's finish talking, so you aren't sitting at a selection screen of what to say..  The conversation actually feels like a real time conversation.</p><p>Past that, the fighting system is rather intuitive as well.  Mass Effect is really pioneering the first FPS RPG.  Switching back and forth between weapons is very fast, and it's just as easy to switch your teammates weapons too.  Hit a button and the weapon selection overlay is displayed.  Click on the weapon, and you're back in battle.</p><p>From watching the demo, I totally felt immersed within the conversation, the action, and the outcome of the decisions chosen through the demo.</p><p>After this, my hyped opinion went from "maybe rent" to "buy on day 1."  Honestly, this game is absolutely impressive.  The slow dialogue from KOTOR and Jade Empire is totally removed.  The shooting gameplay brings the action to a whole new level in their games.  See for yourself with 1up's preview..</p><p>The hilarious problem with Mass Effect is that the release date is November 12th.  The same day, Assassin's Creed, Super Mario Galaxy, NiGHTS 2, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, and about 5 other notable games are released.  The day that will probably have the greatest amount of video game sales the entire christmas season.  Actually, I don't really see this so much as a problem because I don't really care so much about those other games.  I'd buy Mass Effect before them, so all is good..  I might pick up Resident Evil if Circuit City has it for $40 though.</p><p>The most kickass piece of SWAG I've acquired from the Penny Arcade Expo has been the Mass Effect novel.</p><div class='title'><b>Penny Arcade Adventures</b></div><p>by Hothead Gaming for the PC</p><p>Next up, we went a few booths over to check out the Live demo of the Penny Arcade game.  I haven't been keeping up on this at all.  In fact, I really don't care since I don't think Penny Arcade is funny in the slightest.</p><p>The Demo started by going through the character creation process, and then started up the game playing that character.  The penny arcade game is very well drawn.  I might not like Tycho's humor so much, but Gabe's artwork is quite decent.   It's amazing to see how much his skills have improved over time.  Just check out today's comic, and then check out his first comic.  You will see 7 or 8 years of improvement.</p><p>I'm not really a big fan of the 3d presented in the game, but all the cutscenes are 2d, drawn by Gabe.  And the charcter you've made, is also in these cutscenes.  So each possible combination that can created from the Character creator is replicated in these 2d "hand" drawn cutscenes.  I don't think I've ever seen a game do that before..</p><p>The 2d cutscenes are great, but the gameplay is rather standard.  It's set up like your standard turn based RPG, where you get caught up in battles, and all that jazz.  It's kinda sad to see so much innovation in the Art and presentation, and have the game fall flat in how you play it. :/</p><p>Oh well...  Fans will still play through for the story, the humor and the art.  If you like Penny Arcade, you'll probably like the game ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0251.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0251.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0251.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Crisis 4</b></div><p>by Namco for Playstation 3</p><p>With the release of the Wii, you'd think that all these arcade shooters would be find an easy home where you didn't have to buy any more gun peripherals.  Well not true..  both Time Crisis 4 and House of the Dead 4 will be on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, respectively.  Pretty stupid..  At least it makes sense with Time Crisis, since that has always been Playstation exclusive, but House of the Dead?  eh.. I suppose the arcade HotD4 is using Sega's Xbox 360 unit.  Whatever..  I still want House of the Dead 4 on Wii.  Ghost Squad is crap.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0252.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0252.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0252.webp" /></p><p>For Time Crisis 4, Namco is releasing a new Guncon which has all the buttons of a Playstation controller represented.  It also features light sensors placed on the upper corners of your television to detect and report on your screen position.  It's the light gun of the future, seeing how TVs don't use progressive scan lines anymore.  You should be able to use this Gun on all previous Time Crisis games too.</p><p>Time Crisis 4 is kinda fun.  I never played it in the Arcade because shooting up zombies with an Uzi in House of the Dead 4 was WAY more fun than shooting terrorists for the billionth time.</p><p>Time Crisis 4 does feature weapon selecting which is a new change for the series.  You have your standard pistol, machine gun, shotgun, and grenade launcher.  Certain situations call for different attacks and certain bosses can be taken down faster with certain guns.  This adds a very real-time tactical approach to a very fast paced game.</p><p>Even with a few innovations, Time Crisis is just more of the same.  Hardcode Time Crisis fans will probably pick it up, but I really don't see the average gamer buying this.  I mean, the game'll be $60, and the gun will probably be another $20.  $80 on an Arcade shooter?!  Hell no.  You could spend half that, $40, on Ghost Squad for the Wii instead and not have that extra $20 for a peripheral.  This is why Namco puzzles me with this release.  Same with Sega and House of the Dead 4.  ARgghghghh..</p><p>Bring House of the Dead 4 to the Wii.  OR..  even better.  Bring House of the Dead collection to the Wii with new graphics.</p><p>Ummm..  what else did I play..</p><div class='title'><b>Vision Training</b></div><p>by Nintendo & Namco for the DS.</p><p>Nintendo had a pretty slick setup with DSes around the perimeter of several Wii setups with Mario Strikes, Fire Emblem and Metroid Prime 3.</p><p>I wanted to play Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass..  but the demo was so long, the people perched themselves in front of it for 20-30 minutes at a time.  It took forever to finally get on it.</p><p>The first time, I gave up on Zelda and tried out Vision Training, conveniently placed next to it.  It had one game where several C's popped on the screens and you had to recall which direction they were facing.  Pretty standard Training game.</p><p>It was so damn easy though.  First try, I got the first 8 in a row, and then screwed up on the last two.  I still got the high score though.  What the crap?!  In fact, everyone I saw play the game got a perfect score of having their vision age in their 20s.  What the hell do you have to do to fail it?</p><p>Vision Training was a pretty dumb attempt at another Training game..  skip.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0246.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</b></div><p>by Nintendo for Nintendo..  DS</p><p>After that waste of time, I got back up and stood in line determined to play Phantom Hourglass..  and after this fat guy in front of me got so fed up trying to figure out this simple puzzle.  The game was mine!</p><p>Watching this guy continuously fail at this puzzle already gave me enough time to know how to solve it.  There were a series of 4 levers, and you had to pull them in the correct order.  Two stone tablets on opposite ends of the room gave exact directors on which ones to pull when.  I was rather amazed this guy didn't get it.</p><p>The puzzle gave me the opportunity to use the MOST needed, MOST useful, MOST thoughtful piece of gameplay added to any video game..  A map that you can write on.  The one tablet said to pull the lever first.  I pulled down my menu and jotted the information down.  Then I did the same with the other tablet.  That is so damn useful..</p><p>The weird thing about Phantom Hourglass is that Link is controlled completely using the stylus.  You move the fairy around on the screen, and link runs in the direction.  You double tap stuff to interact with them.  To kill enemies, to talk to people, to pick up rocks and pots.  You draw a circle around yourself to do a spin attack.  It sounds really funky, but it works out pretty well.</p><p>And if you don't like that, I think you can switch back to the old style of control.</p><p>The demo was standard Legend of Zelda stuff though..  Solve puzzles.  Kill enemies.  Explore the island.  The large innovation is really the controls..  but it's still good 'ol Zelda at heart.</p><p>I read an interview with the producer of Phantom Hourglass a couple months ago.  When asked about what he felt about Nintendo's turn towards the casual and hardcore gaming concerns and all that.. something like that anyways.  He responded that Phantom Hourglass has been a very surprising success for Nintendo.  He's never seen so many "casual" gamers pick up a more "hardcore" game like Legend of Zelda.</p><p>Games like Brain Age and Wii Sports have been a gateway for these people into gaming, but games like Legend of Zelda have been a bridge into more traditional gaming, and have been made an even bigger success because of that.</p><p>He was pretty excited about it...  Although there's still plenty concern about Nintendo's shift towards more casual gaming.  I dont' really see it as anything to be concerned about just yet.  "Casual" and "Hardcore" games like Guitar Hero, Rockband and DDR have had and will have tremendous success because of both audiences..</p><p>Something that does concern me is Mario Party 8 being the Wii 2nd best selling game. :/</p><div class='title'><b>Assassin's Creed</b></div><p>by Ubisoft Montreal exclusively for the Playstation 3</p><p>This is another one of those games coming out on November 12th, but, really, the only game that PS3 owners will care about.  This is made by the developing minds by Prince of Persia Sands of Time and attempts to accomplish some very pretentious goals.</p><p>Assassin's Creed was presented as a panel headed by the chief Creative Designer.</p><p>I was pretty neat.  He started by going through a little bit of the design process.  What their goals were when creating this new IP for Ubisoft.  They wanted to do away with "video game" rules of physics and physical conduct, and keep much of the interaction with the world grounded..  but still bend that enough to make that game a lot of fun.</p><p>The set forth and designed a free roaming game engine that took the environment into account, rather than having scripted levels where the game already knew what you were going to do.  With such a flexible game engine, level designers had nearly ultimate freedom on the 3 cities of Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Another goal of the Assassin Team was to base the game in actual factual history, rather than just a setting.  The chief designer was a little bit of a history buff, and attempted to recreate the 1100 world of 3 major middle eastern cities including Jerusalem.  Assassin's Creed's Jerusalem isn't a picture perfect model, but you get the feel of having a massive city for you to traverse.</p><p>The Cheif Designer continued the presentation talking about the game engine and giving examples of it's free roaming capabilities.  He had a few movies of the character running around in the environment.  Then he'd restart the movie, move around the objects in the field, and play it again with the character being able to detect where everything had been moved to an act accordingly.  It was quite impressive.</p><p>Most of these interactable objects where wooden bars going across the tops of streets, and bricks sticking out of buildings.  Part of the free-roaming capabilities were jumping from these pegs to peg, and climbing up anything that stuck out of a wall at least 2 inches.  You didn't even need to press any buttons to interact with these objects..  Simply walk up to them and the game knows what you want to do, and it'll do it.  Run into a wall and you'll climb up it.  Run off the edge of the building and if there's something to jump to, you'll do it.  No sense cluttering the controls with useless functions when the game will do it for you.</p><p>That's simply the gameplay mechanics of movement.  He went on to discuss character interactions which was part of another Goal: Crowds.  Not enough games, he said, give you a real sense of a city.  In a city, you have millions of people walking around.  And you can't just run at full speed through the crowd..  You run into physical resistance.  With Assassin's Creed you can gentle push people out of your way, knock people over, and easily get knocked over or pushed as well.</p><p>People don't just sit back and let you knock around the good citizens of Jerusalem.  You've got a price to pay for being an asshole.  People will start pushing back.  And if you start a fight with a perfect stranger, good citizens will rise up against you and make you pay.  Not to mention if a guard sees you fucking around, you can expect a battle.</p><p>Next he delves into combat, and talked about how he tried to bring realism into the fight scene too..  That one really wasn't as apparent as the previous two goals.  It just looked like Fable or whatever..</p><p>Overall, Assassin's Creed looked pretty bad ass.  The free-roaming nature was not unlike taking Grand Theft Auto to the next level but back in time.  I can see Playstation 3 owners being very happy about this game.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest of the day...</b></div><p>That was pretty much it for games throughout the day..  There are some pretty fun games coming out, but a far too many sub-par games for the price of $60.  I'll spend the $70 on Mass Effect's Collector's Edition, but beyond that..  I'm going to take advantage of any deal for a next-gen game at full price..  Meaning that, Circuit City's $10 off a newly released game will have my business if i want a newly released game.</p><p>There are so many games coming out this Christmas season..  So much competition..  I think that a lot of games are going to get overlooked just because people are still playing the games from the previous month or two.  If Bioshock came out in November, there's no way it would have the same success as it had this week.  No way in hell.</p><p>Anyways, After we returned from Ivan's down on the shoreline, I attended the 1up Yours live show a little late.  Theater B wasn't really much of a theater than it was a corner of the large entrance hall.  That made hearing anything very difficult through the ambiance of chatter throughout the Con.  Overall, hearing it didn't really matter so much, since it'll be online this coming Friday..  It was neat to see all the 1up Yours guys in person doing their show.</p><p>Afterwards, I went up to the tables, shook their hands, and got a photo of 'em, minus Garnet.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0257.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0257.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0257.webp" /></p><p>Good times ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>On into the night...</b></div><p>After the 1up Yours live show, we headed to the Auditorium to catch all the evening's concerts.  First up was Gabe, Tycho and the Omeganauts playing Rockband.  Next with Jonathon Coulton,  Then MC Frontalot.  And finally the Minibosses.</p><p>I had never heard of Jonathon Coulton, but everyone I was with certainly had.  His songs were pretty damn hilarious..  Check 'em out.. I'm sure they're on his site.</p><p>Seeing the Minibosses live was another one of those Life Goals of mine which had finally be achieved.  The Minibosses were pretty much the first all video game remix band.  They exclusively did background music from NES games.  Castlevania 1, 2, 3, Megaman 2, Super Mario 2, Excitebike, Double Dragon, Metroid..  all using Guitar Riffs.  They began the night with the opening scene of Super Metroid on the Space Colony.</p><p>I've loved the Minibosses ever since first coming across one of their songs on the internet in the early 2000s.  If I looked around enough through my files, I could probably pinpoint a more specific year.</p><p>The night was just as fantastic as the day.</p><div class='title'><b>As a whole...</b></div><p>The Penny Arcade Expo was quite amazing.  As mentioned before, this has been the most organized Con I have ever been to.  It has been a joy to attend, and seeing the smiles on everyone's faces is proof that I'm not the only one.  I will gladly attend next year.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Penny Arcade Expo - Day 1" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/penny-arcade-expo-day-1">Penny Arcade Expo - Day 1</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings everyone from Seattle, one of the greatest places in the United States.  The air is rather pure, with a slight accent of pine, the streets are rather clean for a rather large metropolis, and there are farely few bums to be found.</p><p>I'm in Seattle because of the nation's large gaming get together, the <b>Penny Arcade Expo</b> or PAX.  The year is year number 4, which has been relocated to the Washington Community Center where I had attended Sakura-con back in April.</p><p>Last night, I got into the area around Midnight or so, met up with Dan & Becky, and pretty much went straight to bed since Midnight = 2AM local time, for me.  This morning I woke up at 7AM, which is pretty amazing.  Rarely am I awake and ready to hit the town so early, until I realized, it was actualy 9AM local time, for me.</p><p>We got over to PAX about 8.30-ish where the line had already begun to form, despite PAX not opening until 2pm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" /></p><p>The line was kinda long, but was it really worth it to sit in line for close to 5 hours, just to get inside right as it opened? I mean, the Con itself will be pretty widely opened later.  Yeah, screw this line crap.  let's tour!</p><p>We went down the road to Pike's Peer or Pike's Place or whatever you wish to call it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" /></p><p>Pike's Peer is a cornucopia of local farmers, fisherman, floral-men, gift shops, etc. all along the waterfront of the Seattle bay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" /></p><p>Absolutely beautiful..  How can you not love Seattle.  Honestly..</p><p>Also on Pike's Peer is the Starbucks Number 1.  The first Starbucks ever made.  The originator.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" /></p><p>Out front were a bunch of hippy musicians.</p><p>This stand has a bunch of chiles on a string!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" /></p><p>Inside Pike's Peer was an aptly named sushi bar, Umai Sushi & Teriyaki.  Umai is kind of a trendy word for delicious or super delicious in Japan.  Kinda like "Yum" or "Yummy" in our vocabulary.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" /></p><p>After Pike's Peer we walked past the Art Museum, and visited the Seattle Public Library, which is a marvel of modern-esq architecture..  Difficult to photograph in tight quarters though :/</p><p>It was starting to get close to 2pm, so we decided to head back to PAX and sit in line once again.  We took a shortcut through the park</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" /></p><p>Back at the Con, the line had grown just a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" /></p><p>But it really wasn't too long before began to move, and we were past the gates and inside the exhibition hall.</p><p>more pictures!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" /></p><p>4pm rolled around very quickly, which was when the guest of honor, Wil Wheaton, was to give his keynote speach.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" /></p><p>Wil Wheaton gave an amazing speech of his childhood growing up with games, what games really meant to him, and how gaming is really the social pinacle of our lives as gamers.  The fact that gaming a social medium on the same level as any other hobby, and it is also an artist medium on the same level as movies and fine art.</p><p>He also blasted any political critics that defined gaming as anti-social, because in our own lives, gaming is nothing but a social activity.  How else would 30,000 gamers come together at one location to be with each other, simply because we ARE gamers.  This is no difficult than a bunch of sports fan packing into a stadium to watch a game.  Nothing different than state citizens coming together for a state fair.</p><p>As he said to finish off his speech..  if you find someone who thinks that gaming is anti-social.  you should invite him over sometime to play a game, and see what they think of it. ^_^</p><p>Great speech overall..  Hopefully the PAX07 dvd will be released containing it.  If not, hopefully the video will pop up on YouTube at some point.  It's probably there now..  maybe.</p><p>After Wil Wheaton's speech, Gabe and Tycho take the stage for some hilarious Q & A.  One Q resulted in Tycho singing on stage, which resulted in everyone holding their lighters in the air, or in the case of us gamers..  our DS screens.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" /></p><p>As a special ironic treat, Gabe & Tycho has a special guest star for an improtu appearance after their Q&A.  Someone reveared in the gaming community.  To their dismay, they were unable to get Jack Thompson to attend, but got the next best guest..  Uwe Boll.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" /></p><p>haha.  It was rather hilarious that they actually got him to come to PAX and speak to the crowd..  but it didn't really pay off all that much.  This guy is pretty damn boring, and just ended up talking about random things that weren't interesting.  Joystiq taped a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/25/pax-07-uwe-bolls-guest-appearance-on-video/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/25/pax-07-uwe-bolls-guest-appearance-on-video/">video of Uwe Boll on stage</a>.</p><p>Outside, I ran into Mr. Destructoid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" /></p><p>And we continued looking around the exhibition hall.</p><p>They had an aquarium cooled PC box.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" /></p><p>It was around this time that we caught up with Ace & Jess, who were working at the Con, later in the night.  We went a couple blocks away to an amazing Asia-esq restaurant, Wild Ginger.  A very trendy semi-upscale restaurant where the food was fantastic.  I had the Mushrooms and Peapods.</p><p>Back at the Con, we were getting pretty tired but hung around a little while for the One-Ups, which were the first headliners at this evenings concert.  The was starting to wear on us though, so we began to make our way back to the room for the evening.<br/>___</p><p>I must say that PAX is quite impressive.  Not only have a had a great time seeing a ton of new games, met Mr. Destructoid, listened to Wil Wheaton talk passionately about gaming, and so forth.. but the Con itself is amazing organized.  For already having 30,000 registered people at this Con, everything is spread out enough that you're hardly cramped for space.</p><p>Even all the standing in lines hasn't been that bad at all because everyone had been sifted off into areas that could accommodate everyone.</p><p>There's so little frustration with the way everything in being handled that all you see is everyone having a great time.  No one is pissed off, or bitchy.  When you look at random people, they have smiles across their faces.</p><p>So far, I'm having a great time here, and it's really amazing to have that Con spirit rekindled inside of myself after getting so damn bored at Anime Conventions.  These resurfaced feelings of being at Con remind of the first time I went to Anime Iowa back in 2002 or 2001.</p><p>Fantastic.<br/>___</p><p>Anywho.. more to follow on tomorrow's events. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Recent Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/recent-movies">Recent Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This summer has been pretty kickass for movies.  In fact, I don't think there's been a summer where I've gone out and seen so many movies.  Transformers, The Simpsons, Superpad, Bourne Ultimatum, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Spiderman 3, Live Free or Die Hard..  All of them entertaining, and some pretty good.</p><p>There are two other movies I've seen this summer which are also pretty good, but not as widely talked about as these big Blockbusters..</p><p><b>The Invasion</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>This past weekend, when I was back home in Minneapolis my little brother and I caught The Invasion, starring Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  The Invasion is about an alien invasion on earth based off of the novel Body Snatchers, and somewhat of a remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Nicole Kidman is a now divorced single mom who is loosely dating Daniel Craig, when the invasion begins.  They try to survive, all while solving the key to defeating the aliens.</p><p>The Invasion is the most passive alien invasion I have ever witnessed in film.  These aliens are micro-organisms which infect humans by mutating nerve cells.  Once the individual falls asleep, the organisms take advantage of our involuntary glandular sweating to transform us from who we were, into their completely controlled slaves.  We're still who we are.. we're just controlled by them.</p><p>The first hour of the movie is their subtle take-over of humanity.  Once the main characters figure out what's going on, it's too late and it becomes a race for survival.  Nicole Kidman's son is immune to their advances and Nicole Kidman must retrieve him and bring him to the resistance to develop a cure.  But, she's been infected and must keep herself from falling asleep and turning into a slave.</p><p>The Invasion is very intense.  It's a lot like a zombie movie..  the fear of being discovered while hiding from the zombies.  the intense action of running away from zombies.  The Invasion ends strong, but begins very weak.  It's not the best movie in the world, but for some reason..  it really sticks with me.  Probably because i really like Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  Plus, some the zombie/aliens are quite creepy and spooky.. like that little Asian kid.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion:</em></b> Anywho, catch it out, if you're so inclined.  It's not half bad..</p><p><b>Stardust</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>Stardust is a fantasy fairy-tale written by Neil Gaiman.  I saw this about a week ago down in Rockford with Erika and Stephen.</p><p>Stardust's main hero is a boy named Tristan and his story of becoming a man.  He lives in a little english town called Wall, which is bordered by a wall that humans must never pass through.  Beyond the wall lies the fairy-tale kingdom of Stormhold, where, this very day, the King lie on his death bed.  Stormhold has a tradition that only a solitary living heir may ascend the throne..  which is a problem since 4 sons still live.  As the king, played by Peter O'Toole, draws his finally breath..  the one to ascend the throne will turn his now diamond pendent back into a Ruby.</p><p>Ok, I'm going to stop right here and not give away the entire movie.  Suffice to say, a star falls to earth which Tristan wishes to capture for his "true love".  But the witch wished to possess this star for immortality.  The ruby knocked the star out of the sky, so the Star has the Pendant on her.  Everyone is after the Star, which Tristan finds first.</p><p>This movie is quite a gem.  It features several all-star actors, Peter O'Toole, Michele Pfeiffer, Claire Daines, Robert De Niro, and Ian McKellen..</p><p>Stardust reminds me a lot of Princess Bride.  It's completely ridiculous and never takes itself seriously, but still retains a serious plot and presents a wonderful tale of love and adventure.  There were times I smacked myself on the head because it was so dumb, but also warmed my heart at the cutesy scenes.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think it'll reach the cult star power that Princess Bride has these days, but it might if the proper crowd gets a hold of it.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion: </em></b> Definitely check it out. ^_^  Great date movie.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 21, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dexter is a television program on Showtime.  Dexter, played by Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under fame, is a serial killer.  His victims happen to be other serial killer and murderers.  This is the way he balances out his serial killer need for bloodshed while performing acts of good.  A vigilante at night, but a forensics officer during the day, solving crimes and misdeeds of bloodshed and foreplay.  One job helps facilitate the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 1</b></div><p>However, Dexter's word is turned upside down with the emergence of a true rival.  A serial killer with true value of cleanliness, precision, and love towards his killing methods.  This killer leaves hints for Dexter.  Plays with Dexter.  Looks for a friend in Dexter.  and Dexter finds a playmate in him.</p><p>Dexter is a wonderfully crafted, suspenseful show that will leave you wanting more and more.  I was first recommended to watch this show when I returned from Japan and visited Platteville for the first time.  Matt, Dave, Jamie and Tony were all in agreement that I needed to see this..  but I was busy dealing with the depression of being back in the states.  Luckily, when I visited Justin in North Carolina he was of the same opinion, sat me down with Showtime on Demand, and let me be.</p><p>Season 1 just came out today on DVD, and I definitely recommend this show to those who haven't seen it.  Unlike those arrogantly priced HBO series, Showtime has priced Dexter Season 1 at $40 MSRP..  but you can pick it up all 12 episodes of season 1 for $30 at Best Buy this week.</p><div class='title'><b>Showtime v. HBO</b></div><p>Showtime is really pushing the public towards this show, it seems.  Now that HBO is basically dead, and half a million subscribers canceled their service because Sopranos is now done, Showtime sees this as its chance to pull in as many of that audience as possible.  Dexter is a strong strong show.</p><p>Hell, we almost switched over to Showtime from HBO because of the Sopranos and Dexter, but ended up just quitting HBO.  Sorry, but John from Cincinnati is ass.</p><p>These real high profile pay-channel TV programs really start off strong, for the most part.  Sopranos Season 1 and 2 were amazing, but then began to wither in Season 3.  Six Feet Under Seasons 1 and 2 were equally amazing, but again.. lost all steam in Season 3.  Deadwood didn't keep it's amazing quality past Season 1.  Season 2 killed it.  And Now John from Cincinnati can't even start up strong.</p><p>Season 1 of Dexter was quit well done, despite a couple stereotypical drama-like plot devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 2</b></div><p>Episodes 1 and 2 of Dexter Season 2 have been "leaked" on the Internet.  I just finished watching them and this show really raised the bar.  I can't wait for episode 3...  which'll be in the second week of October :/</p><p>I use the term "leaked" loosely because if I were Showtime, I would send out the first episode or two to generate even more buzz on the show.  I mean, I want to see Season 2 now more than ever thanks to that 2 hour teaser.  It makes decent sense.</p><p>The first two episodes work very well with each other and tie up most of the stuff brought up in this episodes.</p><div class='title'><b>Anywho..</b></div><p>Definitely great stuff..  But, Rent or Netflix Dexter Season 1 today.  ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Planet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-planet">Lost Planet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lost Planet is one of those super-hyped games on the 360 last Christmas season.  Superb Graphics, Superb Gameplay, Superb so forth..  Right before It came out, all the retails had in store demos, and when I played the game, I thought it was just god awful.  The controls felt so slow and inaccurate that I couldn't get any joy out of it.</p><p>Well, the other day, I read an article on 1up from creator Keiji Inafune, who is also the creator of Megaman and Dead Rising.  When creating the game engine for Dead Rising and Lost Planet, he assembled all of his friends from his glory days in early Capcom history.  All his pals that spent those lonely nights developing Megaman 2 with him were all back developing these 360 titles.</p><p>Being of like mind, they designed both Dead Rising and Lost Planet with Megaman in mind.  After they finished the game engine, the lead developer came to Inafune and said, "my work is done.  we can now bring Megaman to the next generation."</p><p>After hearing this, I was astounded.  This was the main impetus behind developing Lost Planet?  To further refine their next-gen Megaman engine?  Maybe I misjudged this game.</p><p>So.. I set forth to find a copy of Lost Planet and give it a fair shake.  Perhaps I overlooked the love behind the money.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Planet</b></div><p>Lost Planet is about a new planet found by humans to further their exploration in space.  It is a desolate frigid iceberg.  One day while attempting to further their understanding of the planet, Aliens known as the Akrid attack the humans.  "Holy crap!  There's aliens in dem hills"  Humanity gets their ass kicked, but develops mechas known as VS to battle the Akrid.</p><p>Thus, the war between humans and aliens begins.</p><p>You are Wayne.  One of these common workers on the planet, to further mining and expanding the human society on the planet, when a gigantic Akrid attacks and kills off your father.. figure.  When you run away, you're lost in a snow storm in pass out.  Then a girl with huge breasts and a tight outfit despite subzero temperatures finds you, along with this dork and a mysterious scientist.  And you go around and do some missions for them all while finding your purpose in life.</p><p>Typical animu bullshit.  The story is absolutely ridiculous and the plot doesn't make any sense.  For the longest time, you're fighting this organization that wants to terraform the planet, but you keep trying to stop them.  Isn't that the damn point of being on this planet in the first place?!  You want humanity to be able to inhabit this planet.  Why is your goal to prevent this?!</p><p>Eventually you find out that terraforming the planet will kill everything on it.  Well, let's do it.  Light the shit up.  ugh..</p><p>Anyways..  the story really isn't the reason I got the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Gameplay</b></div><p>What's really ironic about this whole experience is the gameplay.  I'm playing this game for the gameplay.  And that is also the most annoying thing about the game.  The annoying story is really only fueled by how annoying the gameplay is, otherwise the story would just be hilariously bad.  Something to jest about.</p><p>Just like my original expression of the gameplay, it is slow, unresponsive and an overall pain in the ass if you want to pull off any sort of precision.  Nearly all bosses require you to fight in a VS, which are incredibly slow.  Jumping takes an extra second to get lift off the ground.  There's no quick movement to dodge away from attacks.  You really have to know the boss strategy and have patience in order to effectively win the game, which doesn't translate in multiplayer at all.</p><p>Pain in the ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>What's worse about this game is the single player is the only thing you can do these days.  No one is playing multiplayer because there's better things out there these days.  Everyone is playing Rainbow 6 Vegas or GRAW.</p><p>360 games are such fads.  The media hypes the shit out of them, and everyone is playing when it first comes out.  But 6 months later, the online rooms are vacant.  360 gamers have moved on to their next overly hyped game and playing that multiplayer.</p><p>Of course, the failure of multiplayer for Lost Planet is partly due to the horrible gameplay.  How are you supposed to get all the multiplayer achievement points when you can't play multiplayer?  Gamers are off playing their new game for achievements, and left this game behind.</p><p>People seem to think that the Wii is a fad, but jesus..  How are 360 fps games not a fad?  Gamers move from one game to the next and retailers only retain the cash difference between the New price and the trade-in price.</p><p>This over-saturation is ridiculous.  Their are too many games out, and too many games coming out to justify paying $60 per game.  Honestly, this only decreases the quality of games and makes them "snack-size" rather than something you can really sink your teeth into.  Even Resident Evil 4 I could really sink my teeth into, but it wasn't enough.  It was a 10 hour game.</p><div class='title'><b>Crap</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost Planet is crap.  I'm through kidding myself that this game is something special.  Unfortunately, Inafune, your gameplay is just too annoying.  I wanted to like this game, but playing it just pisses me off.  You can't even beat the final boss, goddammit.</p><p>Don't buy this game and rent other games instead.  The Single player really isn't worth your time.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock for Sale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale">Schlock for Sale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
