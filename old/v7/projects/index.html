| January 23, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Recently I started thinking about the Dreamcast thanks to a recent playthrough of Crazy Taxi from ADGQ. While many of the games have been released and made available on other consoles and platforms throughout the years, there are still several games orphaned on the Dreamcast. Plus, the authentic feel of the playing the game, and hearing the original sounds and music is often not well replicated elsewhere.</p><p>Because of this, and 8bitmods eventual release of their VMU Memcard Pro, I decided to look into Dreamcast mods to determine what it would take to put together a console capable of playing its vast library via hard drive or sd card, similar to the <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2</a> set up I did last year.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, it does not seem difficult at all. Many moderns mods are parts replacement for internal components. You still need to open up the console and take things apart, but you aren't soldering any mod chips or replacing capacitors. You just unplug this component, remove it, and plug in this one instead. Very plug and play. Many of these parts are pretty cheap through AliExpress too!</p><p>Anyways, I ordered a bunch of parts this week. My Dreamcast is back in the states, so even though the parts will arrive over the next two weeks, assembly will have to wait until after summer.</p><p>In the meantime, I can prepare.</p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast GDemu</b></div><p>The main mod used in the Dreamcast is the <b>GDemu</b>. It is a PCB replacement for the entire GD-ROM reader assembly. To install, you need to take out the GD-ROM disc reader, and put this PCB in there instead. The GDemu board has an SD card reader attached to it, and this is where all of the games are stored.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I bought a SanDisk Extreme 128gb card, Class 10. Game are around 1.2gb each, which I thought would be enough space. But, I'm already getting close to the upper limit of space. A 256gb cards would've been better. I might upgrade later.</p><p>Some people online have complained about compatibility, but I think those complaints predate the current version of GDemu. More recent videos and posts have said similar SD cards work just fine for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Format SD Card</b></div><p>The GDemu requires the SD card to be FAT-32 format. One person said that using 64k byte cluster sizes can help with readability, too, so I opted for that. (It probably doesn't matter.) Using Diskutil, Macs will format FAT-32 with a cluster size of 32k bytes. So, for the 64k byte cluster size, you can use the following terminal commands.</p><p><pre>diskutil unmount SD_IDENTIFIER<br/>sudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -c 128 -v VOLUMEID /dev/SD_IDENTIFIER<br/>diskutil mount SD_IDENTIFIER</pre></p><p>The drive must be unmounted first before formatting it, then the <code>newfs_msdos</code> command is used. <code>VOLUMEID</code> is the new name of your SD card, and <code>SD_IDENTIFIER</code> is the identifier used in disk utils.  Check <code>diskutil list</code> for the correct identifier. <code>-F 32</code> is for FAT-32. <code>-c 128</code> is for the 64 byte cluster size.</p><p>(The reasons for 128 with -c is a little complicated. Overall, we want a 64k byte size. In bytes, this is 64x1024 = 65,536 bytes. The SD card has a block size of 512 bytes, so we do 65,536/512, which is 128. This number describes the number of blocks in a cluster.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, our SD card is in the current format. Now, we need games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>To combat piracy, Sega and Yamaha created a new disc format for the Dreamcast called the GD-ROM. GD-ROMs held up to 1gb of information, surpassing the 650mb limits of the CD-ROM. One unique feature of the GD-ROM was that information was "burned" into the CD from the outside in, rather than inside out, like CD-ROMs. Both of these together were expected to make the Dreamcast secure from people burning their own games.</p><p>Within one year after its North American release, this was circumvented. Even though games were on GD-ROMs, the Dreamcast could still read CD-ROMs, so hacker group Utopia created the infamous Utopia disc which forced the Dreamcast to boot in CD-ROM mode. Games could then be burned to CD-ROMs and run nearly identically to the GD-ROMs. Some stuff had to be cut from games to fit into the 650mb CD limit, but many GD-ROMs filled their discs with dummy information anyways.  Much of this dummy information was just pushing the data to the outer edge of the disc.</p><p>Because of this, Dreamcast games can be found online in two main formats: GDI and CDI files. GDI is usually preferred as the CDI version could have cut content to fit into 650mb. Although, the problem with GDI files is that they are always 1.1gb or 1.2gb to simulate the full size of the disc. It's possible to shrink these sizes, cutting out the extra content, but that can still cause some compatibility issues.</p><div class='title'><b>Game Management</b></div><p>Games are copied to the SD card, but the GDemu requires a specific file and folder structure. You also need files for the GD Menu, too.</p><p>I found this amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4">YouTube video</a> from Derek Pascarella fully describing the software-wide of how to set up and manage games for your Dreamcast using the GDemu. Here's that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4">link</a> again. The rest of this post is basically going to parrot this video.</p><p>You will need to download 2 things for Games and Menu management. And there's one more thing to download to edit Boxart and Metadata for games in the menu.</p><p>1) The <a href="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager" title="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager">GD Menu Card Manager</a> is how you will manage all your games<br/>2) <a href="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu" title="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu">Open Menu</a> is the most modern menu used in the Dreamcast to choose your games.<br/>3) The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> for editing boxart and metadata.</p><p>The Open Menu DAT Tool is available through the dreamcast-talk forum, which is member only and a little difficult to gain access. The video has a link to their personal Google Drive for the file. The link above connects to my Google Drive, where I also have a copy.</p><div class='title'><b>GD Menu Card Manager</b></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager" title="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager">GD Menu Card Manager</a> works for both Mac and PC. When you open the program, choose your SD card from the menu. You can choose whether to install GDmenu or Open Menu. Any game you want install, just drag into the window, rename to whatever you want, and hit Save Changes at the bottom.</p><p>Overall, the GDemu wants each disc in its own folder, numbered starting from 01. The 01 folder is special and it must contain the GDemu menu (GDmenu or openMenu). The Card Manager will copy the correct files for you. From 02, each folder is for a game disc. Again, the Card Manager will manage all these folders for you. When adding new games, you can have them alphabetically sorted, and the Manager will rearrange everything for you.</p><p>Some options are missing in the Mac version of the Card Manager. I'm not able to shrink the GDI files for some reason. This is probably using something only available on PC. However, as the video mentions, shrinking GDI files is not a one-size-fits-all hammer solution. For full compatibility, it's best not to shrink.</p><div class='title'><b>Game Serial Numbers</b></div><p>Much like Playstation games, Dreamcast games each have a unique identifier. All retail games do this, but hacks, ports, and other self-published indie titles sometimes don't. For example, the Dreamcast port of Divi-Dead and Grand Theft Auto III share the same serial number when added to the card manager, T00001.</p><p>Just like the game title, you can freely edit serial numbers to whatever you like.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I changed Grand Theft Auto III's serial number to TGTA3. The only thing this disrupts is the boxart and metadata used for Open Menu, and we can fix that.</p><div class='title'><b>Open Menu</b></div><p>When the Menu Card Manager saves changes to the SD card, it copies all the menu information it has locally to the SD card. On PC, all of its dlls and subfolders are clearly visible. The openMenu files are stored in the following location: <code>tools/openMenu/menu_data</code>. This is true for the Mac version, too, but all the files are hidden inside of the app. Click on the GDMENUCardManager.app file and "Show Package Contents." From there, the openMenu files are located here: <code>Contents/MacOS/tools/openMenu/menu_data</code></p><p>By default, there's not much there, but that's where there <a href="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu" title="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu">Open Menu</a> download comes in. Unzip the latest release and copy all of the contents of <code>menu_data</code> into the above location. Click on Save Changes in the Menu Manager, and your openMenu is completely up to date.</p><div class='title'><b>Boxart and Metadata Changes</b></div><p>Among the Open Menu files we copied to the GD Menu app were 3 DAT files, <code>BOX.DAT</code>, <code>ICON.DAT</code>, and <code>META.DAT</code>. These are file databases which house boxart, game icon, and metadata for all the Dreamcast games. It has all retail games, indie games, and most other ports and hacks. But, it doesn't have everything. And if you changed any serial numbers, it definitely doesn't have those games.</p><p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> will allow you to edit them. You can add new images (PNG format only) and create the menu icon from that. You can add and edit any metadata for games, too.</p><p>Save all the changes back to the DAT files for the Card Manager. And then "Save Changes" in the Card Manager to apply the changes to the SD card.</p><div class='title'><b>Preparation Complete</b></div><p>For the time being, my preparations are complete. I have loaded my SD card with over 100 discs. You can take a look at what I have available by viewing my <a href="/old/v7/modded-console-game-inventory" title="/modded-console-game-inventory">Game Inventory</a>.</p><p>I'll start getting the physical mods in the mail over the next few weeks. Then after summer vacation, I should have my Dreamcast available to install the mods.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Digital Retro Game Library" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/digital-retro-game-library">Digital Retro Game Library</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 25, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My retro gaming hardware collection has grown recently. The Analogue Pocket introduced me into a gaming platform possible of playing decades of games across dozens of consoles, handhelds, and arcade boards. Recently, I got a Mister which expanded this reach even further.</p><p>Last year, I made a <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">page</a> that catalogued all of the notable games I had on my Analogue Pocket. And now I've revamped that curated list into an overall Digital Retro Game Library. This lists all the notable games I have available on both the Pocket and the Mister. More platforms may be added in the future, like PS2 and Gamecube.</p><p><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><b>Digital Retro Game Library</b></a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playlists</b></div><p>Originally, these games were being collected to build Genre lists of games using the now-canceled Playlist feature for the Analogue Pocket. The idea was that I could scroll through a Genre of games and choose one to play without having to pay attention to the hardware platform it was designed for. I was collecting all this information using <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-utils" title="/analogue-pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a>, a collection of Java programs that I wrote to manage games and stuff on my Pocket.</p><p>Later, after the Playlist feature was buried and gone, I decided to put all of this information into a webpage so I could at least see everything visually. This was the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">Pocket Curated Games</a> page, the first iteration of this project.</p><p>Later again and recently, I got a Mister. The Mister is the premiere FPGA gaming platform, and the Analogue Pocket is a handheld FPGA device. FPGA cores are written for specific hardware, so there are advantages to both platforms, although the Mister can generally handle more complicated systems and it's open source. Because of this, people have built several features and accessories on top of the platform. One thing implemented a couple years ago was Shortcuts. Rather than turning on a core and choosing a game, you could choose a game directly from the main menu. This is exactly like how I wanted Playlists to work on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>So, by updating the programs in Pocket Utils to look for Mister games, I could add all that information in the database. And writing a new program, I could automatically make shortcuts to all the games I have managed in my database, essentially creating all the Playlists I wanted from the beginning.</p><p>The Pocket Curated Page being revamped into the Digital Retro Game Library now shows all those games, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Launching Games</b></div><p>There's another really nice feature available on the Mister called TapTo. TapTo is a service that runs in the background on Mister and accepts game executing commands. The main idea for this feature was to bring back physicality to the Mister, which is a sole digital platform. Using a physical NFC reader you can "tap" a physical NFC card (or anything with an NFC signal) and it will automatically launch the game associated with it.</p><p>I'm not interested in having a huge collection of cards for individual games. But, I was very interested in TapTo's feature of launching RANDOM games. By sorting all of my shortcuts to games in Genre folders, I could launch a random Shooter or random Fighter.</p><p>Earlier this year, the TapTo service was upgraded to accept network requests. Any device connected to the same Wifi network could send a command to TapTo and it'll execute it. They launched a phone app that took advantage of this, but the request service is wide open. Anything can send commands.</p><p>So, combining yet another project with this, I added functionality in my chat bot, <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a>, to accept requests to launch random games from my Genres. With Pocket Utils updated to manage my Mister games, Schlock Bot can read this information too, and launch individual games.</p><p><pre>!game Shooter<br/>!game Panzer Dragoon (Saturn)</pre></p><p>These commands can be typed in my Discord and read by Schlock Bot.</p><div class='title'><b>Going Further</b></div><p>One annoying thing about typing in games to launch in Discord is that you have to type them correctly. Dr. Mario has a period in it, so if you type Dr Mario, it won't find the game. Also, I have a Gameboy Color version of Dr. Mario, too, so which one do you want? You need to be annoyingly specific.</p><p>So, using the Digital Game Library, you can click on a game, it'll write that execution command in Discord, Schlock Bot will read the command (if it's running), and then launch the game on Mister (if that's running too).</p><p>As such, the Digital Retro Game Library not only shows all my available games, but it's also a method of selecting games to play on the Mister.</p><p>There's a lot of moving parts in between clicking a game and it launching on the Mister. It would be a lot better if the webpage sent the request to Schlock Bot directly. But, this janky thing works for the time being. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Additions</b></div><p>Getting back to the Library, prior to getting a Mister, I set up a Playstation 2 with a game server to play all of those classic games. I made an <a href="/old/v7/playstation-2-game-inventory" title="/playstation-2-game-inventory">inventory</a> page that shows all of those games, but I'm thinking about adding them in this library, too. Also, I may mod a gamecube in the future to play a library of those games. I will want to have a library of those games listed somewhere, so adding them here or on the PS2 inventory page makes sense.</p><p>In addition to more games, I was thinking of putting download links to my save files for each game, too. I'm already doing this on the PS2 Game Inventory page with memory cards.</p><p>We'll see. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MemCard Pro2 for Playstation 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">MemCard Pro2 for Playstation 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 17, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Late last year, English gaming company 8bitmods released a device called the <b>MemCard Pro 2</b>. It is advertised as "the last memory card you'll ever need." It works for both Playstation 1 and Playstation 2, and it stores all of its data for memory on an SD card. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After putting together my <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2 set up</a>, I wanted some way of being able to backup all of my save data from my decade of playing the Playstation 1 and 2. Having a memory card that uses an SD card was what I wanted, and I found this.</p><p>But, it does MUCH more than just store save files on an SD card. It has a paging system, so you can easily create a new card with the press of a button. It identifies games with Game Id, so it can create unique memory cards for each game. And the card has Wifi, so all of its functions can be controlled by a web interface!</p><div class='title'><b>Updating</b></div><p>Before doing anything, you need an SD card. Each PS2 memory card is 8mb so even having an SD card with 128gb of space is massive over kill. I bought a 64gb Samsung card for around $10 since it seemed to be the cheapest option. 32gb cards were available, but they were around the same price. May as well get a slightly large one. The SD card must be formatted either FAT32 or ExFat. I went with ExFat.</p><p>With the card ready to go, the next necessary step is firmware. You should update to the most recent version for access to all of the current features. Here's the link to the firmware:<br/><a href="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public" title="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public">Latest Firmware Download</a></p><p>Put the SD card in the MemCard and put the MemCard in the PS2. Power it on, and it'll start updating. When finished, it is ready to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Wi-Fi</b></div><p>You may think that Wi-Fi is unnecessary for a memory card, but you have so many more methods of control than being limited to the 2-button, small screen interface attached to the PS2. When you want to change card, you can easily do it with a scroll and a click in a web browser.</p><p>Setting up the Wi-Fi has a few steps that are pretty easy. First, you need to hold down the Left button and release to enter the Menu. Click down to Wi-Fi and select it. You'll be given an IP address. Now, the memcard pro is broadcasting as an access point. It wants you to connect to the access point and visit the webpage at that IP address. Going to that IP address will open a webpage to complete the Wi-Fi set up.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In the Setup Wizard, you'll choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to.

Any device that is on your network can navigate to that IP address in a browser and be able to manage the data and settings on the Memcard Pro.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>From the Browser you can easily select which memory card should be used and quickly change cards, too. You can further set up which memory card should be selected by default when the console powers up. And, you can set up cloud backup with Google Drive. You can also update the firmware from here, too, rather than doing it manually.</p><div class='title'><b>Save Management</b></div><p>One of the best features of the Memcard is identifying games using Game_Id. Every disc printed and created for a Playstation 1 and 2 has a unique Game_Id associated with it and the Memcard can identify this ID and automatically create or switch to a virtual memory card used only for that game. It does this by default, but you can change this behavior in the settings.</p><p>That means that you don't need to worry about trying to find which cards have which saves. You also don't have to worry about space on a card because other games won't be there to fill the space. And, even if you do save a lot in one game and use up all of the space, you can create a new page and have up to 8 memory cards for each game.</p><p>All memory cards are stored as virtual drives in the <code>mcd</code> format on the SD card. Unfortunately, you can't modify the contents of the card directly on a PC. So, if you want to add stuff on the card directly, you still need to use uLaunchELF on the PS2.</p><p>There might be something out there that will mount of the drive and give you access because people have written scripts and programs that access the contents of the cards for Save Splitting. But, I haven't found anything yet. Save Splitting is useful when moving the contents of your current memory card stash into the Memcard.</p><div class='title'><b>Transferring Old Memory Cards</b></div><p>I have an old plastic bag full of memory cards from the late 90s and 2000s. The bulk of these are Playstation 1 cards, but there are some Playstation 2 cards, too. As well as Dreamcast, N64, and Gamecube.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In total, I have eleven Playstation 1 cards, a Pocketstation, and six Playstation 2 cards. I want to move all of this data onto my SD card. It'd be nice if the Memcard Pro2 had an option to copy a Memory Card directly, but we have to copy over everything manually. From there, we have to use Save Splitting programs to separate and sort all of the saves into their own memory cards.</p><p>Overall, this is a 2-step process for both Playstation 1 and 2, and the first step is identical for both: we need to manually transfer all Memory Card saves from one memory card to another. This is normally done using the Playstation browser, and I think it's the fastest method for Playstation 1. But for Playstation 2, it's much faster to use uLaunchELF and move all of the file contents.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>With uLaunchELF, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card is slot 1, and <code>mc1</code> is slot 2. Mark everything you want to copy with the X button, hit R1 for the menu, and select copy. Navigate to the other memory card location, hit R1 for the menu again, and select paste. Everything you selected will be copied. uLaunchELF didn't refresh when I unplugged and changed memory cards, so I had to restart uLaunchELF each time.  It's still MUCH faster than loading PS2 saves in the Browser, though.</p><p>With all the cards copied as Virtual memory cards, we want to break out all the saves into all of their unique cards for each game.</p><p>All of the save splitting stuff I learned from <b>Archades Games</b> on YouTube. He has a ton of tutorials for retro gaming setups, and I followed his videos quite closely whenever I had problems.<br/>For PS2 saves: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0</a><br/>For PS1 saves: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0</a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2 Save Splitting</b></div><p>For PS2 saves, Archades' video pointed to a dev named K3zter. He has created a save splitter script, and it's available here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/K3zter/mcp2-save-splitter" title="https://github.com/K3zter/mcp2-save-splitter">https://github.com/K3zter/mcp2-save-splitter</a></p><p>There are instructions on the page, but in order to use this, you want to download the entire contents of this repository and place them into a folder on your computer.  The script relies on program called <code>mymc</code> created by another developer, gastroman. As the description says, you can download that program here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/">sourceforget/mymc</a>. All contents of mymc distribution should be placed in the <code>mymc</code> folder.</p><p>The save-splitter distribution has an <code>import</code> and an <code>export</code> folder. Pretty self-explanatory. Put all your saves in the import folder, run the script, and all of the split saves will be in the export folder. </p><p>The script is run from a PowerShell instance and you need to Run it as an Administrator, since it'll be moving and editing files. Once opened, navigate to the script's location, and execute the script by typing:</p><p><pre>.\split.ps1</pre></p><p>The script may not run at first because Windows doesn't want you to run scripts that change the contents of your computer without you understanding what you're actually doing. Archades' video points to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10635/why-are-my-powershell-scripts-not-running" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10635/why-are-my-powershell-scripts-not-running">Stack Overflow</a> question asking how to get around this.

Because of this, we need to add a bunch of arguments to the execution code. You also need to make your own export folder. In the same folder with the program, I made a folder called <code>export</code>. I also made an <code>import</code> folder, but it's not necessary. For the command line, you'll need to type in this:</p><p><pre>memcardpro split export import/MemoryCard?-?.mcd</pre></p><p>Be sure to change the question marks in that command to the actual filename.

But, you can't run uLaunchELF unless you already have a memory card with Free McBoot.

It's a device created from a community standard that converts analog video signals into digital signals, primarily for retro video game consoles. It has 3 inputs, SCART, component, and VGA, and will output HDMI. I'm primary using this with a Playstation 2, but the Analogue Pocket's Analogizer is also hooked up to it. I recently got mine from AliExpress for $90. Then I bought an acrylic outer case for $20.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The era of the Playstation 2 was the last video game generation to use analog video signals as a standard. Starting with the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, consoles natively supported HDMI, and now its standard on absolutely everything. Prior to HDMI, RCA composite cables were standard in North America and Japan, while SCART was standard in Europe. But, for North America, the highest quality video you could get used RGB composite cables.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2 Component Cables</b></div><p>For the Playstation 2, the official component cables are one of the best options. But the actual official ones are hard to find and usually expensive. Also, there are many bootlegs cables being sold as official. Signal integrity is very important to analog video, so cheap cables can eat away at the quality. So, the actual best PS2 video cables on the market are the cables from Retrovision.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think they look cheap on the outside, but the internals are not. The inner components are perfectly shielded and expertly crafted to ensure the highest quality, strongest signal possible from source to destination. They were $30 on Amazon, not too much more expensive than others.</p><div class='title'><b>Signals and Resolutions</b></div><p>For the most part, by default, the Playstation 2 outputs a 480i resolution. In general, this is a 640x480 resolution drawn with interlacing. I'm not an expert, but I have come to understand that interlacing draws the video with overlapping alternating lines. A complete single frame is split into two images alternatingly drawn on top of each other, which creates two frames instead one.</p><p>Modern TVs with HDMI use progressive scan to draw the image on a TV. A single frame is drawn from top to bottom in order without alternating lines. Some Playstation 2 games have the option of output 480p, where p stands for progressive. The OSSC loves a 480p signal because, even though it is being passed as an analog signal, it's in a digital format, and that's what modern TVs want.</p><p>The 480i signal is more annoying. The OSSC needs to convert the interlaced signals into progressive, and it uses bob deinterlacing to do this. Bob deinterlacing takes the half-drawn image from the first frame and treats it as progressive. It's only 240 tall, so it doubles the height. Then it does the same with the next frame, the other half of the image. Another name for this technique is line doubling.</p><p>So, we want to set up the OSSC to handle <b>480p</b> and <b>480i</b> signals.</p><p>People have made a list of all Playstation 2 games that support 480p (and other resolutions) and how to enable it.<br/><a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes" title="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes">https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes</a></p><div class='title'><b>480p Signals</b></div><p>Overall, if a game supports 480p (or any progressive scan format), we want to use it. Using OPL, there's a way to force this. GSM, or <b>Graphics Synthesizer Mode Selector</b>, is another unofficial PS2 app that works with OPL. When choosing a game in OPL, you can hit <code>triangle</code> to enter the Game Settings menu. Then enter the GSM Settings menu. For 480p available games, enable GSM and switch the "Mode" to 480p.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Be sure to save the Game Settings! Now, when you launch the game, it will automatically run in 480p.</p><div class='title'><b>OSSC Settings</b></div><p><b>Note:</b> I'm still trying to find the best settings.

In those recent years, no home console had been backwards compatible with its predecessor, mainly because of cartridges. So having a new console being able to play your current game library was a massive boost.</p><p>This was accomplished by including the original Playstation hardware inside of the Playstation 2. Over time, this extra hardware was shrunk, and eventually relegated to software emulation, which wasn't perfect.</p><p>Anyways, with getting OPL and a Games server working for the Playstation 2, I wanted Playstation 1 working in the same way. The overall process for Playstation 1 games is similar to Playstation 2 games, but the steps are different.</p><p>Here is my set up for the Playstation 2 with OPL, the file server, and everything else:<br/><a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">/returning-to-the-playstation-2</a></p><div class='title'><b>POPStarter</b></div><p>Even though the Playstation 2 has the Playstation 1 hardware for games, the games will be run in software. Unfortunately, there's no way around this. <b>POPS</b> is Sony's Playstation 1 emulator that runs on the ps2, and OPL's method of using this is called POPStarter. It stands for Playstation One Portable Station, probably.</p><p><b>Note</b>: There are two ways of setting up Playstation 1 games and POPstarter using OPL and I'm using the old way. This way is only compatible using OPL Anniversary Edition. The latest versions of OPL have removed this method of execution for a newer method which has a slightly better success rate for compatibility. I'm not sure if it works through SMB, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, my Playstation 2 setup is streaming games through the ethernet port using an SMB server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. I need to add POPStarter configuration on my memory card with Free McBoot. And then, there are some additional files required for the file server along with the games.</p><div class='title'><b>POPSTARTER Configuration for the Memory Card</b></div><p>Because I'm running Playstation 1 games from the SMB File Share, I needed to download a specific POPStarter setup for the memory card. I downloaded <b>POPSTARTER.zip</b> found on the following page: <br/><a href="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/">https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/</a></p><p>When unzipped it will give a <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder. This entire folder will be copied to the Free McBoot memory card, but we need to change two things first.</p><p>First, we need to change the <code>IPCONFIG.DAT</code> file. This contains the ip details of the PS2. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PS2-IP-ADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAY</pre></p><p>These details are all found in the Network Settings of OPL. The PS2-IP-ADDRESS is the IP address of the PS2 on the network. The Netmask is the same one in OPL. And the Gateway is the IP address of the File server. All of these are listed in OPL's Network Config menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Note</b>: Originally, my Playstation 2 IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>. POPS does not like it when the IPs of the Playstation 2 and the File Server are on different subnets, so I changed the PS2's IP address in OPL to <code>192.168.2.10</code>. This solved my problem.</p><p>Here is my completed file:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1</pre></p><p>Next, we need to change <code>SMBCONFIG.DAT</code>. This tells popstarter where the files are located on the network. OPL knows where the files are, but it doesn't tell POPS this information when it launches, so we need to add this information here. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PC-IP-ADDRESS PS2SMB<br/>username<br/>password</pre></p><p>There's the server's IP address, the server's folder name, and the login details. I'm using the SMB Share setup on the Raspberry Pi, so here are my details:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.1 share</pre></p><p>There are no login details, so those lines are omitted. The share on the Pi is just <code>share</code>, and it's running on that IP.</p><div class='title'><b>Memory Card Installation</b></div><p>The <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder and all of its contents will be copied to the Memory Card with Free McBoot. To do this, we'll need to put all these files on a simple USB Drive and plug that directly into a USB slot of the PS2.</p><p>After turning on the PS2 with Free McBoot, you'll need to open uLaunchELF, which is a file browser for the Playstation 2. The drive marked <code>mass</code> is your USB drive, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card in the first slot, and <code>mc1</code> is the memory card in the second slot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In <code>mass</code>, select (mark) your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder, hit <code>R1</code> to pull up the menu, and select copy. Navigate to <code>mc0</code> for your Free McBoot card, hit <code>R1</code> again, and select paste. This will copy your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder to the memory card.</p><p>Your memory card setup is complete.</p><div class='title'><b>File Server Files</b></div><p>On the file server, Playstation 1 games are put in the <code>POPS</code> folder, but we need another file for the emulator to work, the emulator itself! The file for the actual emulator is named <code>POPS_IOX.PAK</code>. It's not too difficult to find through a Google search, but this file contains copyrighted information by Sony, so search at your own risk. </p><p>This last file we're going to need is <code>POPSTARTER.ELF</code>. ELF files are applications that run on the Playstation 2, and this is POPStarter application that runs the emulator. When you select a game in OPL, it will open that game with this application.</p><p>With everything set up, now we need some games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>POPStarter and OPL requires Playstation 1 Games in the VCD format and using the same filename format as PS2 games. When you illegally download any Playstation 1 game, it'll most likely be in the bin/cue format. So, you'll need to convert them.</p><p>The best program to do this with is called <b>PFS BatchKit Manager</b>. It can be found on GitHub here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager" title="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager">https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager</a></p><p>PFS BatchKit Manager is a command line program for Windows, so Windows might complain when you try to open it. It should run within your OPL folder on your File server. Conversions are found under the Advanced Menu. Follow this route:</p><p><pre> -> 10. Advanced Menu<br/> -> 1. Conversion<br/> -> 1. Convert .bin to .vcd</pre></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It will search the <code>POPS</code> folder for any bin/cue files, and process them. First, it'll combine all the bin files into a single bin file. Then it will convert to vcd. PFS BatchKit Manager will also rename your files with the Disc ID in the front and with the correct game name from their database.</p><p>I've had the process fail once or twice on large batches of files, so I always convert a few at a time. It can sometimes take a while, too, so I prefer going bit by bit.</p><p>This will complete the process for single disc games. You can open OPL Manager to double check the file names are correct.</p><div class='title'><b>Multi-Disc Games</b></div><p>For games with multiple discs, there is one more step to complete.</p><p>POPStarter doesn't read the PS2's memory card, so it will create a virtual memory card for saving.

| June 19, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lately I have revisited the Playstation 2, my favorite console of all time. I played the PS2 for hours and hours during college, made some amazing friends through playing games, and have amazing memories of those times. So, I wanted to relive those memories as well as return to a time when video games began evolving into something with more complexity, both for story and gameplay.</p><p>I wanted to return to the PS2 in the same way I've come back to other retro consoles thanks to the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket" title="/analogue-pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. I wanted to have a significant library of games that could easily be stored and sifted through digitally, as well as having them look their best on a modern TV. The PS2 is also backwards compatible with Playstation 1 games, so I wanted to be able to play those too. After messing around with things for about a month, I finally have everything set up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The overall set up isn't too complicated, but it has a bunch of parts required for everything to work together. To quickly explain, I'm using a memory card with Free McBoot on an original Playstation 2 slim to run Open PS2 Loader. I have a Raspberry Pi acting a network file server that OPL is connecting to in order to load games. I have a 4tb hard drive connected to the Raspberry Pi where all of the games are stored. And, the PS2 is using component video cables connected to an OSSC to digitize the video and send it to my modern TV.</p><p>All of this was inspired by another one of Tito's YouTube videos: <br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8</a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2</b></div><p>At the center of the entire set up is an actual Playstation 2. None of this entire process modifies the original console whatsoever. Everything extra can be unplugged from the Playstation 2, and it'll be the same as it was 20 years ago.</p><p>My original Playstation 2 Slim is 10,000km away back in the United States, so I bought a Japanese Slim from Yahoo Auctions. For the best possible compatibility, people had recommended the original Slim release, so I bought a SCPH-70000 model. It was really cheap at only 3000yen, and it came with the vertical stand and a few games.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In later revisions of the Playstation Slim, they moved Playstation 1 processing into software rather than hardware. They also removed legacy hard drive support, which isn't even available for the Slim.</p><div class='title'><b>Free McBoot Memory Card</b></div><p>In order for any of this to work, we need access to the Playstation 2's file system and be able to run unofficial applications. In particular, we need to be able to run <b>Open PS2 Loader</b>. Creating your own Free McBoot memory card from complete scratch has a lot of steps, but these days, you can easily buy a pre-built Free McBoot memory card from Amazon. I bought one from Amazon JP for only 1500yen.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Official Playstation 2 memory cards have the Magic Gate branding on them, which acts like a Seal of Approval ensuring that all games are compatible with it. This card doesn't have such approval and it's also 64mb compared to the official 8mb limit. Because of this, some games don't like it. We Love Katamari in particular has some saving problems.</p><p>One really nice thing about this card is that it came with absolutely everything installed on it. It already had OPL, all of the retro game emulators, and other necessary applications.</p><div class='title'><b>MemCard Pro2</b></div><p>Going one step further, 8bitmods released a device called the MemCard Pro2, which they restocked a month or two after my initial setup was complete. It is advertised as the "the last memory card you'll ever need," and with this, I no longer need a dedicated memory card with Free McBoot. Although, having an extra card with Free McBoot is handy when moving files around from Memory Card to Memory Card.</p><p>All of the details for the Memcard Pro2 are discussed in another post: <a href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">/memcard-pro2-for-ps2</a></p><div class='title'><b>Raspberry Pi 3 w/ SMB Share</b></div><p>While the hardware center is the Playstation 2 itself, the software center is the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi acts as a File Server and it is directly connected to the PS2 using an ethernet cable. </p><p>I didn't own a Raspberry Pi, so I went to Yahoo Auctions again to find a cheap one. I found a Raspberry Pi 3 with heatsinks installed and an AC adapter for 4000yen. Good deal!  Later, I bought an acrylic case with a fan for only $4 from AliExpress. Also, I had an extra LCD Monitor and a extra keyboard, so I'm using those with it, too.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In order to set up the SMB Share, you need to flash an SD card with the Playstation SMB Share. This image is found here: <a href="https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare" title="https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare">https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare</a>. I used a program called balenaEtcher to put this image on one of my extra micro SD cards.</p><p>On the initial power-up, it takes a little time to do some set-up, but eventually you'll be given a log in prompt. This happens every time the Raspberry Pi boots up. The default username is <code>pi</code> and the default password is <code>raspberry</code>. With everything set up, you'll need IP information for OPL's connection. Type in <code>ifconfig</code> and you'll be given the network data.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" /></a></p><p><pre>inet 192.168.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255</pre></p><p>This is the line that we care about. The Pi's IP address is <code>192.168.2.1</code>. To turn off the Raspberry Pi, type <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code>. It will shutdown, but then you'll need to unplug it. There's no actual on/off switch.</p><p><b>Note:</b> the Raspberry Pi doesn't like to plug and play. Anything you have plugged in on start up, it will auto mount, but if you plug in something after it has already been turned on, you need to manually mount the device, whether it's a keyboard, a monitor, or a usb drive. Plug in everything before you give it power for best results.</p><div class='title'><b>USB Drive</b></div><p>The SMB Server expects a USB device plugged in the Raspberry Pi to serve files from, and the device must be formatted exFat. </p><p>Every one recommends to use a USB Flash Drive, but standard USB Flash Drives aren't able to scale. They're fine if you want to have a couple of games, but I want to have a large library of games. Modern USB hard drives are pretty big. In fact, I have a few 5tb SSD drives for backing up files. But these are powered through USB. The Raspberry Pi uses a measly amount of power so it can't power anything through USB.</p><p>I had an older 4tb Western Digital hard drive with an actual hard disk, not a solid state or a flash drive. This drive has its own power connection separate from USB. By plugging this in and turning it on before powering on the Raspberry Pi, it works just like any other USB storage device. </p><div class='title'><b>Games and OPL Manager</b></div><p>The physical chain between the Playstation 2 and the games is complete, but there are two more steps. First off, we need some games. You can illegally download games for several different places online. These files come in two different flavors: ISOs and bin/cue files. </p><p><b>Open PS2 Loader</b> is the UI application used on the Playstation 2 to select and run these files, so they need to be in a particular format and have a particular file naming scheme. The USB Drive also needs to be in a particular file structure for OPL to find the games.</p><p><b>OPL Manager</b> is a PC program that will do all of this for us. You can download it <a href="https://oplmanager.com/site/" title="https://oplmanager.com/site/">here</a> or just search on Google if the location changed.</p><p>When OPL Manager first starts, it will ask for a base location. For me, I use a temp location on my USB drive for a few reasons. (One) OPL Manager can take a while to load if there are a lot of games at the location. So, when using a temp location it only needs to load the few games I'm working with at the time. Likewise, these games take up a LOT of space, so (Two) I don't want to process them locally and copy them later. This takes up a lot of space on my local computer, and takes time copying to the hard drive later. I want to work with everything on the drive, and move files around on the drive after.</p><p>Once a base location is selected, it will create all of the folders OPL requires. PS2 games will primarily go in the <code>DVD</code> folder. The <code>CD</code> folder is also for PS2 games that use CD format rather than DVD. This only matters when a game uses other tracks on the disk for audio. I don't think any PS2 game does this. All notable and modern games have their music baked into the game code, so the <code>CD</code> folder can be ignored.</p><p>There are a few other interesting folders, particular <code>THM</code>, <code>ART</code>, and <code>CFG</code>. For a further description of these folders, please read my full OPL load out post: <a href="/old/v7/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="/opl-theme-and-loadout">/opl-theme-and-loadout</a></p><p>OPL only wants games in the ISO format, so you need to convert CD/Bin games to ISO. OPL Manager can do this. Choose <code>Disc/Convert to ISO</code> under Tools, and select files from there.</p><p>Also, OPL wants a particular file format. OPL Manager will mark all the illegal filenames for you and ask you to change them. File names should start with the game's disc id, should not contain certain invalid characters, and should also not be longer than 31 characters. OPL Manager will help you make sure all of this stuff is correct.</p><p>Once all of the games are converted, I copy them into the main location and they are ready.</p><div class='title'><b>Open PS2 Loader</b></div><p>With the games ready, it's time for the Playstation 2 to find them. The USB Drive is plugged into the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is turned on and the server is running. Now, the Playstation 2 can be turned on. With the Free McBoot memory card also plugged in, Open PS2 Loader, or OPL is available from the menu. Select it, and OPL will open.</p><p>When it first boots up, there will be no games. There's a few things OPL does by default that we'll change later, but the first thing we'll need to do is configure the Network Settings so OPL can find the file server.</p><p>Hit <code>start</code> to bring up OPL settings, go to Network Config, and here is where we will enter the IP information from the Raspberry Pi we received from several steps before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the SMB Server, the PI's IP address was <code>192.168.2.1</code>, and the "Share" folder's name is <code>share</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Originally, my PS2's IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>, but I changed it to <code>192.168.2.10</code> to have the same LAN address as the Raspberry Pi. It's not necessary for OPL to work, but it is necessary for POPS to work with Playstation 1 games. Please read the <a href="/old/v7/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl">POPS</a> post for more details.</p><p>Overall, OPL will serve PS2 games from 3 locations: the USB drive, the hard drive, and the ethernet port. By default, it won't automatically connect to these locations. You need to hit the Circle button to connect manually. Also, the hard drive is selected by default. All of this can be changed in the OPL Setting menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By default, I am displaying the Ethernet games on Start Up. Since we're not using the USB Drive and Hard Drive for games, nor are we using any Applications, I disable all 3 of these options in the menu. And for both Ethernet games and Playstation games, I have OPL connecting to these sources automatically on start up.  Now, when OPL opens all of my Playstation 2 games will be shown immediately.</p><p><b>Note:</b> I'm using OPL Anniversary Edition which has Playstation as a menu display. The latest versions of OPL have removed the Playstation menu and force everything to be run from the Applications menu for better compatibility.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 1 Games</b></div><p>We can also run Playstation 1 games using OPL. As mentioned above, this is only available through OPL Anniversary Edition as a separate menu. I have detailed that process in a different post:<br/><a href="/old/v7/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl">/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl</a></p><div class='title'><b>OPL Themes and Metadata</b></div><p>OPL allows you to customize its appearance with an overall theme. You can also have artwork and metadata for all of the games. I put all of these details in a different post:<br/><a href="/old/v7/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="/opl-theme-and-loadout">/opl-theme-and-loadout</a></p><div class='title'><b>Video Conversion and the OSSC</b></div><p>There is one final link in this entire PS2 chain, and that is the video output. The video game generation of the Playstation 2 was the final generation to output analog video by default. HDMI became the standard for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and now everything is HDMI. Without any additional modification, Component video is the highest quality available for the PS2. I'm using the Retrovision Component cables for the PS2, which are apparently the absolute best.</p><p>Analog video must be converted to digital, and that's where I'm using the OSSC.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The OSSC isn't too difficult to get working, but it can send you down a rabbit hole of optimization headaches.

Using original hardware, the best way to do this is using  OPL.</p><p><b>Open PS2 Loader</b>, or OPL, is an interface installed on a PS2 memory card using Free McBoot OS. Through OPL, you can view all games you have installed on a USB drive, hard drive, or on a network share. After a bit of trial and error, I have a tons of a games on a 4tb hard drive hosted on a network share from a Raspberry Pi.</p><p>I have loaded this hard drive with every or any game I've ever remotely wanted to play, and the list has grown far greater than I imaged it would. To keep track of everything, I put all the entries in a database. And because OPL uses box art and metadata, I wanted an easy way to view it all.</p><p>So, I made another Game Inventory page, and this shows all of the Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games currently stored on my hard drive.</p><p><i><b>UPDATE - January 23rd, 2025</b></i>: The PS2 Game Inventory has expanded to include Dreamcast and Gamecube games. Probably more in the future, too.

| September 26, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I have updated my the codebase for my Raid Counter lists in Pokemon Go. Overall, the calculation method are still based on Gamepress's <a href="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet" title="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet">Comprehensive DPS Spreadsheet</a>, but now I'm pulling my data from Poke_Miner's <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters">Game Master</a> file, and also updated the UI to be more visually appealing and understandable.</p><p class='img'><p class="img"><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter"><b>List of General Raid Counters</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" /></a></p></p><p>In addition, there are two others pages. </p><p><b><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom">Personal Raid Counter List</a></b> —  I made a page that uses Pokemon in my game to determine whether or not I can defeat the raid boss using just my two accounts. It's not up to date. </p><p><b><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top">Top Counters per Pokemon Type</a></b> —  Another page compares Pokemon of each type against a generic Arceus to see which is strongest within each type, and overall. It's up to date, but I haven't focused on readability.</p><div class='title'><b>Purpose</b></div><p>The purpose of these pages is to determine which Pokemon are the strongest against Pokemon that appear as raid bosses. It's very helpful to understand which Pokemon are worth catching and leveling to take down these bosses easily. While they almost always can't be defeated with just one person, every bit helps to defeat them with the fewest amount of people as you can.</p><p>Many sites that focus of Pokemon Go offer lists of the best pokemon, but never with enough detail to understand why they're the best and never on a single page with all bosses available in the game. Gamepress's DPS page is a great resource to see how much more powerful one pokemon is than another, but you have to manually search and filter everything.</p><p>Back in 2019, I first made this page. At the time, it was use the outputted data from Gamepress to create the page. Whenever there was an update, it would take a LOONGG time to redownload everything. So, last year, I rewrote the backend to do all the calculations itself using the same method as Gamepress. There's more information about here on the previous Project post: <b><a href="/old/v7/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old" title="/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old">Previous Post from 2022</a></b></p><div class='title'><b>Update</b></div><p>I liked my previous page, but it was unreadable to anyone else. Also, Gamepress almost never updates its backend data, which my page relied on.</p><p>As mentioned above, this update does two things.</p><p>First, I'm using Poke_Miner's <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters">Game Master</a> file in Github to get my updates of Pokemon and Moves. This gets updated much more frequently when stuff changes in the game. (At least, I think it does.) Going along with this, all Pokemon data and moves are stored in the database, which makes it MUCH easier to change manually.</p><p>Second, I updated the UI. Only I could read it before. Now, I added labels on the numbers, and added images of the Pokemon and more colors, too. The Pokemon images really really pop, and make it super easy to scan the lists. I also added rounded corners, because Fuck yeah!</p><div class='title'><b>Further Updates</b></div><p>I'm not completely happy with a lot of the white-on-white text, so I need to fix that at some point.</p><p>Also, one of my users complained that he still didn't understand anything, so I was thinking of making pages for each raid boss that showed more detail, such as which moves were available, and pokemon types and weaknesses. I'll get to that at some point.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/projects/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
