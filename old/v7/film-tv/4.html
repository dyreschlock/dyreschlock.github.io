| February 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, the WGA and the AMPTP have finally agreed on a contract and tonight, the members of the WGA will vote to accept this contract, END the strike, and return to work on Wednesday morning.  Good News ^_^.  This contract succeeds at getting writers a fair shake at internet reruns and new form of media, but really screws over writers for reality TV shows.  It's rather interesting how much actual television and movie writers look down upon reality TV writers.  Actually, what I find most interesting is that reality TV shows have writers.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 Saved</b></div><p>Anyways, with the strike ending ABC has picked up 9 series for the coming fall season.  LOST, of course, is on that list. ^_^.  Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof have wasted no time with the end of the strike near, to announce they have plans to finish Season 4 the way it was intended.</p><p>Originally, Season 4 and subsequent seasons, have been slated for 16 total episodes, but with the strike, Season 4 had only 8 episodes completed.  Cuse has stated today that they are going to push out another 5 episodes to complete all the Season 4 story arcs and finish it correctly (<a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574">aint it cool</a>).  Good News, indeed ^_^</p><p>So far, Season 4 has rather interesting.  At the beginning of Seasons 2 and 3, we began from the point of view outside of the cast, in the eyes of whom the largest mystery was in the previous season.  That didn't happen this time.  In fact, it did finally happen in episode 2 of season 4.  Episode 1 felt more like an extension of the Season 3 ending, but still introduced new topics for Season 4.</p><p>I felt episode 2 was kinda flat, but episode 1 was pretty slick.  Keep 'em coming ^_^</p><p>Another little bit of news, thanks to the "enhanced" episode of the Season 3 finale, and the "catch up" episode prior to the season premiere, Lost Season 4 Episode 1 netted 16.1 million viewers: one of their highest viewer turnouts in the series history.  The highest point was 18 million, i think, for some episode in season 1.</p><div class='title'><b>More TV</b></div><p>Just as a reminder, <b>Jericho</b> Season 2 premieres tonight on CBS, though you can download episodes 1, 2, and 3 on the internet if you don't want to wait.  These 3 episodes pretty much confirm my feelings towards the series.  Great characters, great entertainment, but the whole "mystery" has pretty much been revealed.  The intrigue of the series now is watching to see what happens.</p><p>Also on CBS, <b>Dexter</b> Season 1 begins this coming Sunday in its full edited form.  It's a great show, but cutting out all the death and blood in a show that is built on death and blood doesn't sound like a great move.  If you haven't seen Dexter, definitely check it out ^_^.  Hopefully, they've done a professional editing job.</p><p>Along-side Dexter on NBC is the 2 hour premiere of the new <b>Knight Rider</b> series.  This is a direct sequel to David Hasslehoff TV classic.  <a href="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html" title="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html">Here's a sneak Peak</a>.  (via <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35587" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35587">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>In other TV news, I should really get around to watching Sarah Connor Chronicles.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The End of Spring Television" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-end-of-spring-television">The End of Spring Television</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 6, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One week ago, Aint it cool posted a defacto list of <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35177" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35177">spring season premieres</a>, which contains the dates of 3 shows I care about: Lost, Jericho, and Sarah Connor Chronicles.  All Dates that I previously <a href="/old/v7/television-next-year" title="/television-next-year">wrote about</a>.  Those Dates again are...</p><p>Sarah Connor Chronicles (Terminator) Series Premiere, Fox, Sunday January 13th<br/>LOST Season 4, ABC, Thursday January 31st<br/>Jericho Season 2, CBS, Tuesday February 12th</p><p>The other day Aint it cool posted a very similar list that detailed <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35192" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35192">spring season finales</a>, which were much different than i thought they would be.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4</b></div><p>Lost begins on Jan 31st and ends on Mar 20th.  That's a mere 8 episodes compared to the scheduled 16 episodes.  I guess the 8 episodes that were completed before the strike is it..  they didn't finish off the rest of the series whether it was written or not.  They halved it.  Just like Heroes, and every other show that started back in September.</p><p>No wonder Cruse and Lindelof think the season "ender" isn't as powerful as previous seasons..  It'll probably parallel the first 6 episodes of Season 3 over a year ago.  "Here's a taste of this Season.. and you won't get the rest until later."  Of course, with Season 3 they wanted to hold off until all the episodes were complete and they could air without hiatus.  The strike paints a much different reason for hiatus.</p><p>I'm somewhat concerned about the future of Lost if the entire Season 4 is a mere 8 episodes...</p><p>Towards the end of Season 3, the creators of Lost states that Lost has an ending.  Lost was set to end with 6 seasons total, with 16 episodes in each of its remaining seasons.  I'm not sure how strong those set of previous facts were...  if there is a contract behind that or...</p><p>What are these 8 episodes..?  Are these 8 episodes all of Season 4 or are these the first half?   and will we get the remaining 40 episodes that were intended to follow..  are those 40 episodes scaled down to 32 now?</p><p>If these 8 episodes fall flat, is Lost, as a series, in trouble..?  Is Lost cancellable?  God I hope not...</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho Season 2</b></div><p>Speaking of cancellable..  Jericho Season 2 is literally Jericho's second chance as a series.</p><p>Over the Christmas break, I watched all 22 episodes of the first season and I'm hooked..  Jericho presents itself very much like Lost and the story of Jericho perpetuates it beautifully.  The difference is that Jericho has split nearly all its mysteries by the end of Season 1.  At that end of the season, I'm more concerned with what is going to happen than what is happening.</p><p>In Lost, they keep the important mysteries floating around and unsolved so you continue to speculate.  Each season finale of Lost posts a significant milestone in the series.  Some huge event occurs that dramatically alters the story, the final missing piece of a puzzle is revealed, and is topped off with a cliffhanger giving the direction of the next season.</p><p>The entire first season of Jericho continued to escalate and escalate.  The writers basically threw everything into the fire to keep it burning as bright as possible..  but a brilliant fire burns twice as bright, half as long.  Season 1 is a fantastic ride, but I really don't have the ambition to watch it over again.  Once Season 4 of Lost is complete, I'll probably start the series all over again at episode 1, but would I do the same with Jericho?</p><p>ANYWAYS...  Jericho Season 2 begins on Feb 12th and ends March 25th..  only 7 episodes.  This is Jericho's final test for the market.  If these 7 episodes don't get the ratings...</p><p>I dunno...  I am skeptical...  Jericho is pretty well laid out at this point...  we just need to wait and see what happens.</p><div class='title'><b>Sarah Connor Chronicles</b></div><p>On the other hand we have a completed new show: Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which takes place 2 years after Terminator 2..  several years still prior to Terminator 3.  I guess this story will show just what happened to Sarah Connor in between those movies and show how John Connor learned to trust her vision of the future.</p><p>This kinda screws up the beautiful chronological space the movies shared.. Terminator 1, 2 and 3 happened in 1984, 1991, and 2003, respectively..  both when the movies were released and when the events in the Terminator timeline happen..  In fact, Terminator 4 is slated for 2009..  6 years into the machine war. ^_^</p><p>Oh well, a little side story filling in the important gaps in a different medium can bend the rules a little bit.</p><p>Keep in mind that in Terminator 2, they machine war break out was supposed to occur in 1997, but in Terminator 3 it came full circle that you cannot change the future... only delay it.  In this case, the delay was 6 years, and the Sarah Connor Chronicles should reveal more of how this delayed..  or perhaps how it was inevitably set to ignite in 2003.</p><p>I really really wonder how well the Sarah Connor Chronicles will stick to the chronology of the series.  2 years after Terminator 2 is 1993..  Are we going to see 1993 objects?  or 2007-8 continuity errors..</p><p>On last thing to note is that the good terminator, previously played by Arnold, is played by Summer Glau, famously known by geeks as River Tam of Firefly and Serenity.  She's really the show's biggest star too...  unless you count the Terminator branding, which will be the main, if not only reason people would bother watching this show.</p><p>ANYWAYS..  Sarah Connor Chronicles begins next Sunday Jan 13th, and continues on Monday Jan 14th to its normal timeslot.  It will continue 8 weeks until March 3rd, spanning 9 episodes.  Odd that IMDB has 12 episodes listed.</p><p>I'm definitely going to check it out next Sunday ^_^..   Check out these previous on yahoo: <a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/terminator-the-sarah-connor-chronicles/show/39221/videos" title="http://tv.yahoo.com/terminator-the-sarah-connor-chronicles/show/39221/videos">http://tv.yahoo.com/terminator-the-sarah-connor-chronicles/show/39221/videos</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Juno" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/juno">Juno</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| December 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night my little brother and I caught a movie at one of our local theaters, the Eden Praire Mall. It was a real heartwarming tale, but there were two things that really distracted me about the movie that kept me away from feeling the raw emotion so many women in the audience felt.</p><div class='title'><b>Synopsis</b></div><p>Juno is about a young girl (Ellen Page) named Juno. She is sixteen years ago and has found out that she is pregnant after having sex for the first time with her boyfriend (Michael Cera). She realizes that she can't possibly care for the child herself and she toys with the idea of abortion but can't go through with it. So she turns to adoption and finds a couple Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and her husband (Jason Bateman).</p><p>By the partial cast listing, it's pretty easy to see why I wanted to see this movie. I was very interested in seeing Michael Cera and Jason Bateman in serious roles outside of their type-cast roles they've been in since Arrested Development. To their character, they still were Michael and George Michael, but they acted great in their moments of seriousness. I hope they find more roles like this in the future, so I can see more of their acting ability. ^_^ I'll settle for their hilarious comedic character though..</p><p>Tangent: Both have movies coming out, by the way.. Michael Cera will return in Apatow's Year One sometime in 2009, while Michael Cera will support Will Smith in Hancock July 2008.</p><div class='title'><b>Distraction #1</b></div><p>Anyways, these two nagging distractions really only apply to me. One thing that really pissed me off was this searing pain in my neck I had ever since I woke up in the morning. I mean, it was like someone hammered a nail right into my spine in the base of my neck .. The pain was almost paralyzing. I'm actually quite reliefed that I can move today. That and I was so monsterously sick the past two days.. ugh. but Hurrah.. i'm in better health today!</p><p>Unfortunately, the nagging pain was the main emotion I felt which really drew away any overwhelming happiness the vast amount of the female audience felt due to their constant sniffling and "awwww honey, hold me" sentiment.</p><div class='title'><b>Distraction #2</b></div><p>The other thing that nagged me a bit was their location in the movie. From the beginning, it looked like Juno lived in any normal rural town. The first name drop was given by Michael Cera's character when he mention his friend or brother went to <i>Mankato</i> for college. That was a big flag.. 'Mankato? As in Mankato State in Mankato, MN?'.. hmm..</p><p>My suspicions were confirmed with Juno gave the next name drop when she talked about some girl tearing off all her clothes and jumping into the fountain at <i>Ridgedale</i> mall. Bingo.. I knew it. West Suburbs of Minneapolis.. where I grew up. The mission became to figure out exactly where Juno lived in the movie.</p><p>Well.. that's where the location kinda falls apart. A couple times in the movie Juno drives out to see the adopting parents who live in a rich suburb entitled <i>Glacial Valley Estates</i>, which is later identified as residing in <i>St. Cloud</i>, an <i>hour and a half</i> away. OK, so if Juno goes to ridgedale often and St. Cloud is an hour and a half away, then she probably lives in Plymout, Maple Grove or whatever cities are in between there.</p><p>What screws up this theory is Juno's Step-mom says "why the hell would go the East Jesus out there" when talking about St. Cloud. Ridgedale is in Plymouth which is directly West of Minneapolis and Maple Grove is directly North of St. Cloud. To go to St. Cloud from Ridgedale, you'd take 494 to Maple Grove and continue along I-94 to St. Cloud, which is directly North-West of Maple Grove. There's nothing East Jesus about it.</p><p>For St. Cloud to be East anything of Juno's house it would take her around 3 hours to get to Ridgedale, and the scene where Juno just happens to run into Vanessa AT Ridgedale makes absolutely no sense. Well.... nevermind, I guess it could make sense if it were a Satuday or Sunday. I guess North-west-wise Ridgedale is the best mall option.. both Northern malls are crap. well, Northdale is probably remodeled by now, but its difficult to get to and further away than Ridgedale.</p><p>Anyways, that was bothering me the whole movie. I'm glad I went to go see this movie with my little brother because if I saw this with anyone in Madison or from school, they would have been constantly annoyed with me talking to myself trying to slooth their location. In fact, the woman sitting next to my little brother kept telling me to shut up with her evil eye.</p><p>Later on, you get full view of their high school's name: "Dancing Elk High School", which I'm fairly certain doesn't exist.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't have Internet here so I can't really check up on anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Anyways, Juno is fantastic. It's comedy-style has a very Napoleon Dynamite spin, but thank god the characters don't act that way. It's extremely heartwarming, powerful, funny.. It's really great. Definitely check it out.</p><p>Thankfully I got their nagging distractions out of the way the first time I saw it, so when I see it again and show it to people I'm not constantly talking during the film.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Television next year" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/television-next-year">Television next year</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week is the last week for new TV.  Most shows have already finished, but "last to cross the finish line" new show <b>Journeyman</b> finally makes it in with Episode 11 tonight at 9pm central and Episode 12 on Wednesday at 9pm central.</p><div class='title'><b>Journeyman Finale</b></div><p>These final two episodes finally explain how Dan Vassar has been traveling through time answering that Lingering question.  Although with the end of the series, due to poor ratings, we are missing out on the bigger question of why Dan is traveling through time.  Series creator Kevin Falls has said that if the show had continued the season finale would have put all of Dan's time traveling into perspective.  Each leap through time is meant to align time in such a way to make an event happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, Journeyman was too slow and too disjointed to give this impression starting off.  If the audience would have realized Dan's time traveling was important, I think they would have much more viewers.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>January 2008</b></div><p>With Journeyman's finale 2007 ends, but despite the writer's continued strike, Late Night TV will return in January with or without their writers.  Specifically The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  Both shows will return and air new episodes beginning Wednesday January 2nd.</p><p>Both Leno and O'Brien have been huge supporters of the strike.  Their return is to start supporting their non-writing staff who have been laid off during these last two months of reruns.</p><p>David Letterman, on the other hand, is attacking the situation differently.  Letterman is attempting to strike an interim deal between Studio Execs and the WGA so when he returns on January 2nd, he'll have his writers.</p><p>Interesting developments..  The below linked article also suggests some alternative programming for Leno and Conan in lew of their monologue.  They might have more guests to fill in the time...</p><p>(source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A">New York times</a>)</p><div class='title'><b>February 2008</b></div><p>Besides Late Night returning, there are 2 amazing TV shows which return in the Spring that we haven't seen since their finales back in May..  Lost and Jericho.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 - Thursday January 31st, 8pm Central</b></div><p>On Friday, the Lost Season 4 trailer flew across the Internet and made many people happy.  Here it is, in case you missed it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho</a></p><p>At first I was baffled..  "really?  It's still coming out despite the strike?  Last I heard, they only completed 8 of the 16 episodes before November 1st."  Later in the day, Aint it cool <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076">reported</a> on the return of Lost stating that January 31st will be the beginning.</p><p>Upon further inspection, it looks they finished up Season 4 without the writers..  I mean, all the scripts were written before the strike began, but the writers are VERY involved with each episode as they make it.  They are always on hand to guide and shape each episode to fit their perfect vision.  They completed 8 episodes this way before the strike, so the final 8 episodes were done without the personal touch, which doesn't bode well.</p><p>Aint it Cool states that Showrunners Carlton Cruse and Damon Lindelof think the season finale is weak compared to previous Seasons.  That's rather pessimistic.</p><p>Lost Season 4 is 16 episodes which will air week after week without break.  I don't know if the season premiere and finale count as 2 each..  probably not.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho</b></div><p>Over the weekend, I caught my first glimpse of Jericho and my god..  this show is pretty damn awesome.  It's a lot like Lost except it hits real close to home..  I don't want to give away any of the story, though.</p><p>I went into Jericho episode 1 completely blind.  I had no idea what Jericho is, what is was about, or who was even in it.  All I knew is that the Internet saved this show and that people love it.  The first couple minutes of the show were pretty stereotypically, but when that climax music began to seep into the opening and you could absolutely tell that at any moment the plot of the entire show was going to hit...  I even said outloud.. "whatever is about to happen is going to make me love this show.. I just know it.."</p><p>then BAM...  I am an instant fan of this show.  It was totally engaging and made me want to watch every single episode after.</p><p>Jericho Season 1 has been out on DVD since October, so you can definitely netflix it..  OR you can watch every single episode of Jericho on the CBS website.  Yeah, it's crappy quality and Yeah, they have advertisements, but it'll give you a taste and, personally, a taste is all I needed.</p><p>Here's a quick link to all the episodes on cbs.com: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261" title="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261</a></p><p>If you really want to give yourself they perfect experience, Netflix the first DVD, put in it your player, turn up the sound, and turn off the lights.  You'll be on the edge of your seat.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho Season 2 - Tuesday February 12th, 9pm Central</b></div><p>Anyways, thanks to the Internet, Jericho has been saved from cancellation and CBS has ordered 8 more episodes.  If all goes well with the ratings, CBS will order the rest of the season and probably more to come ^_^.</p><p>Much like Lost and other shows, these 8 episodes were surely completed before the strike, so they should be magnificent.</p><div class='title'><b>Other shows</b></div><p>For now, that's really all I can foresee coming to TV.  Some episodes of The Office, 30Rock and Earl were completely before the strike, so those couple episodes will probably air here and there in the spring..</p><p>In the meantime though...  enjoy winter!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End of Journeyman" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-of-journeyman">End of Journeyman</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Yesterday was NBC's deadline to secure the show for a second-half, but they passed on it, which means the cast is free to look for work elsewhere and has no obligation to continue working on the show. Balls..</p><p>This doesn't mean NBC can't renew the show.. They can do so at anytime. SaveJourneyman.Net is still holding on hope of renew. With the writer's strike there will certainly be a sharp decline of pilot episodes for the coming spring, so why not renew the show.. You aren't going to have anything new to show otherwise?</p><p>SaveJourneyman's compaign continues, though. Much like the Nuts for Jericho campaign, they are sending boxes of Rice-a-Roni to the studio executives along with letters from the future.</p><p>The most-likely final episodes of Journeyman will air on Monday and Wednesday next week and hope to answer some of the reasons why Dan is time-traveling and what is actually going on. They should have answered these questions much sooner. It would have made the show more interesting and plot heavy, rather than focusing on the more heavy drama aspects of the effects on his family.</p><p>My favorite thing about Journeyman is the excellent theme song. It's a collaboration between UK artist Amanda Ghost and band Rural. It hasn't been released on its own, but they are working on a full version and a single release sometime in the future. ^_^</p><p>Oh well... kinda sucks that its going. Journeyman will appear on DVD some time in the future.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-update">Journeyman Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Tonight at 9 (10 eastern) an episode of Life will air starting a two-parter to end in its usual timeslot of Wednesday.  Next Monday, Journeyman returns with its Christmas episodes and the next week will contain two episodes ending at half a season.  These two episodes promise to bring some answers as to what is actually going on with Dan's time leaping.</p><p>The internet's mobilization to Save Journeyman begins today!</p><p>What you can do to help save Journeyman is log on to nbc.com and watch episode 10 entitled "Blowback".  In fact, here's a quick link for you: <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml" title="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml">http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml</a>.</p><p>This is the most recent episode of Journeyman and has really been the highlight of the show thus far.  In "Blowback", Dan learns more about the limitations of changing the past and how to fix mistakes when he alters the past beyond his "goal", whether or not his alterations were ethical.</p><p>The goal of this "demostration" is to show that people out there want to watch this show.  A spike in their online ratings should show we care right?</p><div class='title'><b>Quantum Leap</b></div><p>On a side note, one of my friends starting Netflixing Quantum Leap, so we've been watching an episode here and there.  That show is really a trip back in time in itself these days, seeing how it was made back in 1982.  Going back in time even further than that to fix the past makes it very interesting on several levels.</p><p>The shows humor and story are still quite solid to this day.  Definitely check it out, especially if you remember watching that show.  I used to watch that show over and over again when they aired re-runs on USA and the Scifi channel. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman &quot;final&quot; episode will air" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-final-episode-will-air">Journeyman "final" episode will air</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Episode 10 will air on Monday December 10th, followed by Episode 11 on the following Monday.  Episode 12 is placed on Wednesday December 19th at 10/9c.  Not too shabby.  (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>As that article suggested, the decision to air episode 12 came from the caring, passionate support of internet fans, namely those at <a href="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/">SaveJourneyman.net</a>.  Those involved with the site are trying to organize a "Save our Show" campaign similar to what happened with Jericho.</p><p>Earlier this year <a href="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/">Nuts Online .com</a> instituted a campaign called "Nuts for Jericho" where fans contributed money towards a daily shipment of peanuts to CBS New York.  A grand total of $56,968 was spent, totaling over 8 million peanuts.  Check it out: <a href="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho">Nuts for Jericho</a>.</p><p>And it worked!  CBS signed Jericho for a 2nd season.</p><p>It doesn't really look like SaveJourneyman.net is as organized as Nuts for Jericho, but there's plenty of time.. thanks to the strike.  Even though Life and Chuck were renewed, they still need to make those episodes..  If the strike is resolved within this next month, I wonder if they'll try to complete seasons by May..</p><p>hmm... I should probably netflix Jericho to see what all the fuss is about.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to NBC Monday Night updates" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nbc-monday-night-updates">NBC Monday Night updates</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After last week's phenomenal episode, the story continues to build to the fall season finale.  This story arc ends next week, and with that we probably won't see any new episodes of Heroes for a while, due to strike.  With the strike..  episode 11 of Heroes Season 2 is somewhat posed to be the overall season finale. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>Recanting <a href="/old/v7/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman">last week's post</a>, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter (episodes 8 and 9) .. brings big numbers."  I watched both episodes and they were quite good.  I'm almost sad to see the show go.  The plot of Journeyman is really coming together, and the fall finale (two-parter of episodes 11 and 12) bring the plot full circle as it is finally told why Dan is traveling through time.</p><p>Journeyman has 3 episodes left, but won't be airing next week.  Next week, after Heroes, that new cop-drama, Life, will air the beginning of a two-parter to end on its normal timeslot on Wednesday.  The week after is Journeyman's "Christmas episode".  The next Monday after that on December 17th, will be the first episode of the finale, episode 11.  Unfortunately, it seems that episode 12 may not even air according to <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883">Aint it Cool</a>.</p><p>After watching this past week, I'm really quite excited to see what happens, but with the numbers in the toilet, it doesn't seem like Journeyman will even gets its end aired.  But, for those fans out there, Journeyman will be released on DVD will its high-budgeted music soundtrack intact, and including all episodes. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>At this time, NBC has ordered more episodes of Life and that crappy show Chuck, through the rest of their debut seasons...  but Journeyman is still on the chopping block. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>I'd probably like Journeyman more if the episodes followed a stricter plot.  The episodes have been very episodic, giving bits and pieces of the overall plot in each episode.  I'd much rather be absorbed in the story the whole time, like in Heroes and Lost, then you can see everything in the show develop at once.. characters evolve..  plot is continuous.  You never feel like you're wasting your time watching an episode.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>In other news.... Strike</b></div><p>Some of the commercials tonight for new programming beginning in January really makes me feel like the Strike is taking its toll on programming.  Especially with a trailer for the return of <b>American Gladiators</b> to prime-time television, beginning January 7th-ish.  ugh...  I'll probably still watch the premiere episode, though..</p><p>Some good news, though..  Yet another <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897">Aint it Cool</a> article states that the strike could be resolved before Christmas.  Nice! ^_^</p><p>...and just in time for the strike ending, I got my "Support the Strike" cancer bracelets in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" /></p><p>Lemme know if you'd like a bracelet..

Its Heroes night.  Tonight's Heroes is chapter 9 of the 11 chapter fall season.  The next two weeks will put a cap on the current story arc that supposedly explodes tonight.  (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34826" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34826">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>This fall season, Heroes is followed by Jouneyman, which I had <a href="/old/v7/journeyman-new-on-nbc" title="/journeyman-new-on-nbc">commented on before</a>.  Journeyman is a lot like a modern day Quantum Leep that puts Drama ahead of Science Fiction.  The stories are interesting, but the characters are so serious and unlikeable, it makes watching the show difficult.</p><p>Tonight and next week end the fall season of Journeyman with a two-parter, and possibly the last Journeyman we'll ever see, states <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34841" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34841">Ain't it cool News</a>.  To paraphrase, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter airing tonight and next Monday brings big numbers."</p><p>I suppose this would be a good time to talk about Neilson ratings and market share or something else if I actually knew what I were talking about..

| November 6, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My whole reason for signing up with Netflix was to rent Undeclared.  Undeclared is a TV show that aired on Fox beginning in 2000 and lasting one mere season before being canceled.  Much like other brilliant Fox comedies, we hardly knew ye.</p><div class='title'><b>Premise</b></div><p>Undeclared centers on Steven Karp, new freshman to the University of Northeastern California.  Now in college, Steven is able to shed his geek nature and start a new life.  His roommates are Lloyd, a dashing british exchange student going for a degree in theater, Ron, a business major played by Seth Rogen, and Marshall, a scruffy looking guy working on a music degree despite his parents pushing his into business.</p><p>The first night of college changes Steven's life as he meets Lizzie, a cute girl from across the hall with an overprotective boyfriend at home, played by Jason Segal.  Her roommate is Rachael, whose having her own problems with adjusting to college.</p><p>Each episode attempts to center on a specific topic of adjusting to college life, much like Freaks and Geeks did for High School and home life.</p><div class='title'><b>Interest</b></div><p>Undeclared was created by Judd Apatow, which was the sole purpose for my initial interest in the show.  He also co-created Freaks and Greeks which I've written about before (<a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">here</a> and <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">here</a>).  He's also been chiefly responsible for 40 year old virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad.  All with the underlying theme of Freaks and Geeks..  Freaks being pot heads and burn outs, and Geeks being..  geeks.  Because they follow this pattern, Judd Apatow's properties are full of movie references and drug humor which our generation can easily identify with.</p><p>Undeclared is no different than the rest but really shows Apatow's true calling in his craft.  Don't get me wrong, I think Freaks and Geeks is probably his greatest show to date, but it's too heavy and too real.  I feel so much emotion when watching that show, I'm not sure how more of it I can take..  Undeclared takes a step back from that and focuses more on the comedy.  The comedy floats to the surface and lets the subtle drama aspects govern the plot, but not the scene.</p><p>The Office uses a similar formula.  You come to the show for its comedy, but stay and continue to watch because of the characters and their relationships.  The Office wouldn't work with any other actors playing these characters, and neither would Undeclared.</p><p>Squeezing the show into half an hour really forces the comedy to take center stage too.  There's really no time to build a compelling drama high in such a short time and still make it funny.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>This show is pretty damn hilarious..  Each character and actor complements each other so well..  It makes the show incredibly believable and enjoyable.  Definitely check it out ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/film-tv/5">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/film-tv/3">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
