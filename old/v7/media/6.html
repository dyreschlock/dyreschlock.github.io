| September 19, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For his "College Invasion" Fall tour, larger than life, trance superstar DJ Tiesto, made Madison, WI one of his stops.  What?  It's kinda odd thinking about Tiesto performing in Madison.</p><p>Though, given how the scene has been exploding around here, and local bookers have been getting some serious talent to come to our town, AND how this is a college tour and Madison is one of top 10 schools in the country, I guess it makes sense.  This is a DJ concert anyway.  He's not playing in some fancy douche bag club.</p><p>Tickets were a mere $37, which is cheap compared to almost any gig in the last 5 years. Also, he took the trouble to come to my town. He's bringing the show to me! I can walk to the damn concert. So, I decided to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Merchandising</b></div><p>To prove just how big a sellout he is, upon entering the lobby of the Alliant Energy Center, I'm greeted with several booths selling and advertising shit.</p><p>There's Tiesto's merchandise booth with a whole lot of overpriced T-Shirts, and other crap.  There's a photo booth!  You can get your picture standing next to a picture background of Tiesto!  Hot Damn!  There was a booth that had the Playstation Move setup showing off some game.  There was a booth with energy drinks.  And another for Axe Body spray.</p><p>I think the bigger offense was during Porter Robinson's opening set.  The huge LED display behind would switch to ads! Which advertised the merchandise booth out in the lobby.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp"  /></p><p>People love rockin' out to T-Shirts!</p><div class='title'><b>Porter Robinson</b></div><p>Opening for Tiesto was Porter Robinson.  I got there around 8:30pm, so I caught the last half hour of his set before Tiesto began at 9pm.  As I entered, he was jammin to a remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4">Deadmau5 - Raise your Weapon</a> that sounded like Madeon's fantastic remix.  It was much longer, and the extended parts didn't sound like it at all, so maybe it was a mashup, or something.</p><p>He set was pretty cookie cutter.  He played songs similar to what I've heard the locals spin around here.  He threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc">Wolfgang Gartner - Illmerica</a> towards the end, which felt like he was going for the popular vote, rather than building his own sound.  (At least, I think it was Illmerica.  It was some well known Wolfgang song.)</p><p>But whatever, I only caught the last half hour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Tiesto</b></div><p>Man, I got there at the perfect time.  I didn't have to stand through any of the openers at all.  30 minutes after I arrived, Tiesto took the stage and started up his set.</p><p>I got the recorded the first 70 minutes of this (plus a few other clips), so take a look for yourself.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627</a></p><p>He starts off which a self indulging intro.  It's probably the club life theme song.  After he throws in a sample of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk">Imogen Heap - Hide &amp; Seek</a> (I thought it was BT at first), and starts hopping from trance anthem to trance anthem, and eventually goes into more Big Room (or whatever) House.  He pretty much kept with the Housey trend throughout the rest of the set, though some songs still kept a trancey vibe.  It's the kind of sound that he's known for these days.</p><p>He DID throw in a few classic tracks, which was a pleasant surprise.  One of which was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw">Delerium - Silence (Tiesto Remix)</a>.  Only it WASN'T the Tiesto Remix!  Arrgghh.  It was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4">W&amp;W + Jonas Stenberg Remix.</a> This song is evil.  It uses the exact same build up as the Tiesto mix, but then shits all over itself with a breaky climax, rather than the beautiful atmospheric sound of the original.  Fuck this song.</p><p>I caught a few other songs too, but I don't remember their names.  (I did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0">record</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ">them</a>, though.)   He ended with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujB7A5ycew" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujB7A5ycew">Tiesto v. Diplo - C'Mon</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Sound</b></div><p>The two panoramics above illustrate the kind of place this concert was held at.  This is the exhibition hall in the Alliant Energy Center.  A huge room surrounded by concrete and steel.  And, as Zack reminds me, the same place were they have horse shows, and monster truck rallies.  It's the same basic layout as an airline hanger.</p><p>The accoustics are horrible.  The bass bounces off all the walls, and makes a thunderous sound that echos through the entire space.  It drowns out any actual noise from the bass itself.  It turns into this Boom-Boom-Boom.  So, every bass line is identical throughout the set.  You can hear this quite plainly in the video I took.</p><p>The rest of the levels were jacked up, so you COULD make out what the songs actually were.  But even that had echo in this huge concrete hall.  Certainly not as much echo as the bass, but it still blurred the songs a tad.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>A Good Time</b></div><p>While, I'm pretty down on Tiesto, and he is a total sellout and a bit of a hack, I had a great time.  But, with my expectations so damn low to begin with, there's no place to go but up!</p><p>The crowd was quite amazing, too.  I think that was the biggest surprise for me.  There were some college kids there, but they were mostly in the huge bit in front of the stage.  Hanging back in the comfortable section were the actual fans.  Tiesto fans maybe, but definitely Trance fans.  Clubbers from Chicago and Milwaukee, and a bunch of kids that just wanted to dance and have fun.  There weren't any huge assholes.</p><p>When Tiesto hit on his mark with the Trance hits, everyone in the crowd was dancing and cheering.  Everyone was totally in the moment with this concert.  People were actually paying attention!  Rather than typing on their phone, or yelling at each other, or trying to feel each other up.</p><p>I haven't seen a crowd this responsive in a while.  But maybe this could be because it was on a weekday rather than a weekend, and people weren't drinking the night away.  And most trance fans are older than the new crop of EDM fans who are into dubstep, electro house, and all that stuff.</p><p>I had fun :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-3">North Coast Music Festival - Day 3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

DJ Solo opened the Red Bull stage, but the next act I cared to see was Little Dragon at 5:30.  So, Five and I took the train and headed downtown for the afternoon.</p><p>We finally go the chance to visit Wow Bao, an Asian fast food place that Five had wanted to go to for a very long time.  We had some lunch, and took a tour of Grant Park and Millenium Park.  We took pictures of the bean and the fountain.  After that, we headed to Rotofugi to take a look at some art and toys.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I love this shot. Mostly because the panoramic assembler magically cropped out that girl's boyfriend.  Also, if you zoom in, you can see me!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6990_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6990_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6990_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6990_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6990_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I love this shot too.  It's unfortunate that I didn't take enough photos to cover the problems that ICE had putting them all together, but it still looks magnificent.  I think this is one of my better panoramic photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7001_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7001_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7001_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7001_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7001_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>This one is neat too. :)</p><p>Anyways, afternoon became early evening, so I made my way back to North Coast.  I made it just in time to catch <b>Little Dragon</b> begin their live set on the main stage.  And they were nothing that I thought they would be.  I was in the mood to dance and hop around, and these guys were some indie hippie electronica band.  Not what I wanted...</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I took some pictures, grabbed some food, and waited for ATB to perform on the Red Bull stage.</p><div class='title'><b>ATB</b></div><p>I think everyone had the same idea because when <b>ATB</b> climbed on stage, the surrounding crowd grew immensely.  And everyone threw their hands in the air, and hopped up and down, which created a massive dirt cloud.  Yesterday, the rain and the crowd had turned the park into a mud pit, and today all that mud had dried into dirt.  And now that dirt is in the air, along with all the horrible cigarette smoke.  At least it's 70 today, instead of 90.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>ATB's set was pretty vanilla for him.  It was nearly identical to his set from early 2010 in Minneapolis.  He opened with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao">ATB - Ecstasy</a>, and followed up with boring trance, all the while sampling (teasing) his classic track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4">ATB - 9pm (Till I Come)</a>, which he never fully played.</p><p>ATB is the king of mediocre trance.  There's no way he could follow Andy Moor from last night.  And you could tell he had to fall back on pandering to the crowd when he played the Woo Hoo song (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk">Blur - Song 2</a>).  Really?!</p><p>I find it rather odd that ATB is the only representation of Trance at North Coast, and he's not even that good.  They couldn't find anyone from Armada or Anjuna that wasn't busy this weekend to play some decent trance?  They had Paul van Dyk last year for gods sake...</p><div class='title'><b>Benny Bennasi</b></div><p>ATB finished his horrid set, and left the stage to <b>Benny Bennasi</b>.  His sound was very raw and energetic.  He primary sticks to Electro House, but his sound is very Club House or Big Room or whatever you call it.  Unlike horrible hacks like David Guetta, he kept to a cohesive beat, which makes it actually danceable.  It fits the festival perfectly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>But I think the weekend had started to takes its toll on me.  After a fantastic Day 1 and 2, with nothing really going on for Day 3, and horrible ATB, I wasn't feeling the vibe at all.  I wanted something that actually spoke to me and set itself apart.</p><p>I stuck around for almost his whole set before wandering around the fest grounds again.  I should have left earlier so I could've caught <b>Of Montreal</b>, but oh well.  I didn't feel like staying for Bassnectar or Thievery Corporation, so I left to find some more delicious Chicago pizza at Gino's East.</p><p>I returned to Union Park just in time to hear the closing sounds of <b>Bassnectar</b> on the main stage, but I was outside of the park at the time.  I was waiting in line for tonight's after party at Transit.</p><div class='title'><b>Steve Bug &amp; Ida Engberg @ Transit</b></div><p>I've been to most clubs in Chicago, but I had never been to Transit before.  It had a very different floor plan than all the places I'm used to.  The only club that I could compare it to is Trinity in Seattle.  It had 3 completely separate rooms stacked with some major underground talent.</p><p>Kate Simko, DJ Heather, and rave-legend Woodie McBride ran things in the red room off to the side.  While a few other Chicago DJs opened for Minneapolis legends Jack Trash and Tyler Hampton in the loft room off to the other side.</p><p>The main room was in the center of the club.  The DJ booth was off to the side, and played itself off as an unimportant decoration.  The real focus was the circular dance floor in the center of the room.  It was aligned with VIP seating, speaker towers, sub woofers, and ceiling speakers.  Once you entered the circle, the sound was immense.  There were very few places you could escape the full wrath of sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp"  /></p><p>This night was incredibly nostalgic for me.  The openers in the main room played the type of House music that I grew up hearing in Minneapolis events.  It felt like all the non-Trance DJs in Minneapolis knew everything there was about House and nothing else.  At the time, I really wasn't into it.  The beat just kept going and going and going.  It changed when tracks changed, but it never really evolved into something else.</p><p>Though, when <b>Steve Bug</b> took over the decks that classic House sound definitely evolved.  It moved from repetition to something more layered and spacey, but kept the classic nature.  He blew those openers out of the fucking water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp"  /></p><p>He is different, and hard to describe.  It like someone switched off the "suck" in the club, and made it awesome.  Those openers weren't in the same league as this guy.  Not even close.  He pounded the club with some jagged smooth beats.  It was definitely a surprise.</p><p>The crowd didn't really seem to notice for some reason.  It was really a somber night for the kids in Transit.  Most of the club was dancing and hanging out, but no one was really whipping them into shape.  The club's layout really didn't put an importance on the DJ, so maybe it was better to create a vibe to enjoy, rather than pander to the crowd and make them pay attention.</p><p>I have a feeling that Steve Bug was holding back just a little bit.  He created an amazing atmosphere, but he wasn't tearing down the place.  I think he left that for <b>Ida Engberg</b>, because the crowd totally changed when she took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp"  /></p><p>She finally showed up around 2am, and started off a track or two that built off of Steve Bug's atmosphere.  It was electric and energetic.  The crowd started hopping up and down, and cheering her on.  So she reciprocated by bringing the thunder.</p><p>The rest of her set tore the place down and everyone went nuts.  Everyone in the whole club was on the dance floor, and completely ignored the DJs in the other rooms.  I didn't even realize there were this many people in the club.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp"  /></p><p>I rocked out to her set for about an hour.  I left around 3am, as it had been a long exhausting (amazing) weekend, and I had 150 miles to drive in front of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>This had been one of the best weekends out of the year for me.  It's really hard for me to choose between heading to Seattle, visiting Ace &amp; Jess, and attending PAX, versus heading down to Chicago for North Coast.  Both are the best weekends, and I'm really glad PAX was held one week earlier this year.  Last year, I did half North Coast and half PAX and I feel my overall experiences of both were lessened.  This year, I attended the full breadth of both and they really can't compete with each other.</p><p>As mentioned, James Zabiela and Carl Cox were total stand outs for me, along with Ida Engberg and Steve Bug following them up.  I hope that next year, North Coast is able to bring the amount of variety and quality they had this year.  Also, I hope they fucking bring more than ATB to represent trance, ugh...</p><p>In terms of numbers, I read that they were able to get 50,000 people into Union Park this year, which is 10,000 more than last year.  They should have plenty of cash to make next year even bigger.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">North Coast Music Festival - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I arrived around 2pm and headed over to the Red Bull stage for <b>Felix Cartal</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>He performed a great set to start the day.  Housey with some Electro.  An amazing beat with ripe sound.  A perfect build up to Zeds Dead, who performed next.</p><p>I'm not a fan of dubstep at all, but there is some I like, and <b>Zeds Dead</b> fall into that category.  They don't stick with the cookie cutter warble waaahhh.  They iterate on that, and keep a coherent beat.  It's actually danceable!  Maybe that's because they mix in a fair amount of Electro House behind their songs, along with some Drum &amp; Bass.  They threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg">Skrillex - Reptile Theme</a> near the end of their set.

These guys are a live electronica band.  They play drums and saxophone over a pre-recorded beat, and have a very unique sound.  Some songs are dubsteppy, and others are more dancey.  It's a very 80s/90s feel.  I like it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Next up, I went over to the Groupon Stage for <b>Future Rock</b>.  These guys are also a live.  They play synths, guitar and drums.  Their sound is very retro, but they follow a very modern dancey beat.  Very spacey and energetic.  Great Stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's some video of Future Rock : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0</a></p><p>They finished up around 6:30, so I started looking for some food.  The festival grounds are lined with several food tents from local restaurants and bars.  I had some egg rolls, and fish and chips.  Delicious and fatty fried foods.  Perfect for filling the stomach.</p><div class='title'><b>Carl Cox</b></div><p>Carl Cox was pretty damn awesome. :). You don't really hear his name much these days, but he's been around since the beginning.  Along with Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and John Digweed.  They built the English dance scene in the 90s.  This is my second time seeing him and it's been almost 10 years.  The first time was for his Global CD tour in 2002.</p><p>It's interesting to see how he's evolved.  He was pretty much straight House back in the day, which is all I heard from the clubs.  As people ages and tastes changed, the pure House sound has become somewhat niche, and I never hear of it anymore.  It seems that Carl Cox has evolved passed that and has become a renaissance man.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>His set tonight was genre breaking.  While his set was penned in an overall Housey tone, he threw in some Techno and Trance to bring everyone up to speed with the best that is out there.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">Maxime Dangles - Dhiaiz</a>!!  While it was all over the place, it was cohesive.  It made sense, and worked well.  It was fantastic. :)</p><p>I captured the whole set on video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1</a></p><p>While James Zabiela rocked my world yesterday, Carl Cox surprised and delighted me.  <b>These 2 guys are the clear highlight of North Coast for me.</b> I almost regret not going to his after party at The Mid.  But his was one of the first to sell out, so that club will be a crowded mess.  And it's usually that way on regular nights, so I think I'm better off heading off to Vision for Andy Moor.</p><div class='title'><b>Fatboy Slim &amp; STS9</b></div><p>Ending the night at the festival was <b>Fatboy Slim</b> headlining.  Unfortunately, he didn't really do anything for me.  Carl Cox completely blew me away, and anything else that followed needed to go further.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have not followed Fatboy Slim's music what so ever.  I know Star 69, but that's about it.  I can't really groove to his sound.  I listened to his promo mix for the Big Beach Festival in Tokyo earlier his year, and it didn't really speak to me, so I figured this performance would end up the same way.</p><p>It was really more of a concert anyway, rather than a DJ set, or even a festival DJ set at that.  But that crowd went absolutely nuts, and that's awesome.  It's good to see a legend of electronic music get the respect he deserves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp"  /></p><p>I took off a little early and listened to <b>STS9</b> for a little while, but they didn't really grab me either.

Hell yeah.</p><p>For the first time, We took the train into town rather than spend $20 or $30 on parking.  SO MUCH CHEAPER.  $2.75 train in town, $15 cab back to the car.  If we planned it better, we could've taken the train back.  This is my plan next time.</p><p>Anyway, we arrived at Vision around to some lack luster trance openers.  They played a few popular anthems, but kept the vibe in control and ready for The main act.</p><p>Andy Moor took the stage around 2am, I think.  He started off quite solid.  I didn't recognize many of the tracks, but it was a solid vibe.  He kept the energy up, and never fell into that stereotypical trance pattern.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp"  /></p><p>About an hour in, things began to change.

While it's not really my favorite song, it is the type of song that EVERYONE knows.  The entire crowd erupted in song and dance.  The track that followed set the tone for the rest of the night.  Raw and powerful.  I should have recorded it, so I could ID it later.  It rocked my world.</p><p>For the next two hours, he pulled out some mighty bangers.

After picking up the car from the rental place, I was on the road around 2pm.  Not terrible, but it put me in the throws of Chicago gridlock.  After checking into the motel and forgetting I was supposed to go to Union Park (not Wicker Park), I got there in time to hear the last 15 minutes of Zabiela's set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Man, <b>James Zabiela</b> was on fire.  I haven't heard any breaks in a long time, and it's so refreshing to hear them as crisp as I remember.  I'm totally excited for his after-party tonight at Sound Bar.  I was pretty sad that the crowd was so sparse, but those that were there were hanging on each break he threw down.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I took a bunch of pictures, but wasn't able to get video.  Afterward, I wandered around the festival grounds, looking at the vendors and their merchandise.  One of them had some beautiful trippy tapestries for super cheap, so I bought one. :)</p><p>I waited around the North Coast stage for Wolfgang, and listened to <b>Sbtrkt</b>'s opening set.  I thought it was pretty good.  Not my kind of music, bit it definitely had groove to it.  Nice and smooth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>He finished, and the roadies started setting up the stage for <b>Wolfgang Gartner</b>.  10 minutes he hopped on stage to NO sound.  It took them a couple of minutes to fix that, and then he was off.  His set included many of his hits, so it felt much like a concert than a DJ set.  His filler tracks were not for me... I thought I liked this guy, but his set was very uninspired.  No where near what his essential sounded like.  It was pretty disappointing...  though maybe he was nervous and played it safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's the first 16 minutes of him on stage: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g</a></p><p>While he was jammin his hits, the crowd began to grow immensely.  There was a good amount of area to move at the start, but after 15 minutes, it was wall to wall bodies.  Hot sweaty half-naked bodies dripping with sweat from the 90, 95 degree weather.  I wore the wrong clothes to this pit, so I got out of the crowd to avoid drenching my night club garb.</p><p>Wolfgang finished his set in an hour with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q">Wolfgang Gartner - Undertaker</a>, then exited the stage to make way for <b>David Guetta</b>.  David Guetta is a horrible sellout producer who doesn't know how to DJ.  He can sequence songs, but everyone can do that these days.</p><p>He got up on stage and starting blaring the most generic EDM.  It was probably some track he's known for.  The words "Nothing but the beat" scrolled on the LCD display, so that can probably ID the song.  As the song built, he constantly interrupted the track by telling the crowd how this is his biggest gig in Chicago, and how we're all lucky, or whatever.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>As soon as the generic beat dropped, I took off.  I don't need to hear this.  Also, the weather was quite nauseating.  It was 90 some degrees with absolutely NO wind, so all the cigarette smoke stayed around the entire crowd.  From the setting, you'd think the were blowing smoke machines, but it was all disgusting cigarettes.  The worst smell in the world, coupled with some of the most horrible sounds in the world.</p><p>So, I left and went to Lou Malnati's for my favorite Chicago pizza, before heading back downtown for Zabiela's after party.</p><div class='title'><b>James Zabiela @ Sound-Bar</b></div><p>After eating a whole deepdish pizza, I took off for downtown and made it to the Sound-bar line around 11pm.  I was met by a line around the block, and it took about 50 minutes to make it into the club.  I finally made it in around Midnight, and had to pay a $10 cover, but it was worth it.</p><p>Sound Bar was exactly how I remembered it.  This place had not changed in the last 7 years.  Speakers lined the entire dance floor, so no matter where you were, you were standing in the best spot to hear the music.  And it is loud.  SO LOUD.  But the music is still crystal clear.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp"  /></p><p>As I entered, there was a couple in the booth tag teamin opening duties.  It was pretty cute, and they played some of the smoothest Prog House, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</a>.  The set already felt close to Sasha's Never say Never sound, but the plucked that one directly from his latest Usiaha set.  Man, I love that song.</p><p>Halfway through, the guy took over for a couple songs and ramped up the intensity.  One of the songs was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8">Moby - Raining again (Steve Angello Remix)</a>.  Once the girl got control of the decks, she seemed a little annoyed and quickly pulled it back into an amazing groove.</p><p>These two were pretty awesome.  I must know their names.  They continued until 1:30-ish, when James Zabiela took stage.  It took him a little while to set up his stuff, and around 1:45, he began.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>His set was incredible.  High energy, but not offense or pandering.  Several songs came from Sasha and John Digweed's playlist.  I recognized some of them, but the only one I could ID was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YtWG-qU1jw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YtWG-qU1jw">Layo &amp; Bushwacka - What do you say Now</a>.</p><p>He threw in plenty of effects on top of the normal tracks with his iPad, and some other toys.  And he played a couple break tracks LIVE too!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp"  /></p><p>I recorded the first hour and a half of his set, but stopped to take some pictures and enjoy his fantastic set.  Here's a link to the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0</a></p><p>Overall, this night was fantastic.  Last year, The Chemical Brothers rocked my world, and last night, it was James Zabiela.  It was definitely one of my top 5 music experiences of the year, alongside Sasha, Digweed, Shpongle, and OTT.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival Schedule" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-schedule">North Coast Music Festival Schedule</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Martin released the 4th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Feast for Crows, saying that originally it was too long!  A Feast for Crows was split into two books, and the next one should be out fairly soon.  5 years, all the fantasy nerds waited and waited and waited.  While it did take longer, the day is finally here.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp"  /></p><p>And Fuck me this book is huge.</p><p>As mentioned in my article a few days ago (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here!</a>), I finally started reading A Song of Ice and Fire as recommended to me by numerous friends,Â colleagues, and other random people.  And I've made the joke several times that each book in the series I read becomes the longest book I've ever read.  This is literally the case.</p><p>A Game of Thrones -- ~700 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Clash of Kings -- ~750 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Storm of Swords -- ~975 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Feast for Crows -- ~750 pages (hardcover)</p><p>I've only made it to A Storm of Swords at the moment.  I'm looking forward to A Feast of Crows which finally breaks the damn cycle.  But again...  Fuck me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp"  /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons -- 1040 pages (hardcover)</p><p>While these books have been described as addictive page turners, I find myself incredibly exhausted.  SO exhausted.  All the novels and books I've read before have been around the 200 or 250 park mark, with one or two hitting 300.  The last time I had a reading binge, I think I read 7 or 8 books before my motivation began to die.  Given that I'm almost 200 pages into A Storm of Swords after finishing the first two books, I think I've hit my limit :(</p><p>These books just keep going on and on and on and on.  There are two main stylistic choices that George R. R. Martin has chosen for A Song of Ice and Fire, and he is utterly stuck with these choices.</p><div class='title'><b>Character Focused Chapters</b></div><p>At first, A Song of Ice and Fire is written in third person.  Each chapter is named after a character in the story, and each chapter focuses on specific events surrounding that character.  As the story progresses, the third person take becomes more of a first person perspective written in third person.</p><p>This is good for me, as I have difficultly establishing connections to characters when everything is written in third person.  A first person story gives me information about the character's thoughts behind the action, and allows me to understand why the character is doing what they're doing.  A Song of Ice and Fire goes to great lengths to make this possible, but in the third person writing style.</p><p>A Game of Thrones is a fantastic book where things happens in one character's perspective, and then the view changes to another character and you get the other side of the story.  You get all (most) sides of the story and begin to understand that there are no villians in the story.  Each character has their motivation, and are completely consistent in what they do.  It all makes sense.</p><p>This style works well when all the characters occupy the same space.  But, it falls apart in the second and third novels when all the chapter-characters are separated, and all have their own plots.  While A Clash of Kings does have an overall plot, several characters are not participating in that plot.  Main characters are now side characters.  ...but they're still treated as main characters since they have their own chapters.  Each chapter begs for my attention, but so much of what's going on doesn't really matter.  My interest is split up into 7 or 8 concurrent storylines going on at once.</p><p>This is why I'm getting exhausted by these books.</p><div class='title'><b>Flashbacks</b></div><p>Flashbacks are good, but they aren't so good when they're used to play catch-up.  Unfortunately, while I'm reading about one character's plot, shit is still going on in the world to the other characters.  So how do we make up for this?  Start off a character's chapter with a flashback explaining what they were doing while you were reading about the other characters.</p><p>That's really what I was going for with my previous post (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here, again!</a>).  It's hard to advance the story of a character when you have to make up for all time you missed covering the other characters.  The present timeline of the chapter seems to hang there.  The story usually catches up halfway through the chapter, THEN we can doing stuff in present time.</p><p>While it IS annoying, It's pretty seemless how he integrates most flashbacks into the character's chapters.  But overall, it really seems like a side-effect to doing character focused chapters to begin with.  I think the suggestion I've heard the most from people complaing about this is that he should've just made a book all about Bran.  Then a book about Arya.  Then so on and on and on.  But TOO LATE, you're stuck with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Reading... ugh</b></div><p>Looking at my numbers above, there are 4215 pages to Song of Ice and Fire (at the moment).  And I've read about 1650 of them.  Nearly 40%!  I'll try to continue reading, especially now that my friends and colleagues have started diving into the new book.  But I don't think I can handle more than 100 pages a week.  Maybe I should start skipping certain chapters, and just read the cliff notes online...</p><p>Happy Dance with Dragons day, everyone!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I wrote about my excitement leading up to the event a few weeks ago --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">here</a>.</p><p>I wrote that after a couple of their sets were recorded from the previous weekend and starting floating around the Internet.  The Beta Nightclub set from June 16th, and their Electric Daisy Carnival set from July 18th.  Both were very similar, and had a very unique sound that proved Gabriel &amp; Dresden had returned.</p><div class='title'><b>Style</b></div><p>While technically they fall under the Trance genre, they play a lot of tracks all over the place.  One of key parts of their sound is incorporating the current sound of dance music into their sets and into their tracks.  So they'll throw in some Skrillex and Wolfgang with the vocals to their tracks and others on top of them.</p><p>Given those recorded sets from June, I figured that we would hear something similar in Chicago, and that was absolutely the case.  Like I nerd, I stood there and recorded the whole thing, and have posted it to youtube.  Even recording kinda seemed like redundant as those two other sets are much much better quality than what my camera could do.  But, at least it gives us the opportunity to get a tracklist of the entire night and maybe capture a few deviations.</p><p>Here's the youtube link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349</a></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>The tracklist was pretty easy to develop given the amount of overlap.

Zoe Johnston - No One On Earth (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix)</p><p>Leading into the weekend, Gabriel &amp; Dresden announced on Facebook that they were going to premiere a brand new song that they had just finished.  I think it's #22 on my list.</p><div class='title'><b>Duo</b></div><p>One thing that I found interesting about their performance was that they were both handling the controls during the entire night.  Both previous times I've seen G&amp;B in clubs, one of them would spin some discs, and halfway through the night, they'd switch.  Granted this was in 2004, back when they still had vinyl.</p><p>For Gabriel &amp; Dresden, I consider them to have 3 eras on distinct sound.  There's everything prior to 2004, 2004 to 2008 when they broke up, and their current sound in 2011 now that they've been reunited.  I wonder if they were spinning more as a concurrent duo towards the end in 2008, or if they were still separate as was the case in 2004.  Well, they definitely feel like a cohesive duo today. :)</p><div class='title'><b>The Mid</b></div><p>Overall, I had a great time.  Even though it was packed, it wasn't crotch-to-crotch packed, though some people seemed to think it was.  I still had room to move around, and rock out to the music.  Of course, I stayed in the exact same spot for 3 hours.  I didn't have to move through the crowds of people behind me.</p><p>The Mid has a very odd layout.  The dance floor is split up into two halves.  You have the front half in front of the stage that is completely clear and where all the dancing happens.  The back half, is completely roped off and filled with reserved tables for bottle service.  While, it seems perfect for those people who want to (or can) spend $500+ going to The Mid, and get a fantastic location in the club all to yourself, it's pretty horrible for us cheap (or budgeted) assholes who only pay for General Admission.  The reserved tables choke out the flow of human traffic from the back to the front.  The entire area surrounding that VIP is completely blocked off by bodies upon bodies of people trying to get somewhere else.  You have to shove your way through, basically.</p><p>But whatever, it's a nightclub.  If you want service or better treatment, shell out the cash.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Nook of Color" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color">A Nook of Color</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>"Excuse me, do you mind if I ask you which one that is?"</p><p>Everyday, busses enter Capitol Square in Madison, WI.  It's really the hub of all bus traffic in the city.  Whether they begin their journey there, or simply pass through is a matter of route.  Most busses arrive early, and must wait until their scheduled departure time.</p><p>Jim Hendricks waits at this bus stop every morning.  He walks from his apartment down the road, then waits for his bus to arrive.  This morning was really no different than any other.  The bus arrived on time and he boarded.</p><p>"It's a Nook Color", Jim replied.</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"A Nook Color," Jim replied again.  "From Barnes &amp; Noble."</p><p>"Ah yes...", the old man finally realized.</p><p>Today was a little different.  Someone on the bus actually talked to Jim.  Everyday, Jim waits for the bus, he boards, and now recently, he reads.</p><p>A few weeks ago premiered a television program that he was very excited for.  This program is called Game of Thrones.  It is based off of a series of novels that his college friends Tony of Gregerson and Erika of then Lamm, but now of Aho had implored him to read.  These friends were of like minds and tastes to Jim, and these books had captured their hearts.</p><p>"Game of Thrones is my favorite fantasy series.  All of his characters are rich, and his story doesn't care for them at all.  He kills of characters on a whim.  The story is brutal.  And you'd love it,"  Tony had stated.</p><p>"Yeah, Jim.  You should read them," Erika reinforced.</p><p>"I'm sure they're fantastic, but these books look really really long, and reading is boring," the young and naive Jim had replied to their recommendations.</p><p>It was 6 months and 5 years ago that Tony, in a further effort to expose Jim to these fantastic novels, had invited him to Madison.  The author, George R. R. Martin, had recently published A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in the series, and was on a book tour stretching from the salty seas of the Pacific to the Atlantic.  It was here that Jim met GRRM, shook his hand, purchased his books, and had them autographed.</p><p>But Jim was stubborn, and engulfed in course work at the time.  His stubbornness persisted even after university was completed, and began work in the midwestern city of Madison.  Many of his collegues had read the works, and shared their recommendations.  <em>Man, everyone loves these books.</em> But it was only until he saw the televised product that he began to head their words.  He and his friends watched in splendor as the distinct characters and vivid environments came to life.  After a few episodes, they were hooked.  They were fans.  And it was lucky that Jim owned the novels, so they all could read how it was originally wrote.</p><p>After 5 episodes had aired, Jim started reading Game of Thrones.  He had been discussing the program with Chris of Schroeder at his office.  <em>This show is pretty damn awesome, but there is a lot going on.  I really wonder how much of this stays true to the books.</em> So he read.  For the first time, in a long time, he read.  And of the recommendations, they were all justified.  For he did like the books.</p><p>"I really like it.  I bought it mostly for a vacation, and I've been using it quite a lot since then," he continued to reply to the old's man question on the bus.</p><p>Reading the novels had been great at first, but his yearly vacation across the seas to the volcanic Islands of Japan had drawn near.  He had a mere 200 pages remaining in Game of Thrones which he could surely finish given several hours.  <em>I'm just about done with this book, but I don't have to time before I leave.  I can't bring both books with.  They take up too much space.</em></p><p>He recalled a coversation he had with Lady Kait of Stites a week or two prior.  Though, he didn't recall the conversation perfectly as it had been at a bar, and Jim drinks many beers when he's at a bar.  He thinks this conversation was born out of talking about the band they at the bar to see.</p><p>"I find it odd how much I've completely switched to digital music.  I still feel like I'm one of those people who enjoys owning a physical copy of something.  But, ever since I bought this iPhone, I've stopped buying physical copies of music.  Almost everything is digital.  The only physical copies of music I purchase is Vinyl, as I feel that's the ultimate physical representation of music these days."</p><p>"Ya know, maybe books are the same way.  Having a first edition hardcover copy of book, is like having a vinyl copy of a vintage album.  And there are many books I don't care about but still want to read.  Maybe buying an ereader makes sense for those titles.  And portability too.  I'm going on vacation rather soon, and can't hulk around those mamoth tombs with me everywhere.  It makes sense to buy one of those things."</p><p>"Yeah, I could see that," Kait had replied, though probably just to humor him, as he was talking about boring things.  She smiled, and they went back to listening to the band.</p><p>A few days later, he found himself in Barnes &amp; Noble.  He was interested in the Nook Color above other ereaders for 3 key reasons.  The first was because of his hatred for e-ink.  e-ink was monotone and had an annoying lag between turning pages.  The second point had been it's OS built on Android.  There were several articles on tech blogs saying how easy it was to jailbreak the device, and find yourself with a full Android tablet.  Unlocked, it would be able to read any file format, read emails, looks at maps, translate Japanese.  The third point was the most important given the second point, the price.  It was only $250 for a easy-to-unlock tablet device designed as an ereader that could do much more.  After an hour of looking it over, and playing with it, he bought it.</p><p>He finished A Game of Thrones in transit to vacation.  Before returning from vacation, he was able to read over half of the second novel, The Clash of Kings.  Along with those novels, he packed several maps, an itinerary, a shopping list, and a Japanese dictionary on his Nook Color, and they were very helpful.  For this, he was grateful.</p><p>Back on the bus he relayed all of this information to the old man.  "So you can do a whole lot with it," the old man replied after a second of digesting what was just said.  Perhaps Jim had said too much information, and was probably boring people again.  They went back into silence.  Jim turned back to the Nook Color to continue reading.</p><p>He has started the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords and intends to read them all.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adventures in Tron" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adventures-in-tron">Adventures in Tron</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 31, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past Thursday, I was lucky enough to grab two tickets to an early screening of 20 minutes of the upcoming <b>Tron Legacy</b> film.  Despite being billed as "Tron Night", it really was just 20 minutes of the film.  They showed 5 scenes from the first half of the movie, and finished off with an extended trailer.</p><p>I'll describe each of the scenes, but first I'll refresh everyone's memory on what happened in the first movie.  I just finished watching it a minute ago, so it's all fresh in my mind.  Then I'll get into the new movie.</p><p><b>Tron</b> </p><p>(Spoilers from Tron 1)</p><p>First off, there's <b>Kevin Flynn</b>, as played by Jeff Bridges.  He's the most notable and iconographic character in the Tron universe.  In <b>Tron</b>, Kevin Flynn is a genious video game designer working for ENCOM.  All of his work was stolen by <b>Edward Dillinger</b>, played by David Warner.  Dillinger took all the credit of Flynn's genious, and quickly rose the ranks to a top executive position.</p><p>Meanwhile, Flynn hides out in his arcade.  Many of the games produced by ENCOM line his walls.  After hours, he relentlessly hacks ENCOM's server to find definite evidence of Dilliger's misdeeds.</p><p>The fantasy world inside the computer represents programs as their human users.  Flynn's program is named CLU.  In the first couple scenes of Tron, CLU is captured by security drones and erased by <b>Master Control</b>, locking Flynn out of the ENCOM mainframe.</p><p>Master Control Program is that spinny red cylinder face guy.  MCP is an artificial intelligence set to control most of the company's assets.  When Dillinger tries to take control back from MCP, MCP backmails him into complying.</p><p>Anyways, destroying CLU also locks out <b>Alan Bradley</b>, whose program is named Tron.  Tron is a security protocol set to monitor and regulate Master Control.   There's also a girl named <b>Lora Baines</b>, who works on a laser that dematerializing objects into the mainframe.  Why?  I dunno.</p><p>So, Alan and Lora run off to Flynn's Arcade to warm him that ENCOM has found out about his hacks, and they all hatch a plan to break into the ENCOM building and hack the servers from inside.  Alan goes back to his cubical and waits for communication from Tron, while Lora escorts Flynn to her laser lab to use her computer.  Lora runs off somewhere, and Flynn starts hacking away at the mainframe to find the evidence.  Meanwhile, MCP notices that Flynn is sitting at a terminal in clear sight of the dematerializing laser, so he zaps Flynn into the Matrix.</p><p>Inside the mainframe, we're introduced to <b>Sark</b>, who is Dillinger's program.  If MCP were The Emperor, Sark who be Darth Vader.  His loyal foot soldier who does all the evil deeds without reserve.  Sark gathers up spare and discarded programs and forces them to fight each other in <b>Games</b>.</p><p>There's a little bit of religion stuffed into the plot, as MCP's method of subjugating other programs is dispelling all knowledge of Users.  Some programs believe them to exist, but it's only a legend.</p><p>Flynn is himself when he's inside the mainframe, and meets up with programs that resemble his pals in real life.  Tron resembles Alan.  Lora's program, <b>Yori</b>, resembles her.  They all journey to defeat MCP and restore peace from his tyranny.  Also, throughout the adventure, Flynn figures out he has "god-like" powers over the mainframe because he's a User.</p><p>Spoiler Alert, they defeat Sark and MCP at the end of the movie.  Flynn gets zapped back to real life, and he recovers the evidence he needs to take down Dillinger.  The last scene of the movie shows Flynn flying in on a helicopter and assuming his role as CEO of ENCOM.  HAPPY ENDING!</p><div class='title'><b>Tron Legacy Setup</b></div><p>Fast forward, 28 years later to today, and we have Tron Legacy.  Tron Night showed us 5 scenes from the finished film.  And the first one reiterated what we already know about the initial plot of the film.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 1</b></div><p>The Scene starts with <b>Samuel Flynn</b> returning to his garage home somewhere in the city.  Sam Flynn is son of Kevin Flynn, and he's 27 years old.  <b>Alan Bradley</b> enters the scene and says something like, "That was some stunt you pulled today," referring to some hijinks Sam pulled at ENCOM.  It's been 20 years since Kevin Flynn has mysteriously disappeared, and Sam is agressivly reluctant to take over ENCOM in his father's place.</p><p>Sam tells Alan to fuck off, and Alan is all like "some day you'll understand."  Before leaving, Alan mentions he received a page last night.  The last thing that Flynn said to Alan was to keep the pager at all times, and when the time comes, you'll get further instructions.  The instructions were to go to Flynn's Arcade.  Alan suggests that Sam revisit that abandoned arcade and investigate.</p><p>Next we see Sam riding to the Arcade.  He goes inside and looks around.  He finds a secret passageway behind the Tron arcade game, which leads to a secret room with computers and a dematerializing laser.  Sam starts typing away at the computer, and runs the last instruction, which zaps him into the computer.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 2</b></div><p>The preview skips ahead a little bit to the point where Sam is caught by security drones and brought to central processing with a couple other stray programs.  JUST LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE, Sam is sent to the pit and readied to be in <b>The Games</b>.  He's given his disc-thingy, and then pushed off somewhere.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 3</b></div><p>Sam finds himself in a multi-staged arena.  There's about 8 fights going on.  All are 2 player matches between programs using their discs as weapons.  Sam learns pretty quick that this is a fight to the death, when he sees a victory in another ring.  His "Oh my god what's going on" defense quickly turns into an inexperienced but calculated win as he blows away the ground underneath his opponent.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 4</b></div><p>Oh, I guess Sam has escaped with the help of a masked program.  They're driving away in an all terrain vehicle, while security drones give chase in their light cycles.  They kill a couple drones, but more continue pursuit.  They reach a cliff and go off the end of it into rough unkept terrain which light cycles cannot follow.  They've escaped!</p><p>The masked hero reveals herself to be <b>Quorra</b>, but doesn't mention her importance in the story.  The reach an outpost in the barren wasteland, and go inside.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 5</b></div><p>Quorra brings Sam into a room to reunite him with Flynn.  After they exchange a bunch of heartfelt words, Flynn says something about what's going on, but I don't remember what it was because I had no frame of reference at the time.  I don't think it was much to go on anyways.  </p><p>Also, he calls Quorra his apprentice.  And Flynn has a custom version 1.0 Light Cycle in his room that Quorra says is still the fastest vehicle on the grid.</p><div class='title'><b>Trailer</b></div><p>Right when I thought they were going to unveil more of the overall plot, it was over.  At the end of Scene 5, it goes into the Daft Punk trailer posted to youtube earlier last week.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U">Youtube!</a></p><p>The footage in the first half of the trailer we had already seen that night from the actual scenes, but they added some extended cuts of fight scenes and light cycle chases.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Going into the preview, I hadn't seen Tron in forever, and only knew that Flynn had disappeared in the Matrix and his son goes after him.  Plot-wise, I was hoping to find out more about why Flynn went back into the computer, and what was going on.  There was none of that.  I exited the theater having gained no knowledge of Tron Legacy at all, which was incredibly disappointing.  I really can't form a decent opinion about the movie if I have no idea where it's going.</p><p>But it's definitely pretty.  Really damn pretty.  The preview was in 3D, and I really liked how it wasn't 3D at all in real life, but was completely 3D inside the computer.  It made for a fun transition.</p><p>If you've seen any trailer, or even watch the youtube I posted above, the look of Tron Legacy is gorgeous.  I love the art direction.  All the environments have this luminescent tint outlining their structure against a black surface.  Everything is crisp and clean, like everything is made of glass.  And the 3D effects ephasize the glassy translucent look of everything.  It's marvelous.</p><p>That's really why I'm into this movie.  The first moment I saw how everything looked, I was hooked.  And that's really what Tron has been about since the beginning.  The highest praise Tron ever got was that it was really damn pretty.  "A Technological Achievement."  </p><div class='title'><b>As a movie, it was Okay, but it didn't suck.  That's really the kicker.  Tron Legacy just needs an Okay story underneath to keep itself from ruining the marvelous visuals.</b></div><p>It might need something else though...</p><div class='title'><b>Tron's Legacy</b></div><p>Tron is not an easy movie to find.  Netflix does not have it on Instant Streaming, AND it no longer offers the discs.  If you turn to Half.com and Ebay, you'll only find copies of the DVD going for much more than you'd spend on a DVD these days.  They haven't released it on Bluray, but I expect the probably will when Tron Legacy does.</p><p>I watched it by downloading a torrent, but it ended up having an Italian dub over the dialogue.  Thank God the story isn't that complicated.  I knew what was going on thanks to Wikipedia's synposis.</p><p><b>I think having detailed knowledge of what was going on in the first movie is pretty important to understanding everything in Tron Legacy.</b>  Otherwise, the visuals won't be enough to dazzle you, and the movie will fall flat.</p><p>If you haven't seen Tron since you were a kid, name 3 or 5 things you remember from the film.  These things would probably include Jeff Bridges, Light Cycles, Disc Throwing, the Big Red Spinning Head Thing, and the whole landscape inside of the computer.</p><p>You probably don't remember the part about CLU dying at the beginning.  Or why or how Flynn even got into the computer.  Or that Flynn never uses his Disc once, in fact I think he drops it halfway through the film.  Or that Tron is a security program.  Or who Alan Bradley is.</p><p>Anyways, Good Luck finding a copy of Tron to watch.  You can't even go to Blockbuster now.  Maybe Family Video might have a copy?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-awakening">The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 20, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i>Update on March 22nd, 2014</i></p><p>Here are some photos I took from The Spring Awakening on March 20th, 2010 at The Congress Theater in Chicago.</p><p>Before The Spring Awakening blew up in the massive multi-day festival it is today, it started as a simple one night event.  Spring Awakening 2010 was the last one night event, they did before skipping 2011, and having the 2-day festival in 2012.  More on that one here: <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">July 21st, 2012</a>.</p><p>The Headlining lineup for 2010 was <b>Above & Beyond</b>, <b>Benny Benassi</b>, and <b>Second Sun</b> (Live).</p><p>Five and I went there together.  We arrived as opener <b>DJ BeBe</b> was finishing his set.  <b>Erik K</b> took over the opening duties soon after.  Both were fantastic openers. :)</p><p><b>Second Sun</b> were next, and they performed a great live set of their songs.  <b>Benny Benassi</b> was next.  I had not heard his music prior to the night.  He played some rather interesting tracks that really set his set apart from anything I had heard before.  Crazy drops and breaks in the atmosphere.</p><p>But, after seeing them in 2009, I was super excited to see <b>Above & Beyond</b>, and also introduce them to Five. :)  I felt like their 2009 performance at Epic was much more "magical".  At Epic, they felt much more connected to the crowd.  The Congress was just way too big to make that connection.  But they still were fantastic.  Here are thoughts on that event: <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">November 23rd, 2009</a>.</p><p><br/>Here are videos I took of the whole evening: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6</a><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/7">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/5">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
