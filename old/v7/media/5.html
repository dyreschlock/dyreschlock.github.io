| February 19, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, Gabriel & Dresden visited Chicago and put on an amazing performance that spanned genres, and eras.  At one point in time, Gabriel & Dresden were my absolute favorite trance group.  Their mixes were beautiful, melodic, layered, and sounded like nothing else, but I don't think they liked being restricted to a single genre.</p><p>Last year, I wrote a post about all of this: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">June 23rd, 2011</a>.  As time went on, they adapted their style towards the change in EDM.  They always featured some of the best tracks, and presented them with their own sound.  Their sound was as reactionary, as it was trendsetting amongst some Trance DJs.  I had always viewed them as curators of EDM, with an added focus on Trance.</p><p>After a 3 year break, they reunited last year with a slightly different sound than what people were used to.  It had a harder edge.  There was mainstream Trance tracks, some popular "House" tracks, and Dubstep tracks filling in some gaps, which was mashed up for consistent flow.  Plenty of fans complained about the change in style, but these people fail to realize that this is exactly what they've always done.  They've never been straight up trance.  (except for, maybe, at the beginning)</p><div class='title'><b>Last Year</b></div><p>Last year, they stopped by Chicago on <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid" title="/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">July 9th</a>, and performed a set nearly identical to others that had been broadcasted, recorded, and hosted online.  It was exactly what I wanted, but it had no surprises.  At that time, I think they were trying to get the word out there.  They built up a fantastic cache of mash ups, and remixes, and were ready to use them effectively in a city near you.</p><p>Fair enough.  They ended up using all those track to form an mix album, which was released on Armada towards the end of summer last year.</p><p>Today...  It's been a year since they've gotten back together, and they haven't been nearly as self-promoting as they were after the reunion.  I definitely wanted to see them again, and see what has changed, what they've learned, and how they've adapted to the rapidly changing landscape of EDM.</p><div class='title'><b>Last Night!</b></div><p>And they have adapted.  Last night, Dave Dresden and Josh Gabriel spun for a little over 3 hours.  And started off with some somewhat heavy tracks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp"  /></p><p>I caught the first 40 minutes on video, which you can find here:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU</a></p><p>They started off with a mashup of Beautiful Things, and went into some heavy tracks.  45 minutes into the set, they started shifting focus a little bit, and started playing a lot of their tracks from last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp"  /></p><p>I definitely heard the following tracks:</p><p>- Andain - Promises (Gabriel & Dresden Remix)<br/>- Motorcycle - As The Rush Comes (DJ Kue Remix)<br/>- Clashback vs. Michael Woods vs. R.E.M. - Losing My Outset (Gabriel & Dresden Mashup)<br/>- Josh Gabriel pres.

They played the obligatory Sun & Moon track, but started going deep into their pockets to give us a full out fan service retrospective.  And they even played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPGIrFdquF8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPGIrFdquF8">James Holden - Nothing</a>!

I've now seen them twice after their reunion, and the other times were in 2004 when I was WAY into them.  Oddly enough, the first time I saw them live was February 28th, 2004, almost 8 years ago exactly.  And I wrote about that experience as well.  Be prepared, as it is very horribly written --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/chi-town" title="/chi-town">Click!</a>.  I took a lot of <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago">pictures</a>, too.</p><p>I met some people from the Trance Addict forum in real life, and we had a meet and greet with Gabriel & Dresden at a bar down the road.  It was awkward, hilarious, and insightful.  As that post states, Josh Gabriel explained that he thinks of sounds in the form of textures, and used the feel of a song for his composing and mixing.</p><p>I think that rings true today, as their recent sets continue to flow just as well as the ones back in the day.  In fact, I think their sets from the last year are more cohesive than the ones they played leading into their break up.  Sure, plenty of the tracks are popular, but it's never a jolting experience when it's mixed in.  They've edited and mashed the songs to fit their style, so it's consistent with both the original track and their sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Final Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I'm glad to see these guys continue to dominant.  I was a little scared when they hadn't been promoting as much these days, but they are far from dormant.  I'm sure we just got a taste of their upcoming performance(s) at WMC next month, and I can't wait to see what they have down the road.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 6 Finale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-6-finale">Dexter Season 6 Finale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My friends and I just finished the most recent season of Dexter, season 6, last night and was a lot better than any of us expected.  After the lack of direction nor interesting characters in Season 5, we were mostly turned off from the series.  But we picked it up, watched it, and glad we did. :)</p><div class='title'><b><em>Spoilers!</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Season Arcs</b></div><p>I think the reason Season 6 pretty well is that we have an actual fleshed out character as a villain with clear motivation, and actually does plenty of murder throughout the Season.  Seasons 1 and 4 did this perfectly and stand as the best two seasons of the show.  Seasons 2, 3, and 5 strayed away from this and fall very flat as a consequence.</p><p>I think that Season 2 had a pretty tight focus, but the villain was basically Dexter.  Unless you count Lyla, but she wasn't a serial killer at all.  She's just a crazy bitch, which was more of a manifestation of Dexter's dark side.  I think that the suspense of Dexter being caught makes up for the lack of a strong villain, but there still isn't a whole lot of murder going on.</p><p>Season 3 is the absolute worse.  We do have a serial murderer, but he has no character at all.  They never wrote him that way.  He's just a dude who skins people.  Who is he?  I dunno.  Jimmy Smitts as the Season's actual villain, but he's not really a serial killer.  He's just a controlling asshole, and the whole season focuses on that.  Who cares?  Get to the killing.</p><p>Season 4 felt incredibly fresh after the horror of Season 3.  Dexter is out killing again, and his kills actually show his character, and he grows.  I wrote about all that while the season first aired: <a href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4" title="/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">October 20th, 2009</a>.  But we have a clear villain, who does a lot of murder.  Dexter learns from the clues and tracks him down, while the police are closing in as well.  And there's an epic showdown.</p><p>With the story they had laid out for Season 5, I think it was doomed for failure.  They had to deal with the aftermath of Season 4, while still spinning their own plot.  Well, they couldn't just focus on grief the entire season, so they needed to throw a villain in their, too, somehow.  And maybe a love plot, too?  Whatever...  This season focused more on Season 4, rather than itself, and suffered because of it.</p><p>With Season 6, they were able to start fresh.  A brand new villain, with a clear motive, and their story focused on throughout the season.  It was fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>I think they learned from Season 4 a little too much.  If you end with a massive cliffhanger, you instantly pull in the audience and make them care far more than the normally would.  I'm guessing that Season 5 Episode 1 had the highest amount of ratings of any single Dexter episode thanks to the ending of Season 4.  And I expect Season 7 Episode 1 to pull in some serious ratings as well.</p><p>Currently, Dexter is signed on through Season 8.  I expect them to actually finish off the show at Season 8, but who knows what'll happen.</p><p>Also, I expect Season 7 to be somewhat similar to Season 5, but perhaps with a Season 2 edge.  It won't be as sappy, or mistake ridden as Season 5 because Dexter isn't some vulnerable lost sheep.  But the writers still have to deal with the aftermath.  In Season 5, they wrote out almost everything that had to do with Rita, Aster, and Cody, and just moved forward.</p><p>I don't think they can ignore Deb, but I wouldn't put it past them to write her as understanding and accepting.  Which is the complete opposite of what she would actually do.  They have a chance to actually end on a high note, and write an interesting drama filled plot between these two characters, but I fully expect them to fuck it up.</p><p>Who knows...  In any case, I'm fully invested in this show again thanks to Season 6. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis-2">Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 5, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been almost 2 1/2 years since Above &amp; Beyond performed in Minneapolis.  As they took the stage, right before midnight on Saturday, their gigantic LED display started off by saying, "Minneapolis, it's been too long."</p><p>Currently, on tour for their new artist album, <b>Group Therapy</b>, Above &amp; Beyond have visited a lot of lesser known clubs.  I think they intend to have another North American tour later in the year to all the American clubbing hot spots.  They've completely skipped over New York and Florida.  And have found themselves in Indiana, Ann Arbor, St. Louis, and plenty of Canadian areas too.</p><p>I was there in November 2009 when they took the stage and completely reopened my dormant thoughts about the good 'ol days of Trance.  All of their tracks were beautiful, melodic, and completely uplifting.  I was smiling all night.  <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Read all about it!</a></p><p>Last night was a little different though :/</p><p>A lot has changed in Electronic Dance Music over the past 2 years.  Electro House and Dubstep (and other) producers and DJs have brought the music genre into the mainstream, and popularity is currently at a ridiculous high.  Above &amp; Beyond have continued to capture the attention of old fans while still raking in new ones.  Which made for quite a crowded site.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp"  /></p><p>I've seen Epic (or The Quest) more crowded than it was last night, and still had a fantastic time.  But the crowd was a different beast than what I expect from Minneapolis.  Almost every time I've attended a DJ event in Minneapolis, the crowd is friendly.  They'll give you space, smile at you when you're dancing around, and be quite courteous and mindful of others.</p><p>Kids these days...  It's all pushing and shoving, and crowding out others while making more space for yourself.  Or maybe it's because it feels like the true fans of Minneapolis are STARVED for the type of music that pioneered the scene in the first place.  Now, if a remotely decent international DJ finally makes their back way to Minneapolis, every one remoted interested shows up, nerd or not.  Not to mention the #5 DJ Act in the world, Above &amp; Beyond.</p><p>I expect this kind of behavior from the crowds in Chicago, but Minneapolis?  And at a Trance show?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp"  /></p><p>Crowd mentality wasn't the only that has changed since the last time.</p><p>In order to stay relevant, Above &amp; Beyond have adapted to the changes in the EDM landscape with their own sound.  They have somewhat shifted away from the uplifting melodic sounds that blew me away 2 1/2 years ago, to more mainstream modern day trance, ala Armin van Buuren.  Their huge single last year, Sun &amp; Moon, is a perfect example of keeping some hints of melody while totally succuming to hard Trance beats.</p><p>I was very very hopeful, when they began their set with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c">Above &amp; Beyond - Filmic</a>, which is a beautiful track, but it turned into modern trance shortly after.  I was keeping track of everything they played, but it was pretty damn close to the Data Trasmission Podcast ep 200, and their Essential Mix last year.</p><p>Actually, one thing about those two mixes that I found absent in their set last night was the addition of some breaky tracks, or, at least, some breaky soundy tracks.  While the mixes were still modern day trance, it was refreshing to hear some of that mixed into it.  I don't recall hearing any of that last night.</p><p>Blah blah blah, complain complain complain... If I had picked up their new CD and listened to it a little more, I would have certainly been more prepared for modern day Above &amp; Beyond.  They should get Ocean Lab back together and make a follow up to Sirens of the Sea!</p><p>They did play On a Good (Metropolis) Day. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp"  /></p><p>I went up to Minneapolis with Fishy and Five.  Five had a great time.  He's more into the modern day Trance sound than I am, so he was absolutely in heaven the whole time.  Fishy was hopping around with her glue sticks (when we actually had a room), and attracted random people here and there.  Also, I was able to meet up with a childhood friend of mine, so the night turned out pretty great. :)</p><p>Once the night finished, Above &amp; Beyond exited the stage and raced back to the merch booth.  They blew right past Five as Jack Trash announced they're signing stuff at the merch booth.  Five turned around and was first in line for signed shit!  So, he picked up a $4 tour poster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp"  /></p><p>Only Paavo and Tony were signing things, though.  The third member, Jono, was not back there.  Actually, I never saw Jono on stage either.  Maybe he was waiting in the bus, or something.</p><p>Also, if you noticed the tour dates on that schedule, Minneapolis was the last stop on a 12-day concert binge for them.  Today was their first day off since last Tuesday.  And these 12 dates are almost the entire tour.  That's pretty crazy.  Though, I suppose if you have 3 members and only 2 of them are up on stage doing the work, it's not so bad.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/reuben-wu-of-ladytron-segredo-madison">Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They have negotiated a monthly (?) residency with Chicago local Dani Deahl, and they were able to get Reuben Wu from one of my favorite bands, Ladytron.  Rather than rescheduling, they just decided to role with it and have them both perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp"  /></p><p>Opening up for them were locals DJ Nick Nice and Mike Carlson.  Mike Carlson played a rather ridiculous set.  I think he fit almost every popular electronic dance genre into his set.  House, Techno, Electro, Electro House, Dubstep, Trance, and a little Acid House.  I (my phone) caught a couple of the tracks.</p><p>Steve Angello - Knas<br/>Freestylers - Cracks (Flux Pavilion Remix)<br/>Wolfgang - Illmerica<br/>Knife Party - Internet Friends<br/>Deadmau5 - Some Chords (i think?)</p><p>I though everything actually worked out quite well. Â Despite spanning all these genres, the whole set was pretty cohesive, and made sense.  It was rather interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dani Deahl</b></div><p>Dani Deahl took over a little bit before midnight.  She seems to have a lot of fans around the Midwest, and doesn't mind traveling up to Wisconsin to plays shows in Madison, or Milwaukee.  I've seen her before, opening up for JFK at The Mid.  That opening set was ok.  It didn't really seem like she was having much fun.  She was holding back.  She had to hold back, being a warm-up DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp"  /></p><p>Last night, she was able to completely let loose, and her set was fun for the most part.  She threw in several popular songs, but had an array of a few deeper tracks that really ripped up the crowd.  Here's some tracks I caught:</p><p>Calvin Harris - Awooga<br/>that Steve Aoki song<br/>iPhone marimba tone<br/>Swedish House Mafia - One</p><p>About halfway through her set, when she played that Steve Aoki song, I think things startedÂ deterioratingÂ for me.  And then she started throwing in more dubstep, and some ridiculous songs choices, like that track with an iPhone marimba tone drop?  What's the purpose of that song?  There's no musical reason for it what so ever.  Is the crowd supposed to laugh and say, "hurrr, it's that sound my phone makes"?  I hate dubstep (brostep).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Reuben Wu</b></div><p>Reuben Wu started around 1, and begin putting Dani's set to shame.  I feel like he started off a little dry, but after a few quick songs he tore into the crowd with a much harder edge.  I recorded the first half hour of his set.  I think it starts getting pretty damn good at the 14 minute mark.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o</a></p><p>I'm not really sure what genre this would be.  It's kinda of a mix of Electro House and Techno, I think.  I'm glad I recorded it because as the night (and drinking) progressed, my memory becomes less effective.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp"  /></p><p>It always interesting to see members of the band spin shit on their own.  I wonder imagine they play music they enjoy and draw some inspiration from.  I don't think Reuben threw in popular tracks to get people to like him.  I think he was a building a set he enjoyed and made sense.</p><p>Also, there was a decent crowd for Dani Deahl as she was throwing down tracks, but after Reuben took the stage, people started to slowly exit the club.  By the end, I think Segredo went from 400+ people down to 100. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Mira Aroyo @ The Rave last year</b></div><p>Apparently, all the members of Ladytron met in clubs in London while DJing back in the day, so I was always interested to hear what that might have sounded like.  Last year in Milwaukee, Mira Aroyo, one of the lead singers, was in Wisconsin as well.</p><p>It was a very odd night.  The Rave shacked her up in one of the side rooms, rather than either main room.  Only 50-70 people showed up throughout the night.  Most of those people were probably friends with the opening DJs.  (and) Beers were stupid expensive because it's The Rave, and that place is garbage.</p><p>Mira's mixing wasn't all that great, and her track selection wasn't very inspired.  She'd play a couple tracks, and then pick a remix of a Ladytron song. Play a few more tracks, then Ladytron remix again.  And the other tracks she played were either Electro, or Electro House, or Dubstep.  Mostly popular stuff.  It wasn't very cohesive, and she failed to build any kind of vibe.  The 70ish people there never really danced, so it was just a bunch of people standing around.</p><p>It was pretty awkward to begin with, but the most awkward moment was when she ended her set.  The crowd applauded, but then DEAD silence.  Mira gave a "Thank you", people clapped again, and dead silence again.  It was the saddest DJ event I've ever been to.</p><p>I like Mira quite a bit though.  I think she's my favorite member of Ladytron.  But after last night, I think Reuben is now my (secret) favorite.  Mira's set was pretty shallow.  And Reuben definitely proved he knows how to take command of the decks.  I'd be real interested to hear Helen and Daniel spin a set, but I doubt I'll ever have a chance to see that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago">Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He has had a residency at Ushuaia Beach Hotel, and hosting an event called "Never say Never."  As he puts it, this is chance for him to play any music he wants.  No expectations, no reservations.  Just spin all the tracks that give him inspiration from artists he loves and admires.</p><p>As such, the style of music is a bit different than his semi-typical Progressive House tone.  It's more light, semi-upbeat and rich Tech House.  But the feel is still Sasha.  The first time I heard a Never say Never, it was really odd.  The mixing and atmosphere was absolutely Sasha, but the music was all different.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha MixMag CD</b></div><p>You can take a listen for yourself. :)</p><p>For the November Issue of MixMag magazine, Sasha had the honor of developing and releasing a mix for their monthly guest CD.  Leading up to the actual release of the issue, Sasha mentioned heading back to the studio after a summer of traveling and playing various gigs.  And out of that came a few new tracks, along with some edits, and wonderful arrangement.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp"  /></p><p>1.

Out of all the times I've Sasha over the last 10 years, i have NEVER seen his as energetic, on having as much fun, or generally happy to spin his tracks.  He was moving around in the booth all night, shaking hands with the happy people up front, and even gave out his headphones at the end of the night.  (He got them back, though, after he went up for 2 encores.)</p><p>Every other time I've seen him spin, he seems so into the vibe, and stoic that it's hard to tell if he's actually having fun.  Digweed is somewhat similar too.  They stand there the whole night, and build and build, layer and layer.  Perhaps they're too much into the technical aspects of mixing and set building to actually have fun?  Or maybe Sasha feels like he's being pigeon holed into a specific genre, and mixing in other stuff won't work with what he's already built.</p><p>But he was having the time of his life in the booth this night, and it completely fed the crowd.  For being as crowded as it was, everyone had a smile across their face.  Lots of hand shaking, high fives, and hugs.  Sasha's good vibes energized everyone there.</p><p>It was very different than the (semi) normal douchebaggery crowd that tends to show up to a Chicago club.  Maybe the horrible weather scarred them away.  Or maybe because the crowd was 80% dude, there weren't any chicks around to bring out the douchebag clubber within.  Or it could be a combination that resulted in actual Sasha fans braving the weather, and filling the majority of the club.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and was holding my camera in the air the whole time to capture the audio.

It's a remake of a classic 1960s film of the same name, and by famed director Takashi Miike, who has also done Osaka Tough Guys, Ichi the Killer, Audition, and many many more.  It seems like the guy does 3 or 4 movies a year.</p><p>The setting is in the mid 1800s as the feudal shogunate system was beginning to fail.  Samurai were losing their social power, and the Shogun were desperately trying to keep their ultimate power, while peasants were dying from starvation.</p><p>Lord Naratsugu was son of the Shogun, and committed horrible crimes against the people he reined over.  Killing entire families for fun, disemboweling women, and leaving them to die.  There was nothing legal to be done, so samurai Shinzaemon was summoned and ordered to kill him by a rival political party, before Naratsugu can gain more political power.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>Shinzaemon recruits 12 others, mostly samurai, and forces Naratsugu into a battle as he returns home from Edo.  Shinzaemon cuts off several routes, and lures Naratsugu caravan into a small rustic town, where the battle commences.</p><p>The setup, tone, and execution is very much like Seven Samurai.  The first half of the movie is recruiting and setting up the battle, while the second half is the entire battle itself.  13 Assassins pays great homage to Seven Samurai with the added benefit of being historical significant.  In Seven Samurai, the samurai simply protect a village against bandits.  In 13 Assassins, it's common Japanese samurai taking down the Shogun's son.</p><p>The greatest part of this movie is the very end when Shinzaemon and Naratsugu are set to battle each other, and Shinzaemon stabs Naratsugu through the gut with his Katana.  Naratsugu falls to the ground in pain, and suddenly realizes that he's not a god.  He's not some divine creature born to rule mortal men.  He IS a mortal man.  And now he's dying in a ditch, like a mortal man.</p><div class='title'><b>End Spoilers</b></div><p>I haven't seen the original, but Takashi Miike's 2010 adaption of 13 Assassin's is absolutely top notch.  It's one of the best Japanese films I've seen in a while.  And people seem to agree as it has a 95% on Rotten Tomatos, and won the award for Best Film from the Japanese Academy Awards.</p><p>You guys should definitely check this out.  It's on Netflix Instant Watch right now!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nick Warren, Hernan Cattaneo @ Sound-Bar" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago">Nick Warren, Hernan Cattaneo @ Sound-Bar</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Two of the very best in Progressive House, Two of the my favorite DJs, Two of my idols, Two legends, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo made a stop at Sound-Bar in Chicago on their brief USA tour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p>I have been a fan of Nick Warren not too long after I started really getting into Sasha.  Much like Sasha, he's a huge proveyor of a layered, building sound, but adds his own rich ambient flair to the mix.  It was his mix for Global Underground #24 that hooked me for life, though I think his set from <a href="http://hybridized.org/sets/839" title="http://hybridized.org/sets/839">Tonic in 2004</a> illustrates the vibe from that time much better.  His ambient sounds builds a warm, comfortable atmosphere, that builds throughout the night into massive energy.</p><p>Nick Warren is one-half of Way out West with Jody Wisternoff.  Way out West is responsible for some of the best and influential acid house, trance, and progressive trance hits over the last 15 years.</p><p>Nick has two radio shows.  He flexs his ambient sound on Frisky Radio every 2 months for Sound Garden.  And he has another show on Delta FM which he does every 2 months, also.  He usually posts them on his soundcloud page, so give 'em a listen: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren" title="http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren">http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren</a></p><p>For Hernan Cattaneo, I became a fan of his more recently.  His deep progressive house doesn't always resonate with me, but his live sets build an immense vibe that is unforgettable.  I missed his solo performance earlier this year at The Mid, so I was grateful to get another chance to see him so soon. :)</p><p>With Sasha and Digweed, I consider the 4 of them, the kings of Progressive House.  All of them are good friends, and tend to spin together at events.  They usually all get together for the bedrock boat cruise during the Winter Music Conference in Miami.</p><div class='title'><b>Sound Bar</b></div><p>Sound Bar did a horrible job promoting this event.  I only knew about it from Nick Warren's facebook page back in October.  Sound Bar said nothing about the event at all.  The promotion company, React, said nothing either despite promoting events into February already.  It wasn't until 2 weeks ago, when the event finally showed up on Sound Bar's webpage, and THEN react actually started promoting it.  So many people didn't even know this was going on until it was too late.</p><p>Sound Bar usually has a line around the block for weekend events, and there were only 4 or 5 groups of people in front of us when Five and I showed up a little bit before 11pm.  DESPITE that it still took 25 minutes to get into the building.  The lines bottleneck at the hostesses inside the door looking up names on the RSVP list.  They usually take about 3-4 minutes per person, unless you're a VIP or whatever.  She couldn't find my name, for some reason &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Throughout the night, Five and I went to the bar for some drinks.  Later in the evening, when I went to get some water, one of the bartenders was just talking with his friends off to the side not paying attention to the bar.  The other bartender was looking around at people, but didn't actually wait on someone until after 10 seconds of eye contact.  When she finally saw me, she started getting drinks for people right in front of her instead.  It was so bad for Five earlier in the night, that he just went downstairs to the other bar.</p><div class='title'><b>Progressive House</b></div><p>But all that annoying nonsense didn't matter when Nick and Hernan took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp"  /></p><p>They started spinning around 11:30pm!  Five and I had only just arrived, and they were already up!  I don't think I've ever been to a club in Chicago were the headliners started before Midnight.  AND they continued on until the end of the night.  Over 4 hours of pure Progressive House madness.</p><p>Nick started off with a couple smooth opening pieces, and gave the decks over to Hernan who followed it up with a deep vibe.  They continued this trend through out the night.  Nick would played 3-5 songs, and Hernan would follow up with another 3-5 songs, and it would go back to Nick.</p><p>Nick seemed to be leading the night.  His miniture 20 minute sets would start off smooth and continue to build and build and build until the entire dance floor erupted in crazy cheers and dance.  He'd give the decks back to Hernan and he would keep the vibe at the top of the room with a follow up 20 minute set.  It was absolutely nuts how raw the night was.  It kept building and keeping the level high all night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>I'm not as familar with the tracks Hernan was spinning, but I definitely caught a bunch of Nick's tracks from recent sets of his.  My favorite moment of the night was Nick mixing his track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_qufBb32A" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_qufBb32A">Rumbletump</a> into his other track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8">Buenos Aires</a>.  My second favorite moment of the night was Hernan when he dropped <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU">Guy J &amp; Henry Saiz - Meridian</a>.</p><p><b>Edit!</b> I was wrong.  It was Eelke Kleijn's remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuPHok0FgMk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuPHok0FgMk">Water Games</a> being mixed into Buenos Aires.  Still my favorite moment of the night, though.  I love both those songs :)</p><p>I recorded the first 3 hours of the night, which can be found on youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>It was an incredible rare ocassion that two of the biggest names in Progressive House teamed up for a unique massive event.  The entire crowd continued to rock out hard all night, and had nothing but smiles on their faces.  I think this is the first event I've ever been to in Chicago, where (pretty much) every one was getting along, and being friendly for a change.  Though, I think the nerds were in great attendance, so there weren't a lot of girls around on the dance floor messing everything up.</p><p>This was definitely the highlight of the year for me, and definitely in the top 5 music experiences of my life.  It's up there with Sasha from 2003, Hybrid in 2004, Junkie XL is 2004, and The Chemical Brothers last year.</p><p>Plus I got my copy of Global Underground 24 signed!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chuck Palahniuk's Damned Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-damned-tour">Chuck Palahniuk's Damned Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight, I was in Minneapolis for Chuck Palahniuk's second to last stop on his tour promoting his newest novel, <b>Damned</b>.  Damned is about a 13 year old girl, named Madison, who dies.  And she must accept the fact that she's dead, and goes through the grieving process.  Damned is the first book in a triology.  The following 2 books are still in process and titled <b>Doomed</b> and <b>Delivered</b>.  Apparently she goes from hell (Damned) to purgatory (Doomed) to heaven (Delivered).</p><p>I haven't had a chance to read Damned just yet, but it seems that Chuck and Double Day are promoting Damned much more than his other recent novels.  Perhaps that's because it's a series of books and they need to start strong.  Chuck has done interviews in many of the popular and niche magazines out there.  Including in an article for Minneapolis' own premiere newspaper, The Star Tribune.</p><p>My Mom was kind enough to clip the whole 2 page spread out of The Star Tribune for me.  Thanks Mom. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp"  /></p><p>The article was printed on Sunday November 6th, and was written by Star Tribune's art editor, Claude Peck.  You can probably find it on The Star Tribune dot com.  (edit: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/133204103.html" title="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/133204103.html">Here it is</a>).</p><p>Tonight's event for Chuck Palahniuk wasn't just another stop on the tour, but was part of a series of interviews with high-profile authors of our time.  The Star Tribune and Minnesota Public Radio collaborated on this series entitled <b>Talking Volumes</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Talking Volumes</b></div><p>Talking Volumes is held in downtown St. Paul at the historic Fitzgerald Theater, which is apparently the oldest theater in the Twin Cities (citation needed).  We got there around 5:30pm, and stood outside in line for a little while.  Upon entering the theater, we were given a program was reprinting the entire Star Tribune article in a much more focused format.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp"  /></p><p>To start off the evening, a woman came up on stage and gave an introduction to the events for the evening.  She give a quick rundown of MPR, and asked for donations (of course).  She brought Claude Peck to the stage, and asked him a few quick questions about the Star Tribune article.  Peck had flown out to Chuck's home in Portland, Oregon several weeks ago to do this "exclusive" interview, and were able to get some nice, current photos of Chuck in the process.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp"  /></p><p>And with that the woman introduced Kerri Miller.  Miller is the host of Talking Volumes, and a few other programs on MPR.  She's been in broadcasting since 1981, and used to be on KARE-11 news in Minneapolis before joining MPR in 2004.  She started off with a short introduction, and welcomed Chuck to the stage.</p><div class='title'><b>Interview</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp"  /></p><p>The interview was rather interesting and a little unorthodox.  Miller had a series of prepared questions, but would not disclose them with Chuck.  I'm guessing this is because they didn't want some prepared statement, or marketing answer for each question, but wanted the interview to be an actual interview.  This didn't really go over so well with Chuck.</p><p>For the first few questions, he had to pause for a moment to form the answer in his head.  I don't think that's because he didn't have an answer, but because he wanted to form the answer into something entertaining, funny, or memorable.  After a few answers like this, Miller asks why he felt the need to do this.  Chuck took no time in answering this one.</p><p>It was to put on a show, obviously.  When trying to be funny, or shocking, or memorable, the audience reaction is a clear sign that things are either going right, or wrong.  And having the chance to prepare, gives the opportunity to make the answers pop and excite.  Having to think up entertaining answers on the fly is difficult for anyone. And most of his answers came in the form of a story, or anecdote.  Some stories of which I had heard before.</p><p>She did ask some good questions though, and some of them got down to the fundamental themes brought forth in <b>Damned</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Death and Damned</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp"  /></p><p>Leading into the Summer of 2008, Chuck had just released <b>Snuff</b>, and was on tour promoting it.  I caught him in Minneapolis that time too!  Check it out = <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">May 27th, 2008</a>.</p><p>He mentioned that Snuff was the first of faux "trilogy" he had written during the previous year while his mother laid in the hospital.  He visited her constantly, and while in her hospital room, he would write.  And what came out of that was Snuff, Pygmy, and Tell-All.  Each of these books were very research focused, and seemed like flushed out short stories.</p><p>In the Fall of 2008, the film based on his novel Choke was released in theaters, and he was up and about again with promoting the film.  Chuck mentioned that he had this very odd juxtaposition of promoting a movie about a Son visiting his dying mother in the hospital, while doing this exact same thing with his own mother in his personal life.  He kept all this somewhat private, at the time.  Shortly after the Choke was release, his mother passed away.</p><p><b>Damned</b> is a trilogy for him strictly dealing with the death of his mother, and the death of his father from 12 years ago.  He mentioned that writing a novel about a 49 year old man, dealing with the death of his parents is way too sad.  So he completely switched the situation to be a young girl dealing with her own death, and missing her parents, her friends, her life.  She's mourning herself, in the same way others would mourn the loss of her.  And she mourns the loss of her parents, because she's dead.</p><p>Damned sounds much more down to earth than his previous couple of novels.</p><div class='title'><b>Being Clever</b></div><p>The night was split up into 3 segments, with each one broken up by a musical break by surf rock band, The Bombay Sweets.  The first two segments were strictly for the interview, and each segment ended with Chuck reading an excerpt from Damned.  For the third segment, Miller opened the floor to questions from  the audience.</p><p>I think Chuck responded to the audience questions with much more enthusiasm than he did with any of the questions by Miller.</p><p>One question was about the scene in the <b>Fight Club</b> film, when Brad Pitt first meets Edward Norton on the airplane.  They have a little conversation, and Norton explains his whole single serving theory of travel.  Brat Pitt replies, "That's clever."  Norton returns, "Thank You."  Pitt continues, "How's that working out for?" Norton , "What?"  Pitt, "Being clever."</p><p>The question was how did he come up with that dialogue, and was there a story behind it.  Chuck professed that it was actually Brad Pitt that came up with that line during filming, and he had nothing to do with it.  But Chuck added to the answer by saying that being witty and clever can really only get you so far.  Witty and Clever are good ways of getting in the door, but you need something more to really hook your audience.</p><p>You need to create something memorable.  Not necessarily something that audience will like, but something that will make an impact. If something impactful happens to you, whether you like it or not, several months or years down the road, it will still be with you.  And at that time, you'll respond to it favorably.  You'll like it then.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Obedient, The Rebel, The Witness</b></div><p>Another question that was asked had Chuck talking about a very common literary and story telling/writing pattern that emerged in the 20th century.   The idea of the Obedient, the Rebel, and the Witness.</p><p><b>The Obedient</b> is a person who follows the rules perfectly. Society has told them that if you follow these rules, all of your desires will come true. Get good grades in School. Listen to their teachers. Graduate. Go to college. Get a degree. Get a job. Get married. Have kids.  Et cetera.</p><p>Everyone my age was subliminally told this as a child.  And that is how I've followed my life for the most part.  And it's worked out pretty well for me.  It doesn't really work out this way for everyone, though.</p><p>Following this pattern will eventually lead to self-destruction.  In many of these stories, this person is seen as the Martyr.  They do everything in their life "perfectly", but it's not true.  It's not perfect.  And then they fall.  In real life, they fall into the next archetype.</p><p><b>The Rebel</b> is the complete opposite.  They reject everything society has taught them, and follow their own rules.  They feel that society has failed them, or that society has nothing to offer them, or that society is a fraud.  In stories, this person is eventually killed by society.  It's impossible (not really) to live outside of the system, and that system will eventually roll over them, and reject them.</p><p>Most Obedient people will turn rebel when their hopes and dreams are dashed by following the rules.  "The system lied to me."  In our lives, we usually glide back and forth between the two extremes.  We don't like to live in the system, but the system is there for a reason, and it's comfortable.  But FUCK the system.</p><p>The point directly between the Obedient and the Rebel is <b>the Witness</b>.  They are the person who has seen both ends of the spectrum.  They take this knowledge with them.  They are wise because of it, and can guide others through their life.</p><p>Chuck gave some examples of this story telling pattern being used.  Stories such as Gone with the Wind, and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.  In One Flew, Billy Bibbit is the Obedient, McMurphy is the Rebel, and Big Chief is the Witness.</p><p>Chuck mentioned that he incorporated this pattern in <b>Fight Club</b>, but put all these roles in a single character.  The Narrator is the Obedient.  Tyler Durden is the Rebel.  And both of characters types are eventually killed, leaving the Narrator as the Witness.  Marla is possibly the Witness, too.</p><div class='title'><b>End of Interview</b></div><p>At the end of the Interview, Chuck had a little contest to see who could blow up Inflatable pumpkins the fastest and knock them into the sky.  So, the whole theater inflated these things, and started punching them around the place.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp"  /></p><p>The interview was recorded, and will air on MPR sometime in the next week, I'm guessing.  It was video recorded too, so be sure to check out MPR's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MPRdotOrg" title="http://www.youtube.com/user/MPRdotOrg">Youtube channel</a> for updates on that.</p><p>I came away from the night with a pre-signed copy of Damned, which included several "Postcards from hell" stuffed in the pages, and one of those inflatable pumpkins, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp"  /></p><p>It was a pretty damn spiffy night.  I learned a couple of things, and had a good time.  I brought along my little sister, and her husband to enjoy the night with me, and they had a great time too. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phantogram-high-noon-madison">Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Phantogram is an American indie band with members Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel.  According to wikipedia, they formed in 2007, but I don't think anyone really heard of them until 2009.  And 2010 is really when they got their "big break", so to speak.</p><div class='title'><b>Eyelid Movies Tour</b></div><p>I was introduced to them last year, right as they started their first national tour for the release of their upcoming debut album, <b>Eyelid Movies</b>.  I saw them on the upcoming board for High Noon Saloon, and my brother, Bill, had mentioned that they were pretty good, and that I'd probably like them.  I listened to some of their songs, and definitely liked them indeed.</p><p>On my birthday last year was when they came into Madison, and my local record store, Strictly Discs, had them put on an intimate in-store performance limited to 50 people.  I got down there the moment they opened up, and made sure to secure my place in line.  Well, it turned out that not a lot of people had heard of this.  Or they weren't interested.  I came back around 3pm when they were actually performing, and was 1 out about 30 people who listened to their short 30 minute set.</p><p>It was pretty fantastic.  They have a very melodic tone that builds a very ambient atmosphere, followed with a drum beat that guides the melodic and chorus of songs.  It's relaxing, but still energetic.  It paints a picture in my mind, every time I hear their songs.</p><p>I recorded the whole performance, last year: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4" title="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4</a></p><p>After they finished, everyone met upstairs for a quick meet-and-greet.  They brought along Vinyl copies of their yet unreleased album.  So I bought one of those, and got it signed by Josh and Sarah.  Unfortunately, I missed their performance at The High Noon later on due to birthday drinking.</p><p>Birthday Drinking wasn't a problem this year, because they came into town one day after. And the concert was on a Monday night, so I wasn't about to get shit-faced on a work night.</p><div class='title'><b>Nightlife Tour</b></div><p>It had been a while since I heard anything about Phantogram.  I saw them on High Noon's upcoming list, and had wondered if they were going to perform anything new since last year.  All of the concerts I had heard leading up to last year, were the same 11 tracks from their album.</p><p>Once again, my brother Bill sent me a link for an upcoming mini-album titled <b>Nightlife</b>.  It had 6 songs, but it still gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard them.  Some songs were rather similar to their earlier stuff.  But others actually iterated on their style, went in a few different directions, but kept their sound in tact.  I really like <b>Turning into Stone</b>, which seems to channel Moby but keeps it in their own voice.</p><p>Last night, they performed at The High Noon Saloon to a sold out crowd.  Sold out! on a Monday night, even.  Phantogram's popularity is exploding right now.  Many critics have very high praise for <b>Nightlife</b>, and even publications such as Wired are even commenting on them.  It's kind of crazy.  I doubt it would be possible to do an intimate in-store performance with them as the place would be overrun.</p><p>Along with greater popularity and a greater crowd, their stage performance has expanded.  They hired a drummer, rather than using a drum looping kit, or whatever.  Using a live drummer really makes their sound POP even more than before.  <b>They are much better live now.</b> Before it just sounded the same.</p><p>They brought along a bunch of lazers and lights too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp"  /></p><p>The crowd at the High Noon was interesting.

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, Five and I went down to Chicago to check out Amon Tobin's tour of his new album ISAM.  His tour included a crazy 3D visualization stage setup designed specifically with his album in mind, and is still currently touring across North America.  From the youtube clips I've seen of the show, it looked pretty neat.</p><p>Here is the trailer for his tour: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI</a></p><p>While the trailer represents what you see on the stage, it has a bunch of audience reactions, which leads me to believe their intended audience is the older, married, family crowd.  These are the types of trailers you'd see for the Blue Man Group, or magicians, or some stupid movie.  The type of trailer that's designed to get those boring people out of their houses and day-to-day lives, and experience something different for a change.</p><p>I'm not sure if they aired that trailer on TV, but the crowd in the Congress Theater was a bit different than the usual EDM crowd I'd expect in Chicago.  Sure, there were plenty of kids who most likely listen to dubstep and electro on the weekends.  As well as the crowd you'd find in clubs on the weekends.  But, there were also those couples who might have seen a commercial, such as the trailer, and figured they could use a night out for a change.  While the normal crowd was pushing and shoving their way around, the married crowd were respectful and nice about how packed the place was.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Opening for Amon Tobin was <b>Emika</b>, who was the official tour opener.  I really don't remember much of her set at all.  We got there about 10 minutes before she finished.  But before Amon Tobin took the stage, they sandwiched in a local opener, <b>Lorn</b>.  Lorn is one half of local electronica group <b>Omega Clash</b>, whose other half is <b>adoptahighway</b>.  I've seen adoptahighway before, and he's pretty slick.  Lorn wasn't too bad either.  He performed a somewhat downtempo, slightly experimental, yet banging set.  It was perfect for keeping the mood solid, while keeping the energy low in anticipation for Amon.</p><p>Lorn finished close to 11pm, and it took a little while for Amon to get everything setup.  I think he finally started around 11:30pm.  The curtains pulled up, and revealed the gigantic geometry stage thingy.  For the most part, it served as a canvas for the visualizations being blasted onto it from the projector right behind Five and I.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp"  /></p><p>The stage presence was huge, and reflected and reacted to the music. Amon Tobin's set was basically playing his new album ISAM from start to finish, with a little improvisation between tracks, but it didn't seem like much.  I hadn't listened to the album ahead of time, but I dunno...  It didn't really speak to me at all.  It was experimental in nature, and didn't really have any groove to it.  Without a constant beat to frame the sounds, it didn't capture my interest.</p><p>After Amon finished ISAM, he exited his contraption, got up a stage, and took a bow.  And went back inside for an encore.  After his encore, he did the same thing, and came back for a second encore.  The style of his first encore was much more drum 'n bass than experimental, and his second encore was kinda in the middle of his two styles.  I'm guessing that his started off as drum 'n bass, and eventually moved into experimental later.</p><div class='title'><b>ISAM v. Shpongletron</b></div><p>Earlier in year, Fishy, Chaos and I saw Shpongle as he rolled in Madison on tour with his own crazy stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  It has wings on the side, and an eye on the top that were made out of LEDs and had several visualizations programmed into them.  In the center sat the Shpongle head.  It would illuminate itself, and the colors would change.  The light source on the head would change as well, which was somewhat trippy to think of how it was doing that.  But then it moved!  The head twisted and contorted.  It would stick its tongue out at you.  It was really interesting to see, mainly because I wasn't expecting that at all.  And there wasn't a projector around either, so I really wasn't sure how that was happening.</p><p>Here's video I took from that show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWf</a> at the 18 minute mark.</p><p>With Amon Tobin's ISAM stage setup, that suspension of disbelief was never there.  The huge projectors in the middle of the floor shone like a spotlight on the stage, and you could clearly see the geometry of the stage setup for what it was.  Plus, there were few times when the visualizations actually took advantage of the cubed nature of the structure.  And even then, you could clearly tell it was being painted on by the projector.</p><p>It really wasn't until Amon's second encore when the visualization reached the level I had experienced with the Shpongletron.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp"  /></p><p>It painted a bunch of stacked cubes on the structure, and they twisted, and collapsed several times.  It was subtle and fit with the design, so it looked believable (at least until they fell over).  The whole rest of the show was way too deliberate.  Some of it would have been better off using a giant LED display instead.</p><p>Overall, it was alright.  Amon Tobin is part of the Ninja Tune record label.  And while I'm a big fan of that label, I think I need to remind myself that their music is very hit-or-miss with me.  Some experimental really grooves and speaks to me, but I think I need to be in a certain mood to receive it properly.  Otherwise, it falls flat :/<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/6">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/4">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (32)
