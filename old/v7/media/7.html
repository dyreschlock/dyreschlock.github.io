| January 25, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the past week, I've been to a couple music events in Madison that were pretty fun.  I love living in a town where all the great venues, bars, and other attractions are all in one small area.  A town large enough to foster, nurture, and bring in some amazing talent.  Yet, small enough that I can get anywhere in 30 minutes at most. ^_^  Especially when it's January and the weather is horrible.</p><p><b>Dustin Zahn @ High Noon</b> // Jan 15th</p><p>Last weekend, we caught word of some amazing music at the High Noon and stopped there for the evening.  The air was filled with an amazing energy of raw techno, house and a little electro.  Dustin Zahn kept the crowd moving all night long.  It was one of the best nights I've had in Madison.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v9HdtyPlDEM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v9HdtyPlDEM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"> </embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/arEZg4aH40k&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/arEZg4aH40k&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Rez!</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MHDEVO1HcYE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MHDEVO1HcYE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Dustin Zahn hails from Minneapolis, which explains a lot.  The whole night gave off the vibe of a mid-90s rave.  The kind that were prevalent in niche corners of the USA, and especially in Minneapolis.  The Minneapolis rave scene gave birth to the amazing talent and fans that surge in Minneapolis today.  Last weekend was a glimpse into that pure energy.</p><p><b>Holy F*ck @ Majestic</b> // Jan 22nd</p><p>This weekend, Madison played host to Toronto's "must-see live act" Holy Fuck.  Apparently, these guys have "redefined" what it means to give a live performance by using their raw common-sense genius to build up new songs and sounds that make every one of their shows unique.</p><p>Unfortunately...  they conducted a DJ set.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>They played some pretty awesome songs.  And after hearing what I recorded, some of the other songs sound pretty good too.  But, they came at the tail end of a horrible performance by a DJ duo known as the Fun Cartel.</p><p>The Fun Cartel are two guys with opposing musical tastes and skill.  The skinny afro guy was pretty cool.  But his sidekick would throw in tracks that completely ruined the vibe.  In addition, they failed almost each one of their transitions.  In the end, their set felt like a 3 year old's finger painting.  "Let's just throw in all of our favorite songs.  Orange mixes with Blue, right?!"  Ugh..</p><p>Also, our dinner plans for the evening didn't go so hot either.</p><p><b>Erebus @ The Annex</b> // Jan 23rd</p><p>Erebus is not in my realm of music.  They are Metal.  And while their music is definitely different than mine, metal fans could not love their music more.  Metal fans are born to rock, congregate, and mosh together.  Erebus does an amazing job of channeling that passion, energy and fandom into something that anyone with a strong passion for music can love.</p><p>Examples:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Even though there were probably 30 people or less in attendance, Erebus performed with such enthusiasm and attention that everything they did on stage was clearly meant for us.  We were the reason they were on stage.  The songs they chose, the monologues spoken.. it was all for us.  And the true fans reciprocated by doing what Metal fans do:  Hopping off the stage, slamming into each other, head bangin', and truly rockin' out.</p><p>I've seen them a couple times before, but this was truly their best night, in my opinion.  Though, I might be semi-biased.  Erebus' lead members are Dave and Gage.  Gage is one of my good friends in Madison.  We met at Widen back when we were both interns.  I first saw them perform live almost exactly 3 years ago, when they first performed live themselves (<a href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show" title="/erebus-first-show">here</a>).</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways</b></div><p>Anyways, Madison is pretty amazing.  Great music at a small scale. Daedelus is coming to town in 3 weeks! King Cannibal in 2.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Finale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-finale">Dexter Season 4 Finale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This season has been fantastic.  Normally, once Premium Channel TV shows (HBO, Showtime) start to become stale, they don't return.  Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, and other great shows start off incredibly strong.  But after Season 2 of Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood after Season 1, they completely fall to ruin.  They either forget what made them a success or can't figure out how to hold on to it.</p><p>Once I finished watching Dexter Season 3, I thought, "This is it.  Dexter is over."  Season 3 went in random directions at times, and ignored the success of Seasons 1 and 2.  Dexter didn't kill anyone for himself.  He didn't learn anything (other than the overall lesson of the season).  It had no personality, in my opinion.</p><p>Season 4 broke this stale curse.  It wasn't some dull misdirected meaningless story.  It's own self-contained story of the Trinity killer was interesting enough.  He was the first truly horrific serial killer.  Dexter saw him as a mentor, and a friend, but Trinity's demons could not be contained.  The writers weaved him into the Dexter mythos and with it brought more than just a lesson learned.</p><div class='title'><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></div><p>Now with Rita murdered as a Trinity victim, and Deb confronting Dexter about Brian Moser, I think Dexter has run out of excuses.  It annoys me how everyone just believes Dexter when he makes up these flimsy excuses, and no one thinks anything else of it.  I guess this is what happens when you kill off Doukes, the only person to actually question Dexter about what he's doing.  </p><p>Thank god Deb has started assuming this role and actually asked Dexter about his peculiar appearance at the raid on Arthur Mitchel's house.  I hope her role in Season 5 eventually leads to realization.</p><p>With Dexter only renewed through Season 5, currently, I wonder if the writers will end Dexter.  Business-wise it would be a stupid move.  The Season 4 Finale is the most watched episode of any Showtime original series with 2.6 million viewers.  But Story-wise, it would make Dexter incredibly tight.  It would never reach the point of being stale.</p><p>When Deb actually verifies the demon inside of Dexter, where would the show go from there anyways?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Paul van Dyk @ The Kennedy, Tampa" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/paul-van-dyk-the-kennedy-tampa">Paul van Dyk @ The Kennedy, Tampa</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 29, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, after seeing <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Above &amp; Beyond in Minneapolis</a>, I compared the Electronic Dance scenes in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago.  I've always wanted to see how our little corner of the DJ world compared to the major hubs.  Tampa isn't a "major" hub by any means, but Miami absolutely is.  I figured that other major cities in Florida would have quite a bit of crossover.</p><p>I've been to Tampa 4 times now, and all previous times have turned out lame.  But the opportunity finally arose this Thanksgiving as Paul Van Dyk was in town!</p><div class='title'><b>The Kennedy</b></div><p>There was some back and forth as to which Venue he was going to be at.  He was originally scheduled to be at The Kennedy but they moved him over to The Ritz in Ybor City a couple months ago.  Then 2 weeks ago, they moved him back to The Kennedy.  I'm not sure why, but the email said "our original venue has been cleared for PVD, so we're back at The Kennedy."</p><p>The Kennedy is pretty fancy.  It's setup exactly like one of those Night clubs you'd see in some TV show based in Miami (CSI, Burn Notice).  There were lush velvet couches in corned rooms lining the walls, which were roped off for VIPs only.  The edges of the walls were lined shimmering lights.  The wood throughout the place had a cherry finish with intricate designs like an old armoire.  It was a fancy cush little place.</p><p>But that what it's biggest problem.  It was little.  It was about the same size of any bar you've ever been to.  Well, maybe just a little bit bigger.  The Bar area was placed in the middle of the building and consumed almost all the space.  It started at about 40 feet from the DJ booth and continued back from there.  The dance floor was not at all wide either.</p><p>Justin and I got to The Kennedy around 10:30p.  There weren't that many people there, but it was still dense.  An opening DJ was playing songs from somewhere, but the DJ booth was vacant.  Time went by as we waited for PVD to show up, and more and more people filtered into the place.</p><p>By the time Paul Van Dyk showed up at Midnight-ish, I could hardly move.  There were nearly 2000 people in this tiny fucking place.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp"  /></p><p>I have no idea why they decided stuffing us into a fancy little lounge bar was a great idea.

That would have been so much nicer.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul Van Dyk</b></div><p>Justin and I were crammed against the edge of the dance floor.  It worked out well since I would only have people knocking into me from 2 sides rather than all sides.  We were against a railing which kept us out of the VIP area.  When Paul arrived, he actually walked right past us on the way to the bar.  He hung out there while mini-Paul setup the decks for him.</p><p>20 minutes later he took the stage and pounded our ass with sound.  Here's the beginning:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UWax8OxmmZo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UWax8OxmmZo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>He played some amazing stuff throughout the night, but a lot of familiar titles.

As evidence by the kids on Trance Addict, there are a lot of devoted fans in Florida that will journey across the state for the music.

| November 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>November continues to sound with amazing talent in the midwest and this weekend was one of the biggest.  Above &amp; Beyond came through Minneapolis and Chicago.  And Deadmau5 stopped in Chicago and Detriot.  A couple of months ago, I started listening to Deadmau5 and was quite excited to find out he'd be in Chicago soon enough.  Well, after waiting too long to form a party, Deadmau5 sold out without me...  I was disappointed, but he'll be back.</p><div class='title'><b>Above &amp; Beyond</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6015.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6015.webp"  /></p><p>Yes, Above &amp; Beyond were my plan B for Friday Night...  BUT it was the best thing that could've happened.  Above &amp; Beyond played some beautiful uplifting trance that sparked my long forgotten love of the genre.  It's absolute candy to my ears.  This ended up being one of my absolute favorite nights of the year.</p><p>They began the night with their recent remix of Dirty Vegas "Tonight"</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/loVoLv2w_ng&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/loVoLv2w_ng&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>They also played one of their new songs, "On a Good Day"</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yON4kUqqjEA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yON4kUqqjEA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Both songs titles clearly describe the loving atmosphere of the night.</p><p>...and to complement to beautiful ear candy, was wonderful eye candy too..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6041.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6063.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6077.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Electronic Dance Music</b></div><p>But, before the beauty, we were greeted with the sound of Boom Jinx, which was a perfect introduction back into Trance.  Boom Jinx played tracks nearly identical to the Trance I started off on around a decade ago.  The simple beauty of build ups and tear downs in an absolute aura of melody.  It was a warm feeling to hear that sound again.  But it certainly made me question the evening.</p><p>Over the past years, I've paid most attention to Sasha, Digweed, Moby, Ladytron, Way out West (Jody Wisternoff and Nick Warren), and the DJs of Hybridized.org.  Way out West was really my only link back to Trance, and both Jody and Nick are almost exclusively Progressive House now.  I've heard a few things from Armin and Paul Van Dyk, but never followed up.</p><p>It was odd to think that Trance hadn't evolved at all in the past 10 years, if this is what Trance today sounded like.  Of course, once Above &amp; Beyond took the stage and blew everyone away (ign dot com), I was foolish to have ever thought that.  Though, most of Above &amp; Beyond's set had a very House style to it, in a similar manor to how Paul Van Dyk sounds these days.  Once Trance, now a Housey Trance which PVD refers to simply as EDM, or <b>Electronic Dance Music</b>.</p><p>I find this odd, since the term itself implies it covers the entire genre of music, rather than just a sub-genre.  Maybe with using this blanket term, they're trying to get everyone else on earth to stop calling electronic music "Techno", and start calling it "Electronic Dance Music" or "EDM" or whatever.  It would make sense since most the <a href="http://www.djmag.com/top100" title="http://www.djmag.com/top100">Top 10 DJs in the World</a> play tracks in genres that either <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> EDM or at least orbit it.</p><p>Do people still refer to electronic music as "Techno" anyways?  The only group I can think of who might even be considered in that sub-genre are The Crystal Method.</p><div class='title'><b>Minneapolis</b></div><p>As mentioned before, this was Plan B for Friday Night.  Though, I could've saved the 4.5 hour drive to Minneapolis and gone to Above &amp; Beyond in Chicago (2.5 hour drive) on Saturday Night instead.  They were at Vision in Chicago, though, and I'm getting rather sick of that place.</p><p>The vast majority of people who go to Vision are those only interested in the night life rather than the music.  It was a bit of an eye opener going to the House of Blues are being completely surrounded with genuine fans, rather than a bunch of douche bags with popped collars, dark glasses, glamour muscles and are only there to be "seen".</p><p>Minneapolis' "scene" was born out of raves.  All of the kids back in the 90s who partied in barns and rundown community centers, run and contribute to the nightlife these days.  That genuine fandom and experience makes Minneapolis one of the best places in the nation to hear any EDM performance.</p><p>For proof of Minneapolis' fantastic electronic music community, you need only check out <a href="http://mnvibe.com/" title="http://mnvibe.com/">MN Vibe</a>, which was fostered and promoted talent for the past 8 years.  Not to mention, <a href="http://simshows.com/" title="http://simshows.com/">Sound In Motion</a> who are the ones that bring all the fantastic talent to Minneapolis.</p><div class='title'><b>Boom Jinx</b></div><p>But anyways, Boom Jinx played some pretty rad songs.  It was a lot of fun, until he started acting in that douche-baggy DJ manor.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_5990.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_5990.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_5990.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.0 Street Date Broken" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-10-street-date-broken">Evangelion 1.0 Street Date Broken</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

So, I was pretty great to finally be cured of Pink Eye by yesterday in order to attend the concert I had already purchased tickets for.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Nick Nice</b></div><p>I got there pretty early, and was able to catch Nick Nice's entire opening set.  Nick Nice has been around Madison for quite a while.  He's always opening for shows at the Majestic and the headlining 80s v. 90s nights at Majestic.  He seems to wear several different musical hats.</p><p>This was the first time I had actually heard anything he's done.  I was pleasantly surprised when he began his set with some very melodic ambient progressive tracks.  Those first two or three songs he played were amazing.  Once more and more people arrived and there filled the dance floor, he quickly transitioned out of the layers and into some god awful house music.</p><p>Ugh... Why would you do that?  You spent 20 or 30 minutes building up this wonderful sound, and then through it all away for this crap.  Not all House music is bad, but when it carries no melody, no progression, or anything interesting at all, there's absolutely no point.  It's background noise.  And then he throws in a hard electro track out of nowhere.</p><p>Overall his set made no cohesive sense at all.  He started off brilliantly, but it turned into a mish mash of song that had no business being with each other.</p><div class='title'><b>Future Rock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp"  /></p><p>Future Rock were pretty incredible though.  I actually hadn't heard of them or any of their music prior to going to this concert.  I looked them up on youtube for about 10 minutes, and then bought the tickets, but that's about it.</p><p>The band seems somewhat outdated.  The name, Future Rock, sounds like something you'd hear in the 70s or 80s.  Especially with the heavy use of Keyboards.  The band members themselves look like they're in their 40s.  I wonder if they made this band in the 80s..  Or if they made it as a retro throw-back to those ideals.</p><p>They definitely sound like they're from that era.  The keyboards scream "Future" in terms of the past, like an old Science Fiction movie or Tangerine Dream album.  It's really neat. ^_^</p><p>Here's their opening song...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YhhRpY1ENXo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YhhRpY1ENXo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I decided to leave somewhat early.  I listened to them for over an hour.  Around a midnight they finished a set, and said, "Oh Madison, we're just getting started!"  If I hadn't been sick all week, and actually had been sleeping enough, I totally would've stayed until 1am or 2am.  But, I did the responsible thing and got home to sleep enough for work the next day.  Yeah yeah...</p><p>But it was fun.  The Majestic was completely full with young college kids too.  Much like MSTRKRFT @ The Rave this past weekend, I'm glad to see the youth of today getting into electronica. ^_^  It paves the way for a bright future.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MSTRKRFT @ The Rave, Milwaukee" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mstrkrft-the-rave-milwaukee">MSTRKRFT @ The Rave, Milwaukee</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

MSTRKRFT were pretty damn amazing, and La Doche Vita were pretty awesome, too.  But, The Rave is a fucking pit.  A dank disgusting disease ridden shithole that I will genuinely need to reconsider visiting.</p><div class='title'><b>Electro and Youth</b></div><p>It was pretty great seeing a vast amount of actual electronic music fans at this event.  The past couple times that I've been to The Rave definitely had fans of the music, but it really wasn't Milwaukee's scene.  Milwaukee has greater roots in Metal and Punk, rather than a bunch of raver kids.  Minneapolis and Chicago are the real hubs around here for that kind of music.  Maybe that scene traveled from somewhere else into Milwaukee tonight for MSTRKRFT?</p><p>Though, additionally, MSTRKRFT and Electro House music generally garners a different crowd than the music that introduced me into Electronica.  The Electro House genre is pretty new and is still exploding with new talent every year.  With its arrival brings a new generation of kids into the electronic music sub-genre and sparks it with the energy of youth.  The general age of the crowd was kinda young.  Much younger than the crowd for <a href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee" title="/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method</a> a couple months ago.</p><p>That endless amount of youthful energy feeds from the powerful charge of Electro.</p><div class='title'><b>MSTRKRFT</b></div><p>These guys continue to push and develop the genre how they see fit.  MSTRKRFT are the ones basically writing the definition of Electro House.  It's amazing how most other Electro DJs follow in their footsteps, but are still one or two steps behind.  MSTRKRFT keep a distinct sound for themselves that completely sets them apart from the rest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp"  /></p><p>I was confused about when they were going to perform.  When we arrived, it looked like JFK (Jesse F. Keeler of MSTRKRFT) was already up on stage with another dude..  Once they finished, and after La Doche Vita performed, fucking DJ Funk took the stage and completely ruined the vibe.  Is DJ Funk a legitimate DJ?  or a mock DJ?  I couldn't tell if it was a joke..  Leif and I left the room and went to the other area with some locals spinnin' songs.  After a little while, we checked the main room again, and they were on stage, huzzah.</p><p>It was pretty incredible.  I'm not very current on Electro at all, but when it's on, it's on.  They played some amazing songs including one of my favorites, "D.A.N.C.E" by Justice, which I captured some on video..</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>La Doche Vita</b></div><p>Right before DJ Funk nearly ruined the evening, La Doche Vita performed a pretty great set themselves.  They mentioned they're originally from Milwaukee, but got their start down in Chicago.  They are a very young duo having only formed in 2008, but since then, have made some incredible remixes of The Faint, The Prodigy, Femme Fatality..  They have a couple of these remixes available on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita" title="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita">MySpace page</a>.</p><p>Their set consisted heavily of these types of remixes.  Leif was able to pick out Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, The Prodigy..  One of my favorite songs of the night was a remix of The Prodigy's "Smack my Bitch up" set against Deadmau5's "Ghosts 'n Stuff".  I got some video of that, too...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8XDdili0iPc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8XDdili0iPc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I'm pretty sure they were dead-set on playing that song when they noticed one of the dudes in the crowd wearing the Deadmau5 mask.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Rave</b></div><p>For the past couple of years now, living in Madison and visiting Minneapolis and Chicago regularly, it's been incredibly pleasant thanks to the Smoking Ban.  Cigarette smoke had never bothered me to the point of rioting, but it's subtle benefits are great.  My clothes aren't disgusting the next day and the air inside those bars and clubs are quite clean and occasionally refreshing.</p><p>The Smoking Ban has been yet to extend itself to Milwaukee, or at least this part of Milwaukee.  It's never been a problem for me before.  But my throat has been screwed up from food poisoning earlier this week and hadn't fully healed, yet.  Obviously yelling really loud wasn't a good idea, but with everyone smoking as if they needed it to live,  the polluted air was extra damaging.  My voice is pretty screwed up today.</p><p>Also, on the way home, I started feeling some pain in my left eye.  It was really annoying, and made me tear profusely.  It wasn't particular painful.  It just felt like something was stuck in my eye.  When I got home, my eye was a little puffy.  That's happened before..  nothing new there.  I just went to bed.  This morning my eye was inflamed.  It had fuse shut with all the gunk it excreted throughout the night.  It looked pretty gross.  A quick search of the symptoms and yep, I have pink eye.</p><p>How the hell do you get Pink Eye from going to a concert?  Especially when I hadn't touched a single thing inside the place at all.  Some website mentioned "sensitivity to light" being a cause.  Could a constant bright strobe light pointed at my face cause my eye to burst out in Pink Eye?  I've been going to clubs and concerts for years with like setups, and this has never happened.</p><p>Fucking diseased, smoke ridden venue...  Never again!<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/8">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/6">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
