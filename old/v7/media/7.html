| July 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hurrah!  Today is A Dance with Dragons day.  Almost 5 years ago, George R. R. Martin released the 4th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Feast for Crows, saying that originally it was too long!  A Feast for Crows was split into two books, and the next one should be out fairly soon.  5 years, all the fantasy nerds waited and waited and waited.  While it did take longer, the day is finally here.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp"  /></p><p>And Fuck me this book is huge.</p><p>As mentioned in my article a few days ago (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here!</a>), I finally started reading A Song of Ice and Fire as recommended to me by numerous friends,Â colleagues, and other random people.  And I've made the joke several times that each book in the series I read becomes the longest book I've ever read.  This is literally the case.</p><p>A Game of Thrones -- ~700 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Clash of Kings -- ~750 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Storm of Swords -- ~975 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Feast for Crows -- ~750 pages (hardcover)</p><p>I've only made it to A Storm of Swords at the moment.  I'm looking forward to A Feast of Crows which finally breaks the damn cycle.  But again...  Fuck me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp"  /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons -- 1040 pages (hardcover)</p><p>While these books have been described as addictive page turners, I find myself incredibly exhausted.  SO exhausted.  All the novels and books I've read before have been around the 200 or 250 park mark, with one or two hitting 300.  The last time I had a reading binge, I think I read 7 or 8 books before my motivation began to die.  Given that I'm almost 200 pages into A Storm of Swords after finishing the first two books, I think I've hit my limit :(</p><p>These books just keep going on and on and on and on.  There are two main stylistic choices that George R. R. Martin has chosen for A Song of Ice and Fire, and he is utterly stuck with these choices.</p><div class='title'><b>Character Focused Chapters</b></div><p>At first, A Song of Ice and Fire is written in third person.  Each chapter is named after a character in the story, and each chapter focuses on specific events surrounding that character.  As the story progresses, the third person take becomes more of a first person perspective written in third person.</p><p>This is good for me, as I have difficultly establishing connections to characters when everything is written in third person.  A first person story gives me information about the character's thoughts behind the action, and allows me to understand why the character is doing what they're doing.  A Song of Ice and Fire goes to great lengths to make this possible, but in the third person writing style.</p><p>A Game of Thrones is a fantastic book where things happens in one character's perspective, and then the view changes to another character and you get the other side of the story.  You get all (most) sides of the story and begin to understand that there are no villians in the story.  Each character has their motivation, and are completely consistent in what they do.  It all makes sense.</p><p>This style works well when all the characters occupy the same space.  But, it falls apart in the second and third novels when all the chapter-characters are separated, and all have their own plots.  While A Clash of Kings does have an overall plot, several characters are not participating in that plot.  Main characters are now side characters.  ...but they're still treated as main characters since they have their own chapters.  Each chapter begs for my attention, but so much of what's going on doesn't really matter.  My interest is split up into 7 or 8 concurrent storylines going on at once.</p><p>This is why I'm getting exhausted by these books.</p><div class='title'><b>Flashbacks</b></div><p>Flashbacks are good, but they aren't so good when they're used to play catch-up.  Unfortunately, while I'm reading about one character's plot, shit is still going on in the world to the other characters.  So how do we make up for this?  Start off a character's chapter with a flashback explaining what they were doing while you were reading about the other characters.</p><p>That's really what I was going for with my previous post (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here, again!</a>).  It's hard to advance the story of a character when you have to make up for all time you missed covering the other characters.  The present timeline of the chapter seems to hang there.  The story usually catches up halfway through the chapter, THEN we can doing stuff in present time.</p><p>While it IS annoying, It's pretty seemless how he integrates most flashbacks into the character's chapters.  But overall, it really seems like a side-effect to doing character focused chapters to begin with.  I think the suggestion I've heard the most from people complaing about this is that he should've just made a book all about Bran.  Then a book about Arya.  Then so on and on and on.  But TOO LATE, you're stuck with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Reading... ugh</b></div><p>Looking at my numbers above, there are 4215 pages to Song of Ice and Fire (at the moment).  And I've read about 1650 of them.  Nearly 40%!  I'll try to continue reading, especially now that my friends and colleagues have started diving into the new book.  But I don't think I can handle more than 100 pages a week.  Maybe I should start skipping certain chapters, and just read the cliff notes online...</p><p>Happy Dance with Dragons day, everyone!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I wrote about my excitement leading up to the event a few weeks ago --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">here</a>.</p><p>I wrote that after a couple of their sets were recorded from the previous weekend and starting floating around the Internet.  The Beta Nightclub set from June 16th, and their Electric Daisy Carnival set from July 18th.  Both were very similar, and had a very unique sound that proved Gabriel &amp; Dresden had returned.</p><div class='title'><b>Style</b></div><p>While technically they fall under the Trance genre, they play a lot of tracks all over the place.  One of key parts of their sound is incorporating the current sound of dance music into their sets and into their tracks.  So they'll throw in some Skrillex and Wolfgang with the vocals to their tracks and others on top of them.</p><p>Given those recorded sets from June, I figured that we would hear something similar in Chicago, and that was absolutely the case.  Like I nerd, I stood there and recorded the whole thing, and have posted it to youtube.  Even recording kinda seemed like redundant as those two other sets are much much better quality than what my camera could do.  But, at least it gives us the opportunity to get a tracklist of the entire night and maybe capture a few deviations.</p><p>Here's the youtube link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349</a></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>The tracklist was pretty easy to develop given the amount of overlap.  There are a few wholes in my list, though.  Only 8 IDs!  Not bad...</p><p>1. Justice &amp; DJ DLG vs Gabriel &amp; Dresden - Tracking Civilzation Down (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>2. Afrojack vs. Way Out West feat. Tricia Lee Kelshall - Replica Of Mindcircus (Dave Dresden Mashup)<br/>3. ID<br/>4.

Boston - More Than A Gold Dream (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>6. Deep Dish vs. Wolfgang Gartner &amp; Francis Preve - Say Hello vs. Yin (Josh Gabriel Mashup)</p><p>7. Benny Benassi feat. Gary Go - Cinema (Laidback Luke Remix w/ Skrillex Remix)<br/>8. Groove Armada - Get Down (Henrik B Mix)<br/>9. Gabriel &amp; Dresden feat. Jes pres. Motorcycle - As The Rush Comes (DJ Kue Remix)<br/>10. Mumford &amp; Sons - Little Lion Man (Sander van Doorn Remix)<br/>11.

Above &amp; Beyond feat. Zoe Johnston - No One On Earth (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix)</p><p>Leading into the weekend, Gabriel &amp; Dresden announced on Facebook that they were going to premiere a brand new song that they had just finished.  I think it's #22 on my list.</p><div class='title'><b>Duo</b></div><p>One thing that I found interesting about their performance was that they were both handling the controls during the entire night.  Both previous times I've seen G&amp;B in clubs, one of them would spin some discs, and halfway through the night, they'd switch.  Granted this was in 2004, back when they still had vinyl.</p><p>For Gabriel &amp; Dresden, I consider them to have 3 eras on distinct sound.  There's everything prior to 2004, 2004 to 2008 when they broke up, and their current sound in 2011 now that they've been reunited.  I wonder if they were spinning more as a concurrent duo towards the end in 2008, or if they were still separate as was the case in 2004.  Well, they definitely feel like a cohesive duo today. :)</p><div class='title'><b>The Mid</b></div><p>Overall, I had a great time.  Even though it was packed, it wasn't crotch-to-crotch packed, though some people seemed to think it was.  I still had room to move around, and rock out to the music.  Of course, I stayed in the exact same spot for 3 hours.  I didn't have to move through the crowds of people behind me.</p><p>The Mid has a very odd layout.  The dance floor is split up into two halves.  You have the front half in front of the stage that is completely clear and where all the dancing happens.  The back half, is completely roped off and filled with reserved tables for bottle service.  While, it seems perfect for those people who want to (or can) spend $500+ going to The Mid, and get a fantastic location in the club all to yourself, it's pretty horrible for us cheap (or budgeted) assholes who only pay for General Admission.  The reserved tables choke out the flow of human traffic from the back to the front.  The entire area surrounding that VIP is completely blocked off by bodies upon bodies of people trying to get somewhere else.  You have to shove your way through, basically.</p><p>But whatever, it's a nightclub.  If you want service or better treatment, shell out the cash.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Nook of Color" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color">A Nook of Color</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>"Excuse me, do you mind if I ask you which one that is?"</p><p>Everyday, busses enter Capitol Square in Madison, WI.  It's really the hub of all bus traffic in the city.  Whether they begin their journey there, or simply pass through is a matter of route.  Most busses arrive early, and must wait until their scheduled departure time.</p><p>Jim Hendricks waits at this bus stop every morning.  He walks from his apartment down the road, then waits for his bus to arrive.  This morning was really no different than any other.  The bus arrived on time and he boarded.</p><p>"It's a Nook Color", Jim replied.</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"A Nook Color," Jim replied again.  "From Barnes &amp; Noble."</p><p>"Ah yes...", the old man finally realized.</p><p>Today was a little different.  Someone on the bus actually talked to Jim.  Everyday, Jim waits for the bus, he boards, and now recently, he reads.</p><p>A few weeks ago premiered a television program that he was very excited for.  This program is called Game of Thrones.  It is based off of a series of novels that his college friends Tony of Gregerson and Erika of then Lamm, but now of Aho had implored him to read.  These friends were of like minds and tastes to Jim, and these books had captured their hearts.</p><p>"Game of Thrones is my favorite fantasy series.  All of his characters are rich, and his story doesn't care for them at all.  He kills of characters on a whim.  The story is brutal.  And you'd love it,"  Tony had stated.</p><p>"Yeah, Jim.  You should read them," Erika reinforced.</p><p>"I'm sure they're fantastic, but these books look really really long, and reading is boring," the young and naive Jim had replied to their recommendations.</p><p>It was 6 months and 5 years ago that Tony, in a further effort to expose Jim to these fantastic novels, had invited him to Madison.  The author, George R. R. Martin, had recently published A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in the series, and was on a book tour stretching from the salty seas of the Pacific to the Atlantic.  It was here that Jim met GRRM, shook his hand, purchased his books, and had them autographed.</p><p>But Jim was stubborn, and engulfed in course work at the time.  His stubbornness persisted even after university was completed, and began work in the midwestern city of Madison.  Many of his collegues had read the works, and shared their recommendations.  <em>Man, everyone loves these books.</em> But it was only until he saw the televised product that he began to head their words.  He and his friends watched in splendor as the distinct characters and vivid environments came to life.  After a few episodes, they were hooked.  They were fans.  And it was lucky that Jim owned the novels, so they all could read how it was originally wrote.</p><p>After 5 episodes had aired, Jim started reading Game of Thrones.  He had been discussing the program with Chris of Schroeder at his office.  <em>This show is pretty damn awesome, but there is a lot going on.  I really wonder how much of this stays true to the books.</em> So he read.  For the first time, in a long time, he read.  And of the recommendations, they were all justified.  For he did like the books.</p><p>"I really like it.  I bought it mostly for a vacation, and I've been using it quite a lot since then," he continued to reply to the old's man question on the bus.</p><p>Reading the novels had been great at first, but his yearly vacation across the seas to the volcanic Islands of Japan had drawn near.  He had a mere 200 pages remaining in Game of Thrones which he could surely finish given several hours.  <em>I'm just about done with this book, but I don't have to time before I leave.  I can't bring both books with.  They take up too much space.</em></p><p>He recalled a coversation he had with Lady Kait of Stites a week or two prior.  Though, he didn't recall the conversation perfectly as it had been at a bar, and Jim drinks many beers when he's at a bar.  He thinks this conversation was born out of talking about the band they at the bar to see.</p><p>"I find it odd how much I've completely switched to digital music.  I still feel like I'm one of those people who enjoys owning a physical copy of something.  But, ever since I bought this iPhone, I've stopped buying physical copies of music.  Almost everything is digital.  The only physical copies of music I purchase is Vinyl, as I feel that's the ultimate physical representation of music these days."</p><p>"Ya know, maybe books are the same way.  Having a first edition hardcover copy of book, is like having a vinyl copy of a vintage album.  And there are many books I don't care about but still want to read.  Maybe buying an ereader makes sense for those titles.  And portability too.  I'm going on vacation rather soon, and can't hulk around those mamoth tombs with me everywhere.  It makes sense to buy one of those things."</p><p>"Yeah, I could see that," Kait had replied, though probably just to humor him, as he was talking about boring things.  She smiled, and they went back to listening to the band.</p><p>A few days later, he found himself in Barnes &amp; Noble.  He was interested in the Nook Color above other ereaders for 3 key reasons.  The first was because of his hatred for e-ink.  e-ink was monotone and had an annoying lag between turning pages.  The second point had been it's OS built on Android.  There were several articles on tech blogs saying how easy it was to jailbreak the device, and find yourself with a full Android tablet.  Unlocked, it would be able to read any file format, read emails, looks at maps, translate Japanese.  The third point was the most important given the second point, the price.  It was only $250 for a easy-to-unlock tablet device designed as an ereader that could do much more.  After an hour of looking it over, and playing with it, he bought it.</p><p>He finished A Game of Thrones in transit to vacation.  Before returning from vacation, he was able to read over half of the second novel, The Clash of Kings.  Along with those novels, he packed several maps, an itinerary, a shopping list, and a Japanese dictionary on his Nook Color, and they were very helpful.  For this, he was grateful.</p><p>Back on the bus he relayed all of this information to the old man.  "So you can do a whole lot with it," the old man replied after a second of digesting what was just said.  Perhaps Jim had said too much information, and was probably boring people again.  They went back into silence.

| October 31, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past Thursday, I was lucky enough to grab two tickets to an early screening of 20 minutes of the upcoming <b>Tron Legacy</b> film.  Despite being billed as "Tron Night", it really was just 20 minutes of the film.  They showed 5 scenes from the first half of the movie, and finished off with an extended trailer.</p><p>I'll describe each of the scenes, but first I'll refresh everyone's memory on what happened in the first movie.  I just finished watching it a minute ago, so it's all fresh in my mind.  Then I'll get into the new movie.</p><p><b>Tron</b> </p><p>(Spoilers from Tron 1)</p><p>First off, there's <b>Kevin Flynn</b>, as played by Jeff Bridges.  He's the most notable and iconographic character in the Tron universe.  In <b>Tron</b>, Kevin Flynn is a genious video game designer working for ENCOM.  All of his work was stolen by <b>Edward Dillinger</b>, played by David Warner.  Dillinger took all the credit of Flynn's genious, and quickly rose the ranks to a top executive position.</p><p>Meanwhile, Flynn hides out in his arcade.  Many of the games produced by ENCOM line his walls.  After hours, he relentlessly hacks ENCOM's server to find definite evidence of Dilliger's misdeeds.</p><p>The fantasy world inside the computer represents programs as their human users.  Flynn's program is named CLU.  In the first couple scenes of Tron, CLU is captured by security drones and erased by <b>Master Control</b>, locking Flynn out of the ENCOM mainframe.</p><p>Master Control Program is that spinny red cylinder face guy.  MCP is an artificial intelligence set to control most of the company's assets.  When Dillinger tries to take control back from MCP, MCP backmails him into complying.</p><p>Anyways, destroying CLU also locks out <b>Alan Bradley</b>, whose program is named Tron.  Tron is a security protocol set to monitor and regulate Master Control.   There's also a girl named <b>Lora Baines</b>, who works on a laser that dematerializing objects into the mainframe.  Why?  I dunno.</p><p>So, Alan and Lora run off to Flynn's Arcade to warm him that ENCOM has found out about his hacks, and they all hatch a plan to break into the ENCOM building and hack the servers from inside.  Alan goes back to his cubical and waits for communication from Tron, while Lora escorts Flynn to her laser lab to use her computer.  Lora runs off somewhere, and Flynn starts hacking away at the mainframe to find the evidence.  Meanwhile, MCP notices that Flynn is sitting at a terminal in clear sight of the dematerializing laser, so he zaps Flynn into the Matrix.</p><p>Inside the mainframe, we're introduced to <b>Sark</b>, who is Dillinger's program.  If MCP were The Emperor, Sark who be Darth Vader.  His loyal foot soldier who does all the evil deeds without reserve.  Sark gathers up spare and discarded programs and forces them to fight each other in <b>Games</b>.</p><p>There's a little bit of religion stuffed into the plot, as MCP's method of subjugating other programs is dispelling all knowledge of Users.  Some programs believe them to exist, but it's only a legend.</p><p>Flynn is himself when he's inside the mainframe, and meets up with programs that resemble his pals in real life.  Tron resembles Alan.  Lora's program, <b>Yori</b>, resembles her.  They all journey to defeat MCP and restore peace from his tyranny.  Also, throughout the adventure, Flynn figures out he has "god-like" powers over the mainframe because he's a User.</p><p>Spoiler Alert, they defeat Sark and MCP at the end of the movie.  Flynn gets zapped back to real life, and he recovers the evidence he needs to take down Dillinger.  The last scene of the movie shows Flynn flying in on a helicopter and assuming his role as CEO of ENCOM.  HAPPY ENDING!</p><div class='title'><b>Tron Legacy Setup</b></div><p>Fast forward, 28 years later to today, and we have Tron Legacy.  Tron Night showed us 5 scenes from the finished film.  And the first one reiterated what we already know about the initial plot of the film.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 1</b></div><p>The Scene starts with <b>Samuel Flynn</b> returning to his garage home somewhere in the city.  Sam Flynn is son of Kevin Flynn, and he's 27 years old.  <b>Alan Bradley</b> enters the scene and says something like, "That was some stunt you pulled today," referring to some hijinks Sam pulled at ENCOM.  It's been 20 years since Kevin Flynn has mysteriously disappeared, and Sam is agressivly reluctant to take over ENCOM in his father's place.</p><p>Sam tells Alan to fuck off, and Alan is all like "some day you'll understand."  Before leaving, Alan mentions he received a page last night.  The last thing that Flynn said to Alan was to keep the pager at all times, and when the time comes, you'll get further instructions.  The instructions were to go to Flynn's Arcade.  Alan suggests that Sam revisit that abandoned arcade and investigate.</p><p>Next we see Sam riding to the Arcade.  He goes inside and looks around.  He finds a secret passageway behind the Tron arcade game, which leads to a secret room with computers and a dematerializing laser.  Sam starts typing away at the computer, and runs the last instruction, which zaps him into the computer.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 2</b></div><p>The preview skips ahead a little bit to the point where Sam is caught by security drones and brought to central processing with a couple other stray programs.  JUST LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE, Sam is sent to the pit and readied to be in <b>The Games</b>.  He's given his disc-thingy, and then pushed off somewhere.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 3</b></div><p>Sam finds himself in a multi-staged arena.  There's about 8 fights going on.  All are 2 player matches between programs using their discs as weapons.  Sam learns pretty quick that this is a fight to the death, when he sees a victory in another ring.  His "Oh my god what's going on" defense quickly turns into an inexperienced but calculated win as he blows away the ground underneath his opponent.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 4</b></div><p>Oh, I guess Sam has escaped with the help of a masked program.  They're driving away in an all terrain vehicle, while security drones give chase in their light cycles.  They kill a couple drones, but more continue pursuit.  They reach a cliff and go off the end of it into rough unkept terrain which light cycles cannot follow.  They've escaped!</p><p>The masked hero reveals herself to be <b>Quorra</b>, but doesn't mention her importance in the story.  The reach an outpost in the barren wasteland, and go inside.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 5</b></div><p>Quorra brings Sam into a room to reunite him with Flynn.  After they exchange a bunch of heartfelt words, Flynn says something about what's going on, but I don't remember what it was because I had no frame of reference at the time.  I don't think it was much to go on anyways.  </p><p>Also, he calls Quorra his apprentice.  And Flynn has a custom version 1.0 Light Cycle in his room that Quorra says is still the fastest vehicle on the grid.</p><div class='title'><b>Trailer</b></div><p>Right when I thought they were going to unveil more of the overall plot, it was over.  At the end of Scene 5, it goes into the Daft Punk trailer posted to youtube earlier last week.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U">Youtube!</a></p><p>The footage in the first half of the trailer we had already seen that night from the actual scenes, but they added some extended cuts of fight scenes and light cycle chases.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Going into the preview, I hadn't seen Tron in forever, and only knew that Flynn had disappeared in the Matrix and his son goes after him.  Plot-wise, I was hoping to find out more about why Flynn went back into the computer, and what was going on.  There was none of that.  I exited the theater having gained no knowledge of Tron Legacy at all, which was incredibly disappointing.  I really can't form a decent opinion about the movie if I have no idea where it's going.</p><p>But it's definitely pretty.  Really damn pretty.  The preview was in 3D, and I really liked how it wasn't 3D at all in real life, but was completely 3D inside the computer.  It made for a fun transition.</p><p>If you've seen any trailer, or even watch the youtube I posted above, the look of Tron Legacy is gorgeous.  I love the art direction.  All the environments have this luminescent tint outlining their structure against a black surface.  Everything is crisp and clean, like everything is made of glass.  And the 3D effects ephasize the glassy translucent look of everything.  It's marvelous.</p><p>That's really why I'm into this movie.  The first moment I saw how everything looked, I was hooked.  And that's really what Tron has been about since the beginning.  The highest praise Tron ever got was that it was really damn pretty.  "A Technological Achievement."  </p><div class='title'><b>As a movie, it was Okay, but it didn't suck.  That's really the kicker.  Tron Legacy just needs an Okay story underneath to keep itself from ruining the marvelous visuals.</b></div><p>It might need something else though...</p><div class='title'><b>Tron's Legacy</b></div><p>Tron is not an easy movie to find.  Netflix does not have it on Instant Streaming, AND it no longer offers the discs.  If you turn to Half.com and Ebay, you'll only find copies of the DVD going for much more than you'd spend on a DVD these days.  They haven't released it on Bluray, but I expect the probably will when Tron Legacy does.</p><p>I watched it by downloading a torrent, but it ended up having an Italian dub over the dialogue.  Thank God the story isn't that complicated.  I knew what was going on thanks to Wikipedia's synposis.</p><p><b>I think having detailed knowledge of what was going on in the first movie is pretty important to understanding everything in Tron Legacy.</b>  Otherwise, the visuals won't be enough to dazzle you, and the movie will fall flat.</p><p>If you haven't seen Tron since you were a kid, name 3 or 5 things you remember from the film.  These things would probably include Jeff Bridges, Light Cycles, Disc Throwing, the Big Red Spinning Head Thing, and the whole landscape inside of the computer.</p><p>You probably don't remember the part about CLU dying at the beginning.  Or why or how Flynn even got into the computer.  Or that Flynn never uses his Disc once, in fact I think he drops it halfway through the film.  Or that Tron is a security program.  Or who Alan Bradley is.</p><p>Anyways, Good Luck finding a copy of Tron to watch.  You can't even go to Blockbuster now.  Maybe Family Video might have a copy?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-awakening">The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Spring Awakening 2010 was the last one night event, they did before skipping 2011, and having the 2-day festival in 2012.  More on that one here: <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">July 21st, 2012</a>.</p><p>The Headlining lineup for 2010 was <b>Above & Beyond</b>, <b>Benny Benassi</b>, and <b>Second Sun</b> (Live).</p><p>Five and I went there together.  We arrived as opener <b>DJ BeBe</b> was finishing his set.  <b>Erik K</b> took over the opening duties soon after.  Both were fantastic openers. :)</p><p><b>Second Sun</b> were next, and they performed a great live set of their songs.  <b>Benny Benassi</b> was next.  I had not heard his music prior to the night.  He played some rather interesting tracks that really set his set apart from anything I had heard before.  Crazy drops and breaks in the atmosphere.</p><p>But, after seeing them in 2009, I was super excited to see <b>Above & Beyond</b>, and also introduce them to Five. :)  I felt like their 2009 performance at Epic was much more "magical".  At Epic, they felt much more connected to the crowd.  The Congress was just way too big to make that connection.  But they still were fantastic.  Here are thoughts on that event: <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">November 23rd, 2009</a>.</p><p><br/>Here are videos I took of the whole evening: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/paul-oakenfold-epic-minneapois">Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This night was a really great throwback.  Before Paul Oakenfold took the stage, Jack Trash addressed the crowd and talked about The Quest.  </p><p>"Do any of you remember the last time Paul Oakenfold was here?  It was in 2004, back when this place was The Quest.  It was dank, and dirty."</p><p>Aww, The Quest wasn't that bad. :/  But, I definitely remember.  I was there. :)  And I have some photos from that event:  <a href="/old/v7/perfecto-quest-minneapolis" title="/perfecto-quest-minneapolis">July 18th, 2004</a></p><p><br/>Oakenfold's performance wasn't too bad.  I think he had recently started embracing his past and coupling it with his future.

| January 25, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the past week, I've been to a couple music events in Madison that were pretty fun.  I love living in a town where all the great venues, bars, and other attractions are all in one small area.  A town large enough to foster, nurture, and bring in some amazing talent.  Yet, small enough that I can get anywhere in 30 minutes at most. ^_^  Especially when it's January and the weather is horrible.</p><p><b>Dustin Zahn @ High Noon</b> // Jan 15th</p><p>Last weekend, we caught word of some amazing music at the High Noon and stopped there for the evening.  The air was filled with an amazing energy of raw techno, house and a little electro.  Dustin Zahn kept the crowd moving all night long.  It was one of the best nights I've had in Madison.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9HdtyPlDEM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arEZg4aH40k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Rez!</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHDEVO1HcYE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Dustin Zahn hails from Minneapolis, which explains a lot.  The whole night gave off the vibe of a mid-90s rave.  The kind that were prevalent in niche corners of the USA, and especially in Minneapolis.  The Minneapolis rave scene gave birth to the amazing talent and fans that surge in Minneapolis today.  Last weekend was a glimpse into that pure energy.</p><p><b>Holy F*ck @ Majestic</b> // Jan 22nd</p><p>This weekend, Madison played host to Toronto's "must-see live act" Holy Fuck.  Apparently, these guys have "redefined" what it means to give a live performance by using their raw common-sense genius to build up new songs and sounds that make every one of their shows unique.</p><p>Unfortunately...  they conducted a DJ set.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzMuLePLx58" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/84PVEYey4H8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>They played some pretty awesome songs.  And after hearing what I recorded, some of the other songs sound pretty good too.  But, they came at the tail end of a horrible performance by a DJ duo known as the Fun Cartel.</p><p>The Fun Cartel are two guys with opposing musical tastes and skill.  The skinny afro guy was pretty cool.  But his sidekick would throw in tracks that completely ruined the vibe.  In addition, they failed almost each one of their transitions.  In the end, their set felt like a 3 year old's finger painting.  "Let's just throw in all of our favorite songs.  Orange mixes with Blue, right?!"  Ugh..</p><p>Also, our dinner plans for the evening didn't go so hot either.</p><p><b>Erebus @ The Annex</b> // Jan 23rd</p><p>Erebus is not in my realm of music.  They are Metal.  And while their music is definitely different than mine, metal fans could not love their music more.  Metal fans are born to rock, congregate, and mosh together.  Erebus does an amazing job of channeling that passion, energy and fandom into something that anyone with a strong passion for music can love.</p><p>Examples:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJTsfkXqEDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jMknhpY2hHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Even though there were probably 30 people or less in attendance, Erebus performed with such enthusiasm and attention that everything they did on stage was clearly meant for us.  We were the reason they were on stage.  The songs they chose, the monologues spoken.. it was all for us.  And the true fans reciprocated by doing what Metal fans do:  Hopping off the stage, slamming into each other, head bangin', and truly rockin' out.</p><p>I've seen them a couple times before, but this was truly their best night, in my opinion.  Though, I might be semi-biased.  Erebus' lead members are Dave and Gage.  Gage is one of my good friends in Madison.  We met at Widen back when we were both interns.  I first saw them perform live almost exactly 3 years ago, when they first performed live themselves (<a href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show" title="/erebus-first-show">here</a>).</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways</b></div><p>Anyways, Madison is pretty amazing.  Great music at a small scale. Daedelus is coming to town in 3 weeks! King Cannibal in 2.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Finale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-finale">Dexter Season 4 Finale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| December 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This season has been fantastic.  Normally, once Premium Channel TV shows (HBO, Showtime) start to become stale, they don't return.  Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, and other great shows start off incredibly strong.  But after Season 2 of Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood after Season 1, they completely fall to ruin.  They either forget what made them a success or can't figure out how to hold on to it.</p><p>Once I finished watching Dexter Season 3, I thought, "This is it.  Dexter is over."  Season 3 went in random directions at times, and ignored the success of Seasons 1 and 2.  Dexter didn't kill anyone for himself.  He didn't learn anything (other than the overall lesson of the season).  It had no personality, in my opinion.</p><p>Season 4 broke this stale curse.  It wasn't some dull misdirected meaningless story.  It's own self-contained story of the Trinity killer was interesting enough.  He was the first truly horrific serial killer.  Dexter saw him as a mentor, and a friend, but Trinity's demons could not be contained.  The writers weaved him into the Dexter mythos and with it brought more than just a lesson learned.</p><div class='title'><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></div><p>Now with Rita murdered as a Trinity victim, and Deb confronting Dexter about Brian Moser, I think Dexter has run out of excuses.  It annoys me how everyone just believes Dexter when he makes up these flimsy excuses, and no one thinks anything else of it.  I guess this is what happens when you kill off Doukes, the only person to actually question Dexter about what he's doing.  </p><p>Thank god Deb has started assuming this role and actually asked Dexter about his peculiar appearance at the raid on Arthur Mitchel's house.  I hope her role in Season 5 eventually leads to realization.</p><p>With Dexter only renewed through Season 5, currently, I wonder if the writers will end Dexter.  Business-wise it would be a stupid move.  The Season 4 Finale is the most watched episode of any Showtime original series with 2.6 million viewers.  But Story-wise, it would make Dexter incredibly tight.  It would never reach the point of being stale.</p><p>When Deb actually verifies the demon inside of Dexter, where would the show go from there anyways?<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/8">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/6">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (39)
