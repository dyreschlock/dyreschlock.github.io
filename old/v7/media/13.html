| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Headed back from the conference on Monday Night, I sat next to a fellow on the bus that was an avid Heroes fan. In fact, I had completely forgot that Heroes was on that night being immersed in all things Adobe. After we shared opinions on the show, he asked how I liked the show that trailed afterward, <b>Journeyman</b>.</p><p>I had completely written off this show. I wasn't interested at all, but what did peek my interest when he described it as "Quantum Leap done right".. Now that's a bold statement. Quantum Leap is one of those classic Sci Fi shows that everyone can enjoy, so adding a derogatory statement to push your show... well, that's something a fan would take issue with.</p><p>Anyways, since it trails Heroes and this guy seemed to think it was pretty bad ass, I thought I'd give it a chance. So, as I caught up with Heroes today, I decided to catch myself up with Journeyman as well.</p><div class='title'><b>What is it?</b></div><p>Journeyman follows Dan Vassar, a San Franciscan journalistic with a decent life, a great wife Katie, a son Nate. He also has a brother, Jack Vassar, who's a police detective. Part of Dan's past is revealed right away.. apparently his ex-fiance, Livia, had died in a plane crash 9 years ago.</p><p>Dan finds himself flipping back and forth through time without reason. One day, he's taking a cab ride and suddenly finds himself back in time 20 years. He flips back and forth a couple times with a common thread between each jump.. a man named Neil Stratos (or something like that). One a jump is complete, he's brought back to his current time a day or two after his disappearance.</p><p>These jumps are not explained what-so-ever. One second he's walking along the street and Dan's head begins to pound. The headache triggers something that shoots him back in time and there you have it.</p><p>So far each episode has centered on a single person that Dan did not know prior and that he must help for the good of humanity. Sounds like the exact plot of Quantum Leap, eh?</p><p>Throughout these time jumps, he runs into little pieces of his past. He accidentally meets the past version of this ex-fiance a couple times, but then he runs into the present version of Livia. It seems that Livia is also a time-traveler.. she doesn't know what's going on either, but she has some tips for Dan. She is kinda Scott Bakula's Dean Stockwell for the moment.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Quantum Leap</b></div><p>It certainly has the concept of Quantum Leap down, but much has changed. This time-traveling craziness really screws up his marriage, his job. This isn't Science trying to fix the past for the good of humanity, this is a typical normal guy that finds himself mixed up in this time travel business. He has just as many questions as the viewer does.</p><p>It has a very dramatized modern feel to it compared to the kooky Sci Fi bender of the early 90s. But the rules are a bit different. As stated above, he's accidentally flying through time, so he has to pick up a couple time-traveling survival tips.. like using a cellular phone from the mid-90s, not using our current US currency (like those new $20 bills), and so forth.</p><p>Also, unlike Quantum Leap, Dan does not switch places with a patron of the past. He disappears from one time and appears in the other. Compensation of matter is not even discussed in the show, but it's only been two episodes. The big mystery at the moment is both why is and how does Dan travel through time.</p><div class='title'><b>Faulty</b></div><p>This show would be fine except it's not really that great. Journeyman is a drama, before it's a sci fi show. I'm sure that follows from its creator Kevin Falls, known for the West Wing. Since it's a drama, it takes itself very seriously and provides very subtle humor, rather than more blatant stuff like in Heroes.</p><p>Journeyman doesn't compensate for this at all.. The writers try to make things interesting by making his wife, his brother, and his boss all pissed off at him for disappearing. Well sure, I'd be pissed off if my husband disappeared for 2 days without warning, but it doesn't make for good TV.</p><p>Dan really isn't all that funny either. You'd think the stuff would try to take the light-side of accidental time travel and what not, but NO.. Dan is a very stern stoic fellow that will do what needs to be done. Not that interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Worth watching?</b></div><p>I dunno.. After watching the first two episodes, I thought the show was somewhat interesting, but if they want to stay on the air, they will need to move the plotline of the show very quickly or else people will just stop watching. Overall, I'm not itching to see episode 3, but I will. I'll continue to invest my time in the show, but I don't see it paying off.</p><p>Who knows though.. surprises are good ^_^ Maybe he'll go back in time to stop his show from being canceled.</p><p>This is not Quantum Leap done right, Quantum Leap is Quantum Leap done right.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tear Jerkers" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tear-jerkers">Tear Jerkers</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Everyone once in a while, you'll come across a movie..  A movie that can be engaging, can be captivating, and overall you emotionally invest yourself in from the start.  Whether, you love the characters, love the environment, love the music or any other part of it, you are brought into the world with such force that you tune out everything else.  This movie (or game) becomes part of you.</p><p>With such beauty it brings itself to the absolute climax and you are there riding along side it..  You are there with the characters, with the scene as it unfolds.  and BAM.. it hits you.  That feeling of absolute beauty.  So much beauty fills you.. overflows through you..  so much so, that can't help but shed a tear.</p><p>Pure Happiness ^_^</p><p>That's how I feel every time I watch <b>Princess Mononoke</b>.  That's how I feel when Ashitaka and San return the head to the Dear God, he revives himself, and then falls to his death..  At that split moment, when all the destruction, all the hate, and all the war is whisked away into the air..  The peaceful, raped, and bare land lays still..  until the buds of life begin to grow.  The brown scorched hills begin to breathe green from its soil, as the piano solo starts..</p><p>:sniff:..  it's so beautiful..</p><p>It's hard to hold back your emotions when you realize that life does move on..  With all the sadness, anger, and horror, life will always prevail.</p><p>Oddly enough, wasn't it a decade ago when it first came out in theaters?  :looks it up: .. nope, I'm wrong.  It came out in October 1999 in US theaters.  Heh, that was a good movie date..  I went with both Michelle and Lindsey (co-workers at Toys R Us) to Plymouth Manns theater the day it came out.  However, it did release in Japanese theaters in July of 1997.</p><p>Hopefully, whomever holds the North American rights will release a Blu-ray version of Mononoke in the near future.</p><p>Anyways, aside from <b>Princess Mononoke</b>, there is one other movie that captivates me with so much emotion..  and that is <b>Garden State</b>.  I should really buy myself a copy of that movie.  That's the one with Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  I think there may have been others, but i cannot recall.</p><p>Excellent movies..<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Recent Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/recent-movies">Recent Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This summer has been pretty kickass for movies.  In fact, I don't think there's been a summer where I've gone out and seen so many movies.  Transformers, The Simpsons, Superpad, Bourne Ultimatum, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Spiderman 3, Live Free or Die Hard..  All of them entertaining, and some pretty good.</p><p>There are two other movies I've seen this summer which are also pretty good, but not as widely talked about as these big Blockbusters..</p><p><b>The Invasion</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>This past weekend, when I was back home in Minneapolis my little brother and I caught The Invasion, starring Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  The Invasion is about an alien invasion on earth based off of the novel Body Snatchers, and somewhat of a remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Nicole Kidman is a now divorced single mom who is loosely dating Daniel Craig, when the invasion begins.  They try to survive, all while solving the key to defeating the aliens.</p><p>The Invasion is the most passive alien invasion I have ever witnessed in film.  These aliens are micro-organisms which infect humans by mutating nerve cells.  Once the individual falls asleep, the organisms take advantage of our involuntary glandular sweating to transform us from who we were, into their completely controlled slaves.  We're still who we are.. we're just controlled by them.</p><p>The first hour of the movie is their subtle take-over of humanity.  Once the main characters figure out what's going on, it's too late and it becomes a race for survival.  Nicole Kidman's son is immune to their advances and Nicole Kidman must retrieve him and bring him to the resistance to develop a cure.  But, she's been infected and must keep herself from falling asleep and turning into a slave.</p><p>The Invasion is very intense.  It's a lot like a zombie movie..  the fear of being discovered while hiding from the zombies.  the intense action of running away from zombies.  The Invasion ends strong, but begins very weak.  It's not the best movie in the world, but for some reason..  it really sticks with me.  Probably because i really like Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  Plus, some the zombie/aliens are quite creepy and spooky.. like that little Asian kid.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion:</em></b> Anywho, catch it out, if you're so inclined.  It's not half bad..</p><p><b>Stardust</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>Stardust is a fantasy fairy-tale written by Neil Gaiman.  I saw this about a week ago down in Rockford with Erika and Stephen.</p><p>Stardust's main hero is a boy named Tristan and his story of becoming a man.  He lives in a little english town called Wall, which is bordered by a wall that humans must never pass through.  Beyond the wall lies the fairy-tale kingdom of Stormhold, where, this very day, the King lie on his death bed.  Stormhold has a tradition that only a solitary living heir may ascend the throne..  which is a problem since 4 sons still live.  As the king, played by Peter O'Toole, draws his finally breath..  the one to ascend the throne will turn his now diamond pendent back into a Ruby.</p><p>Ok, I'm going to stop right here and not give away the entire movie.  Suffice to say, a star falls to earth which Tristan wishes to capture for his "true love".  But the witch wished to possess this star for immortality.  The ruby knocked the star out of the sky, so the Star has the Pendant on her.  Everyone is after the Star, which Tristan finds first.</p><p>This movie is quite a gem.  It features several all-star actors, Peter O'Toole, Michele Pfeiffer, Claire Daines, Robert De Niro, and Ian McKellen..</p><p>Stardust reminds me a lot of Princess Bride.  It's completely ridiculous and never takes itself seriously, but still retains a serious plot and presents a wonderful tale of love and adventure.  There were times I smacked myself on the head because it was so dumb, but also warmed my heart at the cutesy scenes.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think it'll reach the cult star power that Princess Bride has these days, but it might if the proper crowd gets a hold of it.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion: </em></b> Definitely check it out. ^_^  Great date movie.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 21, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Dexter is a television program on Showtime.  Dexter, played by Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under fame, is a serial killer.  His victims happen to be other serial killer and murderers.  This is the way he balances out his serial killer need for bloodshed while performing acts of good.  A vigilante at night, but a forensics officer during the day, solving crimes and misdeeds of bloodshed and foreplay.  One job helps facilitate the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 1</b></div><p>However, Dexter's word is turned upside down with the emergence of a true rival.  A serial killer with true value of cleanliness, precision, and love towards his killing methods.  This killer leaves hints for Dexter.  Plays with Dexter.  Looks for a friend in Dexter.  and Dexter finds a playmate in him.</p><p>Dexter is a wonderfully crafted, suspenseful show that will leave you wanting more and more.  I was first recommended to watch this show when I returned from Japan and visited Platteville for the first time.  Matt, Dave, Jamie and Tony were all in agreement that I needed to see this..  but I was busy dealing with the depression of being back in the states.  Luckily, when I visited Justin in North Carolina he was of the same opinion, sat me down with Showtime on Demand, and let me be.</p><p>Season 1 just came out today on DVD, and I definitely recommend this show to those who haven't seen it.  Unlike those arrogantly priced HBO series, Showtime has priced Dexter Season 1 at $40 MSRP..  but you can pick it up all 12 episodes of season 1 for $30 at Best Buy this week.</p><div class='title'><b>Showtime v. HBO</b></div><p>Showtime is really pushing the public towards this show, it seems.  Now that HBO is basically dead, and half a million subscribers canceled their service because Sopranos is now done, Showtime sees this as its chance to pull in as many of that audience as possible.  Dexter is a strong strong show.</p><p>Hell, we almost switched over to Showtime from HBO because of the Sopranos and Dexter, but ended up just quitting HBO.  Sorry, but John from Cincinnati is ass.</p><p>These real high profile pay-channel TV programs really start off strong, for the most part.  Sopranos Season 1 and 2 were amazing, but then began to wither in Season 3.  Six Feet Under Seasons 1 and 2 were equally amazing, but again.. lost all steam in Season 3.  Deadwood didn't keep it's amazing quality past Season 1.  Season 2 killed it.  And Now John from Cincinnati can't even start up strong.</p><p>Season 1 of Dexter was quit well done, despite a couple stereotypical drama-like plot devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 2</b></div><p>Episodes 1 and 2 of Dexter Season 2 have been "leaked" on the Internet.  I just finished watching them and this show really raised the bar.  I can't wait for episode 3...  which'll be in the second week of October :/</p><p>I use the term "leaked" loosely because if I were Showtime, I would send out the first episode or two to generate even more buzz on the show.  I mean, I want to see Season 2 now more than ever thanks to that 2 hour teaser.  It makes decent sense.</p><p>The first two episodes work very well with each other and tie up most of the stuff brought up in this episodes.</p><div class='title'><b>Anywho..</b></div><p>Definitely great stuff..  But, Rent or Netflix Dexter Season 1 today.  ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Fall Season" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-fall-season">The Fall Season</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>The summer is a great time of the year.  It's nice outside and the general media actual promotes the activity of going outside by not airing anything good on TV (except for the Sopranos finale).  I've had a great time, actually..  Disc golfing, relaxing, spelunking.  But as the summer begins its downward spiral post-climax, it's also great to look forward to TV again.  and why not?  TV is actually starting to get good again, in general.  When does everything begin?  Let's see here...</p><p>Monday, <b>September 24th</b> - NBC - <b>Heroes</b> Season 2 Premiere<br/>Thursday, <b>September 27th</b> - NBC - <b>The Office</b> Season 4 Premiere<br/>Sunday, <b>September 30th</b> - SHO - <b>Dexter</b> Season 2 Permiere<br/>Thursday, <b>October 4th</b> - NBC - <b>30 Rock</b> Season 2 Premiere</p><p>All four of these shows have their previous season DVD box set releasing in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>August 21st - Dexter Season 1<br/>August 28th - Heroes Season 1<br/>September 4th - The Office Season 3<br/>September 4th - 30 Rock Season 1</p><p>The Dexter box-set is crazy cheap on Amazon, so i pre-ordered that one, but I think i'll pass on the other box sets. Unfortunately, both <b>LOST</b> and <b>Sarah Connor Chronicles</b> begin airing in Feb 2008, so the waits continues :/</p><p>__</p><p>In other completely un-related news, I cut my hair a little bit on Thursday.  I sliced off a whole 3 or 4 inches on my general length.  I must say, it feels quite nice.  You'd think shortening my hair a mere 8 or 10% wouldn't make much of a difference, but it feels more manageable.  That's probably more a result of having even ends, though.</p><p>It feels good.  I should have trimmed my hair a while ago.  The last time sheers had touched my auburn locks was well over 4 years ago..  maybe closer to 5, actually.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost End" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-end">Lost End</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 24, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>I love this show.</p><p>Well, my predictions in yesterday's post were quite a ways off, and my expectations were exceeded in ways I didn't even think of.  It feels rather weird though..  this whole Season kinda felt like not much has happened (up until the last 4 episodes), but the show has come a long way since last year.  We know many of the Others, have seen all the Dharma stations, and know what happened to the Dharma Initiative.  We also know who's been getting busy with each other on the Island, and Locke has become a badass again.</p><p>And what the hell is up with Mikhail..  he gets the shit kicked out of him every single episode he's on, and has even died twice, but still comes out okay the next episode.  I think the writers took a page out of South Park for this guy.  Maybe the name Mikhail is the Russian equivalent of Kenny.</p><p>Anywho, Now that all of my TV shows have completed until Fall, it's time to go outside and frolic in the bask of Summer.  Or (something i'll probably do) watch all the episodes of Lost again from the very beginning by showing them to new people.</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>As stated yesterday, only 3 seasons remain with 16 episodes each.  The next episode of Lost will air in February of 2008, though.  The tiny 4 month Season 4 should end around this time next year.  So the timeline of episodes is probably something like this:</p><p>Season 4: Feb 2008 - May 2008<br/>Season 5: Feb 2009 - May 2009<br/>Season 6: Feb 2010 - May 2010</p><p>Also: I will buy <a href="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost" title="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost" title="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost">these</a> once they have all eight stations included.

| May 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Last night, was the ending of Heroes Vol. 1 and I'm not really sure how i feel about the ending.</p><p>One can't simply watch Heroes and not compare it to Lost, being it the other prime time networked Sci-Fi show.  Lost does a lot of things that really keep me watching, but others constantly complain about.  Lost is all about compounding mystery and never really giving the audience any specific closure.  The writers allow the audience to build up theories and speculate about the show's direction, so the mystery will always be there.  Specifically with the way they end a Season.  Each season constantly builds up to a massive climax where the audience isn't given enough information to solve a mystery, but ends in such a way where the first 4 or 5 episodes of the next season undoubtedly will.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b><br/>For example, at the end of Season 1, no mystery was really solved, but there was closure on the current events.  Sayid and Charlie dispelled the Other's incoming attack, while Jack, Locke, Kate, and Hurley blew open the Hatch and while Sawyer, Jin and Michael were blown into the Ocean.  The biggest mystery of Season 1 became the main focus of Season 2: The Hatch.  The first 3 or 4 episodes finally gave the audience what they wanted throughout Season 1 and the rest of the Season compounded the mystery.</em></p><p><em>The same happened with the end of Season 2.  Well, i suppose one very large mystery was solved at that time: "What would happen if the counter went past 0?"  Also, we learned why/how the plane crashed on the Island.  Season 2 was kinda at odds with itself, since it juggled two mysteries at once.  The ending of season 2 gave closure to Hatch, while climaxing on the Others.  I suppose another mystery solved was the identity of Henry Gale.</em></p><p><em>Anyways, the point is that the Season 2 ender setup Season 3 to give the audience what the wanted with the Others.  Even though, they spread out the answers across the entire Season.</em></p><p><em>The same will true with tomorrow night's Season 3 finale.  All current events will be resolved, and a 'larger' mystery will show itself to be the focus of Season 4.  What could it be?  I think Jacob or something involving Jacob will be the focus of Season 4, while half-way through the Season, 'The Rescue' will start showing its face and probably be the focus of Season 5, with Season 6 something to do with Dharma.</em></p><p><em>If I were to name the seasons, I would name season 1: the crash, season 2: the hatch, and season 3: the others.  perhaps season 4 will be 'the island', season 5: the rescue, and so on.</em></p><p>Anyways, the reason I bring up Lost is that the Season ender gives the audience something to look forward to.  It ends on a cliffhanger that makes the audience squirm.  Heroes did not do that last night, in my opinion.  The whole season led up to Peter and Sylar fighting and the writers gave them exactly that.  The battle to save the world and enough of the aftermath to bring the audience back down from their high.  Volume 1 is closed.</p><p>The only cliffhanger the audience was given was the first 5 minutes of Volume 2, with Hiro back in time when the eclipse happened.  That's not what i care about at the moment.  I cared about Sylar fighting Peter, and stopping the bomb..  but all that is done with now.  I can't get attached to a story element in Season 2 when i've only been given 5 minutes of it.</p><p>The ending also eluded to Sylar being alive, and I'm sure Peter is still alive as well.  If Season 2 focuses on this, it'll just be Season 1 all over again.</p><p>So, yes..  I don't really know how i feel about it, because on one hand: i was given exactly what i wanted, but on the other: now what do i look forward to.  Lost gets it in this department..  even though, so many people complain about it.</p><p>So that's how i feel about that.  I can't wait for the finale of Lost tomorrow. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>Lost will be a total of 6 Seasons with the remaining 3 seasons only 16 episodes each, as opposed to 24 episodes.  Each episode will air consecutively.</p><p>Heroes will be back with 24 episodes, and a companion 6 episode series entitled Origins.  Each episode of Origins will focus on a single New character that might be brought into the main show.</p><p>In an interview with the creator of Heroes, he states that he wanted to make the cast of each Season as independent from each other as possible.  Originally, he was planning on killing off almost all of the current cast, with only 2 or 3 continuing characters into Season 2.  Season 2 would feature an almost entirely new cast.  He changed his mind after the audience really responded to the current set of characters.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, it makes sense to give that much closure to Season 1.  Then you can begin anew.</p><p>(sorry.. i don't have sources, at the moment, for these 3 tidbits)<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost - Purgatory" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-purgatory">Lost - Purgatory</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p><em>Lost Spoilers ahead</em></p><p>Last night's episode of Lost put a solid structure on one of those internet theories about the Island.  This theory states pretty much exactly what has been said in the last two episodes that "all the 'survivors' of 815 actually died in the crash and the island is Purgatory."  Naomi confirms this by saying that in the real world they found Oceanic flight 815 at the bottom of the ocean, in tact, with all passengers in tact and very dead.  Locke's father also says the same thing.</p><p>Lets examine everyone else's back story of how they got to the island.  Naomi's helicopter just crashed in the sea, Desmond was thrown overboard in a violent storm, Juliet drank some unknown substance given to her, Locke's father was smashed into a median, Danielle's research ship crashed on the island.  Perhaps they did all die, and this is the gateway to the afterlife.  Perhaps their actions on this island will determine where they spend enternity.  The island follows a similar construct to life, but with a few changes.  If you die on the island, do you go to hell or heaven?  Is the island itself Heaven, considering the others are a group of "good" people.  Since Ben is their leader, does that make him God, or Jesus?  Or is the Island hell, as Locke's father puts it, which would make Ben Satan or some devil?</p><p>I guess this explains why the others kidnap certain people.  They are separate the bad ones from the good ones..  The heaven candidates from the hell candidates.</p><p>Does this make the big bad black cloud of smoke the Reaper? Does that make the sonic fence the divide between heaven and hell?<br/>The whole thing with the babies also promotes this theory.  Life cannot be conceived on the Island, because everyone is already dead.  I guess the writers believe that Life begin at conception.  This is why Claire's baby is fine, and why all the other mothers die before the baby is born.</p><p>However, this whole "island = purgatory/afterlife" debate has a couple holes in it.  What about Michael?  If this is the afterlife, where did Ben send Michael?  To be reborn?  To heaven?  Or to wake up from purgatory back in the real world?  What about Ethan?  If he can leave the island to the real world and recruit people like Juliet, what does that make him?  An angel?</p><p>How do the numbers play into this theory?</p><p>The end of the season should be interesting.. even though this concept is very Twilight Zone-esq.  The really hasn't been a lot of build up, but it seems like the other's incoming attack on the survivor's camp with be the climax.  Along with whatever Jack knows.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sakuracon-seattle-wa">SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>This weekend, Kyle, Jesse and Myself flew out to Seattle, WA to attend <a href="http://www.sakuracon.org/" title="http://www.sakuracon.org/" title="http://www.sakuracon.org/">Sakura-Con</a>, Seattle's premiere Anime Convention.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>One of the two days i've attending SPAMM this semester, Kyle queries, "say Dyre, Jesse and I were wondering if you'd be interested in flying out to Seattle for Sakura-Con this coming April."  I thought about it for a second, but that was all the time i needed before agreeing to their proposal.  "Hmmm...  that sounds like a great idea, there Kyle.  I'll definitely take a look into costs, planning and the like."</p><p>Going out to Seattle offered more than just an Anime convention.  SPAMM founders Ace and Jess had moved out there when Ace got a job working for Microsoft.  Also, another friend of ours, Hilary, lived in the 5 hour vicinity, too.  Plus, it's fricken Seattle.  I've wanted to go there ever since i graduated High School.  I'm not really sure how that came about..</p><p>Anywho, i got price quotes, hotel reservations, etc all set up.  Did a cost benefit analysis for our options, and everything seemed quite kosher.  Off we went.</p><div class='title'><b>Seattle, WA</b></div><p>I hardly did any research about what we were going to do in our downtime, but the little research i did just blew me away.  I had never actually looked at a map of Seattle, so i hit up google maps and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr"> typed it</a> in.</p><p>My god.  Even from the plain maps, it looked beautiful.  Vast amounts of lakes and rivers, covered the terrain.  This was all realized as our plane headed downward into the area:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" /></p><p>Cool Blue Lakes and Rivers, Lush Green Forests, White Tips of distant mountains..  and the Sky-scrapper center.  Seattle is all these things in one.</p><p>Once we landed, got our luggage, and rented a car, we set forth on the open roads.  The terrain was as green as it looked from the sky.  Despite the heavy amount of urbanization, Seattle maintained it's green roadside forests, and beautiful scenery, though the large shipyards took away from the natural scenery.  We drove up Hwy 5 towards downtown, but then took a detour East headed for Redmond.  The suburban areas kept itself grounded to the environment with heavy forests, mixed with houses, restaurants and other businesses.  We attempted to look for Microsoft Headquarters and Nintendo Headquarters, but were unable to trainspot them from the highway, nor the little suburban roundabout before heading back the direction we came.</p><p>Our cheap ass rental car felt like it was about to die, so we decided to get to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A"> hotel</a>, check-in, and then register for the Convention.</p><p>After doing such things, we got something to eat at The Islander in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1"> Pike Market Place</a> area.  It was some of the most delicious shrimp I've ever tasted.  We walked around the Pike Market Place a little more afterwards, and then headed back to the hotel.  Then i slept for 14 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday Afternoon</b></div><p>Saturday, i finally got around to calling everybody and we met up with Hilary for lunch in the International District.  We ate at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A"> Fu-Lin Chinese Restaurant</a>, where the Ramen actually tasted like ramen from the Cafeteria at Nagasaki GaiDai in all of its' bland, rubbery, waxy, noodley, fatty, yet tasty flavor.  In the same area, just happened to be an import toy / video game / model / figure store, entitled <a href="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php" title="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php" title="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php">Pink Godzilla</a>.  It's interesting to see how much these import stores hike up the prices for the 'demand' in America.</p><p>I did end up purchasing Trigger Heart Exelica on the Dreamcast, though.  There was about a $5 markup compared to the Japanese price, so it wasn't really that big a rip.</p><div class='title'><b>Cultural Divide</b></div><p>Something that rather surprised me was how large the Asian population is in Seattle.  Out here in Madison and up in Minneapolis, you'll catch a couple Asian Americans around.  Perhaps a couple more actual Asians in the South Union area, but the vast majority is Caucasian and African American.  In Seattle, there's a greater balance of the 3.</p><p>Obviously, since we're on the West coast, this is the original landing point for most Asian immigrants.  It's real interesting to see some customs that have transfered over and similarities between Japan in particular.</p><p>From what Ace and Jess told us about the weather, the lowest the temperature ever gets is around 35 to 40, and the highest it has gotten for them was around the 90s.  This weather is nearly identical to Nagasaki, according to what I've experienced and what #five has told me.</p><p>The garbage is far more recycling friendly as well.  In Japan, you separate burnable, non-burnable, bottles and cans when you throw away your trash.  All the public places I've been in around the west just have one single Garbage can that you dump everything into.  However, Seattle has garbage divisions much like Japan, separated by normal trash, paper, cans, and bottles.  Almost every public garbage can i saw had these four divisions.  No wonder the environment looks so damn beautiful.</p><p>Also, Seattle has quite a bit of Sakura and White Plum trees.  I was rather disappointed that i missed out on Sakura trees blossoming in Japan, but Seattle made up for it with its own blossoming beauties.  I'm not sure why i didn't take any pictures.. :/  I suppose the similar weather and immigrants were responsible for the healthy Sakura population around the city.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakura-Con</b></div><p>Anyways, Saturday was the day that we really spent our time at the Con, unless you count the hour and a half spent in line the previous day.

Mainly the mailman from Twilight Princess and a huge costume of Robo from Chrono Trigger.  I'm sure you could just go over to that fan-something website and see them along with some of the other beautiful j-pop cosplayers.</p><p>Honestly, we really didn't do a whole lot at the Convention itself.  We walked around the dealer's room quite a bit.  Jesse not only got one of his Penny Arcade books signed by either Tycho or Gabe, but nearly defeated one of them in Puzzle Quest.  I also pissed off one of import game dealers commenting on his prices compared to those in Japan.</p><p>The gaming rooms were pretty disappointing.  Microsoft dominated one of the rooms with 360 stuff, while the other rooms had a ton of single player games.  Guilty Gear was the only traditionally fighting game present.  Dead or Alive 4 and, of course, Smash Brothers were the next closest :/  sadness...</p><div class='title'><b>As day turns to Night</b></div><p>All Saturday has been rather cloudy and rainy.  Ace and Jess confirmed that it did rain quite a bit, but never the down pours we experience in the Midwest.  The weather is usually overcast with a misty like rain that doesn't really get you wet..  So, you rarely get good beautiful days (like Friday), but you also rarely get snow, thunderstorms, and other severe weather.</p><p>After much decision making, we decided to go back to the fish Market, and go to Pike's place for dinner, where we had the most delicious meal of the trip.  I had stuffed Smoked Salmon with Spinach, along with several of their brewed beers.  Fantastic..</p><p>Afterwards, Ace and Jess showed us around to some of the attractions, such as the gum wall:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" /></p><p>A wall covered with used pieces of chewing gum.

Jesse was somewhat regretful that we didn't spend enough time at the Convention.  After all, that was our main reason of going to Seattle.  I think my whole time of going to Anime Conventions is coming to an end.  I'm really only interesting in what the dealers are selling, and what games are available in the game room.  This Con really failed at both for me, despite its large size.  The cosplayers were rather fantastic though.</p><p>One reason that <a href="http://nobrandcon.com/" title="http://nobrandcon.com/" title="http://nobrandcon.com/">No Brand Con</a> trumps all other Anime Conventions i've attended is their phenomenal game room, surprising vendors, and the 'No Mercy' room which plays Bad Anime and J-Drama.  Plus No Brand Con is at such a small scale that you actually meet people and see them throughout the weekend, rather than just once.</p><p>Even though it was just a simple weekend, i'll definitely be back up there for the <a href="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/" title="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/" title="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/">Penny Arcade Expo</a> at the end of August.  Perhaps this time, i'll find time to actual go out and listen to some music.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to McFarlane Lost Toys" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mcfarlane-lost-toys">McFarlane Lost Toys</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 29, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>i was browsing 4chan today and came across several threads about tonight's episode of LOST.  One the posts was some comment about how they brought back all the characters that have died into all the flashbacks, but the photo for the post was a figure of Artz.  It looked like any 'ol crappy action figure, but it was still a LOST figure.  How awesome would it be to get a Jack figure and have him yelling at the Locke figure for a couple seasons or two..  Kickass awesome, that's how awesome.</p><p>I hopped on google and typed in 'lost figures' and what i found was far more than i bargained for.  Apparently McFarlane Toys picked up the rights for LOST figures.  Collecting McFarlane Toys had been one of my favorite hobbies back in high school and art college..  allow me to elaborate:</p><div class='title'><b>Back in the day...</b></div><p>I think i've always been a collector at heart.  I started off on baseball cards and garbage pal kids cards, like most kids growing up in the 80s.  I didn't really have a ton of money, so cards were really the perfect fit.  I could easily spare $1 or 2 after school to hit my local Ben Franklin (now turned into John's Variety and Pets).  Collecting cards really began the whole aspiration to completing something.  Acquiring an entire set of a specific item of this world.  Striving for completion.  Finishing what you started, and searching wide and far to accomplish your goal.  etc, etc, etc.</p><p>With collecting anything, you began to acquire a lot of excess that you don't really care about.  You usually become caught in the moment that you gloss over the fact that most things are a waste of money.  Oh well.. I'm American and this is how our country works.</p><p>Anyways, in high school i began working at Toys R Us, and lemme tell you.  Giving a kid an income at store that sells things intended for short-term entertainment value will start eating away at said income, unless they have a strong will, very good tastes, sensibility towards money or simply realize that toys are really a huge waste of money that companies make a huge premium because they are cheap pieces of crap.  Thankfully, at the time, i was in the mindset that toys are cheap pieces of crap.</p><p>However, that changed when i ran across my first glimpse of McFarlane figures.</p><div class='title'><b>Todd's Toys / McFarlane Toys</b></div><p>We had a few aisles of action figures at Toys R Us: mostly 7c and 8c though.  Most action figures are cheap pieces of crap.  They were army figures that stood straight and stoic, horribly painted, and solid colored accessories.  They were wrestling figures that all had the same body, slightly changed outfits by color or paint jobs only, and faces that looked nothing like the actual wrestler.  They were movie figures that also looked nothing like the actual actor, had no consistency of size between different movie franchises, and usually came with so many extra accessories that were never actually featured in the movie.</p><p>In a neatly straighten, plastic garden sea of mediocrity, McFarlane toys blew everything out of the water.  The first figures i laid eyes on were Spawn series 6 and 7.  These figures looked beautiful.  Faces actually had discernible features, clothing actually looked soft and flowing like real clothing, the color used represented earth tones normally found in actual human clothing.  It looked like someone ACTUALLY spent time and care making these figures, rather than just pumping out something for kids to buy.</p><p>The beauty of the figures were only matched by the medium.  You had Alien Spawn with a dark dimly painted body, wrapped in tentacles.  The Freak had actual hair, a famished physique, and baggy pants.  Each figure in this set looked drastically different than the next.  Each figure had a different posture, different build, different color, different head.</p><p>I fell in love ^_^</p><p>As new series came out, each figure became darker looking, darker colored, and more dramatic poses.  When the Spawn movie was released in the theaters, i caught the 'making of' special on the Sci Fi channel.  Todd talked about the movie, and in the last segment he talked about the figures.  During this time, he went through the process of creating his figures, and his vision of what his figures should be.</p><p>He said that he would tell his assistants that once they finished painting a figure and they think they had it just right, throw it on the ground.  "Kick it around in the dust and dirt and completely soil your paint job...  Then it'll look exactly how i want it."  He want on to explain, "These figures are representative of some happy love story environment..  These are characters in a dark, dirty world with corruption, sleaze, and villainy.  They should not only look the part, but feel it."  This is the love that goes into McFarlane Toys.</p><div class='title'><b>Coming of Age..</b></div><p>Todd really loves his toys.  He brought his comic book (Spawn) to life within his figures, and made them in his own vision.  In 1997 and 1998, He began to branch out and do this with other properties as well.  He branched to video games with his Metal Gear Solid figures, movies with Austin Powers and his Movie Maniacs series, and into music with The Beatles Yellow Submarine and Kiss.  He began making figures of his favorite franchises in the way he wanted them to look.</p><p>This move was business genius.  His figures know grabbed the attention of a much wider audience and was able to boost sales considerably.  Though, i like to think he was still making figures for himself.  This next move was proof of that.</p><p>In the year 2000, his figures branched into another one of his favorite hobbies: Baseball and other sports.  After buying Mark Mcguire's final homerun baseball of that season, he released his Baseball, Hockey and Football figures.  Again, he began making the figures he wanted, while making yet another genius business move.  Sales climbed exponentially, as he continued to release more figures.  I mean, who the hell wouldn't want a beautifully action posed 6 inch figure of their favorite sports star.</p><p>This was about the time i quit Toys R Us, i moved out of state to Wisconsin when i wanted a new start at college, rather than finishing art school.  Since i was no longer in direct contact with McFarlane figures, and didn't have that first contact with a new shipment of figures, I began to loose touch.  I checked spawn.com every now and then, but i really didn't have a community of spawn figure collectors to talk with or gain knowledge from..  so touch was lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Collecting the figures.</b></div><p>When it came to actually buying figures, a figure had to meet 1 of 2 criteria: rare or awesome.  I usually picked up the rare figure in each new series unless i just didn't like it, but whenever i came across a figure that looked awesome, i picked up that one as well, despite rarity...  hell, that's the reason you buy action figures in the first place.</p><p>McFarlane figures were always distributed to be collected.  Most figure series had 6 figures and came in a case of 12, which generally contained 2 or 3 of each common figure, and then one figure of the series intentionally distributed to be rare.  There will always be one figure that comes 1 per case, and usually it's the most scantly clad female figure of the group, or the most kickass figure of the group.</p><p>To further the collectability scheme, each series generally had 'first edition' figures.  These were figures first off the production line.  They were inspected and sometimes changed slightly, to fix errors or just improve upon.  Then the actual production of the figures commenced.  At Toys R Us we usually got a case or two of these first edition figures.  Months after the line had been in the market, McFarlane would go back and repaint this series in all new colors, and then release them again.  Generally, any given series of McFarlane figures had at least 3 separate versions of a single figure.</p><p>First editions usually don't go for too much more than regular editions.  Some of the time they are seriously flawed, which is why they were changed.  This is especially the case with one of my favorite figures: Manga Spawn from Spawn series 10.  Manga Spawn has a chain that goes from one hip bone to the other.  The first editions had a plastic chain, with huge chain links.  It looked gawd awful.  The regular version featured a metallic chain like a necklace, with tiny links and a gold shimmer.</p><p>The rare figures are always worth more, and can sometimes be next to impossible to find for an older series.  When McFarlane got the rights to the Matrix Reloaded/Revolution toys.  Each case of 20 figures, contained only one of 2 twins.  Prices for these figures immediately shut up to $35 each, and continued to climb.  They are pretty cheap these days, though.  $20 each on ebay, right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Through the dormant years</b></div><p>These past years, i've rarely glanced at spawn.com to see what has come out.  Honestly, my primary collecting efforts have turned to video games.  But whenever i find myself at a Toys R Us, i make sure to check out their figures.  Toys R Us has the best assortment of McFarlane Toys, and if you visit one less traveled, you can usually find the rare figures easily.</p><p>I have 4 personal favorites that i've collected over the years, in order of release: <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802">Manga Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793">Mandarin Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138">Wings of Redemption Spawn</a>, and <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519">Gunslinger Spawn</a>.  I would gladly take photos, if i actually had them here with me, but they are at home, displayed on my other shelves.</p><p>One of my favorite figures he has made that i do not own is <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844">Armchair Morpheus</a> from Matrix figure series 2.  Though, it looks pretty cheap on ebay. Also, i missed out on <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658">Mandarin Spawn 2</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>Anyways, Back to Today, McFarlane has the rights to produce figures of LOST and they look amazing.  Series 1 of the LOST figures came out November 2006, and feature Charlie, Locke, Jack, Kate, Shannon, and Hurley as regular figures, plus the deluxe boxset of the Hatch.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318</a></p><p>Like all McFarlane figures, they look simply amazing.  Of course, these photos are of the original sculpture by Todd McFarlane, and are then used to create the mold.  The final figures are based off this mold, so the most dynamic curves will smooth out a tad, and the paint job will be just a little more efficient too.</p><p>Out of series 1, the Locke figure is striking, but i think the best figure is definitely Charlie.  I would actually open that one in put it on my desk, window sill, or shelf.  I might open up the Locke figure, depending on how it actually looks.  They actually come in boxes, so the can be resealed rather easily without damaging the packaging.  huzzah.  I bet Shannon's figure is the rare one of the set.  Though, they should've made a figure of her getting shot.  I think that would've been more meaningful.</p><p>Upon further inspection, series 2 of LOST figures are released in July 2007.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346</a></p><p>Jin's figure is pretty awesome, but overall rather bland.  The other figures are the same..  What's up with the Sun figure, though?  Is that really the most representative pose for her from LOST?  hmmm..  i suppose that was the episode where she was finally able to be free from Jin's suppression.</p><p>ahh... sweet sweet consumerism.  hmm.  After all this reminiscing i forgot all about those crappy LOST figures.</p><p><b>Edit:</b> Whooo.. i picked up The Hatch Playset at Toys R Us yesterday.  It was clearanced down to $15, so i could not say No.  I was rather surprised that $15 was the same price as the individual figures though.  Quite Pricey.  They were completely sold out of the Locke figure, had plenty of Charlie figures, and equal amounts of the other figures.  It would seem rarity is based on popularity this time, unless Locke is the intentionally rare figure of the set.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/14">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/12">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
