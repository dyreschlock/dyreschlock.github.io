And through learning the language, her thought process changes, her perception of time begins to change, and she’s able to view parts of her future. Because she’s able to understand and process their language, she’s able to think like them and perceive time like them.</p><p>This is the central plot of the movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Human Examples</b></div><p>Let’s go back to our previous sentence, and compare it with some other languages.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.<br/>Je marche à l'école tous les jours.<br/>Yo camino a la escuela todos los dias.<br/>Ich gehe taglich zur Schule.</code></p><p>There’s English, French, Spanish, and German.  Each has its own sound and ring, but the basic sentence structure is the same.  I walk.  Je marche.  Yo camino.  Ich gehe.</p><p>The very first thing we care about in the sentence is "who" followed immediately by "what is he/she/it doing."  After that, everything else is details.</p><p>I think this is because our culture, personalities, and attitudes tend to be very direct.  Or we tend to favor people and ideas that are very direct.  If we can quickly and succinctly communicate the who/what and it’s action, we can understand the idea faster and fuller.</p><p>So, how does this compare with Japanese.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は毎日学校に歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>First is the subject (<span class='ja'>私</span> <i>watashi</i> or I), but the verb is the very last thing in the sentence (<span class='ja'>行きます</span> <i>ikimasu</i> go).  All of the other details are explained before the actual actions.  I think this is because Japanese language and culture tends to be indirect a lot of the time.</p><p>The Japanese teacher in class went on to give some examples of indirectness in Japanese, such as refusing an invitation.  In English, when refusing an invitation, we typically say something like, "Sorry, I can’t" or "I’m busy," and then maybe followed by a reason.  The refusal can be softer, but typically the first thing we say is very direct, "I can’t."</p><p>In Japanese, such directness could be considered rude or harsh, so the polite way to refuse is to be more indirect.  "Sorry.  On that day, I’ll be out of town"  or "Sorry, I already have another engagement on that day."  There’s no real reason to say "I can’t" because it’s implied, and because of that those harsh words are never said.</p><div class='title'><b>Switching Brains</b></div><p>As long as I’ve been learning Japanese, people have always mentioned the idea that they’re able to "switch their brain" when fully immersed in Japanese.  They claim they think in Japanese and speaking Japanese becomes more natural to them.  Sometimes they need to stop for a second to switch from talking in one language to the other.  </p><p>This idea is the foundation behind the plot of <b>Arrival</b>.  Louise can change switch her brain when communicating in the alien language, and then be able to perceive her current and future memories at a single time.</p><p>This has never been the case for me.  Over these last 4 years of living here, and 15 years since first learning Japanese, I’ve really just maintained a single mode of thought.  My thought process always tends to translate and interpret the incoming Japanese into something I can understand.  Outgoing, too, has a quick translation from English to Japanese.</p><p>Though, this single mode of thought has changed and been molded over time by all the language and culture I’ve absorbed and learned by living here.  For certain kinds of grammar and vocabulary, I can say them pretty fast.  It just feels more instinctual rather than a complete switch.  Through practice, I feel like I’ve simply trained my brain rather than developed something completely separate.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Cove and Taiji, Wakayama 太地町" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama">The Cove and Taiji, Wakayama 太地町</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After paging through manga, single CDs, and other crap related to the RPG, I came across the very items that I never thought I would actually be able to find..</p><p>Animation cels from The Legend of Crystania.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5612_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Why would anyone want something from this shit anime?  Well, it's not the anime itself that's important, but that my friends and I re-wrote, and re-dubbed the movie over 10 years ago as part of our anime club in college.  Really, even calling it "The Legend of Crystania" feels weird as "The Secret of Crystania" is the real treasure.  Honestly, to this day, I still don't know the actual names of the characters other than Ashram and Pirotess.</p><p>We originally finished and screened The Secret on March 6th, 2006, so it was only last week that we hit the 10 year anniversary of our project's "completion."  If you'd like to give it a watch, take a look it this page: <a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">The Secret of Crystania</a>.</p><p>Among these 4 cels we have the main character, Billy Winchester, and the girl, Agora Miasma, whose name is never uttered in the film.  I went through the movie and found each of the frames these cels were attached to.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5615.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5615.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5615_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5615_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/IMG_5615_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/vlcsnap-2016-03-15-19h35m18s6.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/vlcsnap-2016-03-15-19h35m18s6.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160315_crystania/vlcsnap-2016-03-15-19h35m18s6.webp" /></div><br/></div><br/><br class="clr" /></p><p>The above scene happens around 17 minutes 44 seconds going by the time from the "Donut of Power Edition".

| February 8, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I found a new hobby lately.  These toys are a pretty hot item.  Almost everywhere in the U.S., they are sold out.  Even the common ones can be tough to find.  And the uncommon and rare ones?  They sell pretty well on eBay.</p><p>In Japan, though...  they are not so scarce.  And after returning from winter vacation, I've been buying the ones difficult to find and reselling them on eBay.  An alternate title for this entry might be <b>Confessions of an Amiibo Scalper</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Amiibo</b></div><p>First, What are Amiibos?  Amiibos are these things:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are figurines of Nintendo characters created by Nintendo.  But in addition to being a figurine, each one has a chip in its based and can be used with various games on the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.  The most prominent game being the new Super Smash Brothers title.</p><p>The first wave of these figures was released in November last year.  However, given Nintendo's risk aversion and general misunderstanding of their demographic and fan base, they did not create enough figures to match demand, and certain figures became incredibly rare quite fast, and extremely difficult to find.  Additionally, this was on the heals of Christmas, so they became quite a hot item, and demand continued to increase.</p><p>That's in the U.S., though.  In Japan, most people don't care that much about video games.  The 3DS is pretty popular, and most kids have those.  But most families do not have home consoles because they're expensive, and take over the family TV which should be shared by everyone.  Also, kids don't really care about Smash Brothers.  They're more interested in Yokai Watch and Monster Hunter.  So, Amiibos aren't selling nearly as much as the states.  Also, I think they've shipped more in Japan, than in the states (at least per capita).</p><p>Before winter vacation, I spent some time reading about all the horror stories of gamers trying to get their hands on these things.  I thought, really?  A few weeks prior I saw a full display of (maybe) all the figures at a Toys R Us.  The prices on eBay seemed to corroborate with the stories.  Some figures were selling for 3 times their MRSP.  One in particular, <i>The Villager</i>, was closer to 7 times.  Amiibo figures retail for $12.</p><p>After coming back to Japan from winter vacation, I hopped on the Amiibo bandwagon purely to resell them on eBay.</p><div class='title'><b>Waves</b></div><p>At that time, there had been 2 release waves of figures.  From the first wave, <i>The Villager</i>, <i>Marth</i>, and <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i> were the uncommon or rare figures.  Though, I think <i>Samus</i>, and <i>Fox</i> are getting hard to find now.  From the second wave, <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> became quickly scarce.  <i>Captain Falcon</i> is starting to get rare, too.</p><p>In Tokyo, before returning to Takayama, I went to a few Toys R Us's and other stores, and easily found plenty <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I could not find any <i>Villagers</i>, though.  Those were actually rare in Japan, too.  After returning to Takayama, I found a <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Captain Falcon</i>, plus plenty more <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I've never seen a <i>Pitt</i>, either.</p><p>In January, Nintendo released their third wave of figures.  These figures would be released in the U.S. a few weeks later.  But, in the U.S., four of these figures were retailer exclusive, meaning you couldn't figure them just anywhere.  That was not the case in Japan.  These figures were <i>Rosalina</i> exclusive to Target, <i>Lucario</i> exclusive to Toys R Us, <i>Meta Knight</i> exclusive to Best Buy, and <i>Shulk</i> exclusive to Gamestop.  These seemed like they would be the most difficult to find in the states, so when they released in Japan, I bought plenty of each.  (Shulk has yet to release in Japan, though.)</p><div class='title'><b>Buying in Rural Japan</b></div><p>In large cities, you have tons of options, but out here in the forest and the mountains, the choices are much more limited.  Takayama isn't all that bad, though.  We have a Geo <span class='ja'>ゲオ</span>, and an Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span>.  Both stores have full displays of Amiibos and received full shipments of Wave 3.  Apita <span class='ja'>アピタ</span> has 'em, too, but seemed like they only received half a shipment of Wave 3.  That rental store in Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> occasionally has some, too.</p><p>Here's the display at my local Edion, taken on Sunday.  They had plenty of the common figures, and a few of the uncommon ones.  This is in STARK contrast to any shelves in America where only <i>Peach</i> can easily be found.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This weekend, I decided to drive around the Hida <span class='ja'>飛騨</span> area and raid all the stores for their rare and uncommon Amiibo figures.  I drove south to Gero, then west to Gujo, and quickly further south to Seki.</p><div class='title'><b>Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span></b></div><p>Still within the Hida region, comprising the southern towns and villages is Gero City, with Hagiwara <span class='ja'>萩原</span>, and Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span> being its population centers.  These are about an hour away from Takayama.  In Hagiwara, there's a Yamada Denki <span class='ja'>ヤマダ電機</span> with a Techland.  And in Gero, there's another Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span> with a Neverland.  These distinctions are important.  Without a Techland, or Neverland, these stores only sell appliances.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Both stores were pretty light.  It seemed like they each only got half shipments on the figures.  The Edion in Gero was so small, but they somehow packed everything inside.  Amiibos weren't on the shelves.  I asked, and they had boxes of them in the back.  I shifted through and found another <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i>.  I bought a <i>Rosalina</i> and a <i>Meta Knight</i> from Yamada.

Geo had a decent selection, but there were all common figures.  Edion was similar.  At Edion, they didn't even have shelf space for the figures.  They just set up several peg hooks with tags you were meant to bring to the check out line.  A paged through the tags, but they were all common.  I asked if they had anything else in the back, but they just directed me to back to the shelf.

Nagoya may be a better choice.</p><p>Next week, Wave 4 will be released in Japan.

That's not particularly huge, but the boon is being able to convert my yen into dollars, and being able to transfer that into my back account.  This is amazing, and if I can sell enough of these things in a month, it totally mitigates my need to send money back to the U.S..</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think this is a renewable resource.  It's good for now.  I'll be able to make some cash in the short term.  But supply will continue to dwindle here in Japan.  And perhaps Nintendo will get its shit together and meet demand.  Who knows?  Best to strike while I can.</p><div class='title'><b>Lifetime Sales</b></div><p>It's been almost 7 years since I started selling things on eBay on a regular basis.  It started with a bunch of extra video games, movies, and action figures I had in my possession and no longer cared about.  I've written about this several times in the past.

I've spent the money on music and artists.  I've bought plenty of games, too.  Ultimately, it's just trading old stuff for new stuff.  Getting rid of the stuff that doesn't matter, and keeping what does.</p><p>I found my lifetime sales total on ebay the other day.  As of Sunday, February 8th, I've made nearly $10,000 reselling crap on eBay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, eBay doesn't really keep user records further back than 3 months, so there's no way to see a breakdown of this number.  I would love to see a chart of my highs and lows throughout the past decade.  At one point, I was selling so many things that I actually became a top seller. It didn't last long since my supply was never all that large.  I was only a top seller for 3 months (2 of which were the grace period at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I should easily top $10,000 by the end of the week.  Also, I'm getting pretty close to Top Seller status again thanks to Amiibo.

| December 17, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It has been nearly 2 years since I've been to a club, and actually heard some electronic dance music live.  After moving to Japan, I've focused on working in my remote town in the mountains.  But, this past weekend, I just happened to be free, and noticed that <b>Hernan Cattaneo</b> just happened to be nearby.  Way too coincidental to ignore.  I made the drive <a href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter" title="/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">from Takayama to Nagoya</a>, and went to see him.</p><div class='title'><b>Location</b></div><p>Club Mago is pretty easy to find.  It's a few blocks down from the Saeki area of Nagoya.  It's located within some standard looking building, which is currently under construction.  The club itself is on the 2nd floor of the basement, and shares the space with another venue.</p><p>Outside, there are plenty of open lots for parking.  Several were full when I arrived, but past 10 o'clock, those lots began to empty out, and there was plenty of space.  I parked in the lot directly across the street from the club.  At the end of the night, parking was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Inside, Club Mago is pretty small.  Once you get into the basement, you walk down a somewhat narrow hall, turn the corner, and are directly at the entry counter.  You pay your, and go inside.  There are two rooms.  </p><div class='title'><b>Space</b></div><p>The first room is fully lit, has several tables, and plenty of seating.  This area would probably feel like a club, if it weren't lit like someone's basement.  Stuffed around a corner in the room is a DJ spinning some lounge-y tunes.  And next to him is a food bar.</p><p>The next room has the main area.  Immediately to right when entering is the bar.  There are some seats at the bar, and across the way on the left tables and more seats.  The bar is maybe 12 or 15 feet long.  Then the room opens up into the dance area.</p><p>I feel like calling this place a "club" is a bit incorrect.  It's definitely a venue.  Past the bar, it's standing room only, and it's very dimly lit.  The floor, walls, and ceiling are painted black, and there's maybe 8 lighting rigs setup on the ceiling to illuminate the place.  It's not really flashy like I would imagine a club in a city as large as Nagoya to be.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Though, I think the real difference is that this place really doesn't have any offerings for V.I.Ps, or big spenders.  The dance floor is wide open for everyone.  There are no expensive drinks.  Cover charge is the same for everyone.  Everyone is the same.  This is way more characteristic of a venue than a club.</p><p>Obviously, there's nothing wrong with this.  I was just expecting something flashy and ridiculous as Japan often tends to do, but this was way more down to earth and normal.  I need to go to a club in Tokyo or Osaka and see how this compares.</p><div class='title'><b>Opener and DJ Ogawa</b></div><p>Though, upon entering, I definitely felt at home.  The opener prior to DJ Ogawa was spinning some familiar tunes I had heard recently on the Internet radio, and mixing them together quite well.  The first song was something off one of the recently Jody Wisternoff Intesifieds.  He mixed that into some remix of Delirium - After All.  The crowd was very sparse at this point.  There were probably around 20 people.  It was only 11pm, though.</p><p>The space began to fill up, little by little, and by midnight, DJ Ogawa took over.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He cranked out some pretty bangin' tunes, which certainly fired up the crowd.  I mentioned on Facebook that there were all rather predictable, though.  Predictable build, predictable release.  It was fine.  Certainly something the crowd needed in order to be ready for Hernan.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p>Hernan took over the decks around 1am.  According to Facebook, he was billed for a 5 hour set.  I really wonder if he kept going all the way 'til 6am.  I can't say, since I could not keep myself awake that late. :(</p><p>As he took over, his first tracks sustained the vibe built by Ogawa.  It was still a bangin' beat that kept the more energetic members of the crowd on their toes, and moving around.  Other members of the crowd weren't quite awake yet.</p><p>The crowd was yet another indication that I was at a venue, and not a club.  No one was really dressed to impress.  Most dudes that entered where simply wearing their street clothes.  Some were still wearing their backpacks, and bags.  Most dudes entered the dance floor, danced and rocked out with themselves.  Almost all of the crowds were dudes, really.  Very few woman.  Those that were there, really just danced and rocked out with themselves, too.  The crowd was really wholly comprised of music nerds and baseheads.</p><p>There were certainly outliers, though.  Mainly the western foreigners in the audience.  They actually came in groups, and danced with themselves.  They were drinking, yelling, and moving around the most.  They actually dressed up expecting this place to be an actual club.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At first, it seemed like Hernan was fighting the crowd.  He would play a bangin' track, and some members of the crowd began rocking out to it.  After the track, Hernan would pull back a little bit, and layer his songs.  It felt like he was building an atmosphere, a vibe.  He was really getting into his tracks, and letting us all see inside himself.</p><p>But the crowd didn't care.  As Hernan trailed making music, and building something, the crowd got bored, and mostly stopped moving.  Hernan threw back into more energetic songs to bring the crowd back on his side.  But when he trailed off again, the crowd didn't budge.  The crowd kinda sucked because it was a beautiful gorgeous vibe.  Any crowd from Chicago would've been following him completely.</p><p>Eventually he gave up, and turned his vibe far more energetic to appease the crowd.  Once Hernan changed and found the correct atmosphere for the crowd, the crowd completely woke up, and kept moving from that point on.  The more still crowd members began leaving as time went by.  Which left the true fans (and the drunk fans).  Past 3am, the crowd was amazing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Almost past 3am, I was starting to lose my energy.  I went back on the dance floor and rocked out for a while, but once I was out, I was done for the night.  I think I finally left around 4am.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>It was a pretty great night.  Though, it didn't really transform me in the way I was thinking.  When I was in the club and rocking with the music, I was no longer in Japan.  I was back in my music, and my vibe.  It was like any other club experience I've had back in the states.  I was no longer foreign.</p><p>This is a bit arrogant to say, but everyone else felt foreign like they didn't understand Hernan's vibe, and it took them a little while to adapt and change.  (Even though, Hernan was the one really changing his "tune".)</p><p>It was good to feel normal again.  Though, I've been away from the states long enough now, my "previous" life in the states is no longer normal for me.  Normal is coming back to Takayama and teaching these kids.</p><p>When I left the club, the musical vibe stayed with me.  But, as soon as I entered a convenience store to buy some water, I was back in Japan, and the music faded.  I was once again the foreigner, and out of place.  It's weird having my previous and current lives cross over each other.</p><p>Anyway, I'll certainly return there in the future when another fantastic DJ visits.  Great set by Hernan.  Hopefully I can stay awake next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hideaki Anno's Sci Fi Exhibit - Tokusatsu 特撮" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hideaki-anno-scifi-exhibit-tokusatsu">Hideaki Anno's Sci Fi Exhibit - Tokusatsu 特撮</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 6, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, legendary DJ Richie Hawtin came to Madison on his CNTRL Tour, which comes with the title "Beyond EDM".  The Beyond EDM moniker is the driving force behind this tour, and has several meanings behind itself.</p><p>Initially my thoughts were that "Beyond EDM" meant an exposure to other genres outside of the massive popularity of Electro House, Dubstep, Pop House, some Trance, and everything you hear on the radio, in most clubs, and so forth.  Many of the new kids to the scene don't realize the rich history and beautiful sounds of true House, Techno, and other more minimal genres that built the scene back in the day.</p><p>But, aside from exposure, the "Beyond EDM" meant something else, and something more.  In the strictest sense, "Beyond EDM" means there's more than just the music.</p><p>"Beyond EDM" means connections.  The wonderful thing about nearly all of electronic dance music is the community that supports it.  For those who are fans, it's about connecting with other fans and artists, supporting them, and sharing music.  For those who are artists, it's about reaching your fans, growing your fanbase, connecting with other artists, and supporting them too.  Support and Collaboration.</p><p>The best (and most unique) thing about Richie Hawtin's CNTRL tour was the education and community focus.  Earlier in the evening, Hawtin held a round-table style discussion and lecture at each of his tour stops, completely free.  Hawtin had 3 or 4 other panelists, and they would discuss various topics such as "the business of EDM", "EDM: Now and Then", "The evolving artist", etc.</p><p>In Madison, Hawtin held his lecture at the Madison Media Institute in southeast Madison.  It almost immediately sold out.  Along with Richie Hawtin, Kevin Saunderson, Ean Golden, Gaise, and Kurt Eckes, from Drop Bass Network all sat in front of us all and talked about EDM for about 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp"  /></p><p>The whole format was mostly question and answer, but the questions were a little bit leading, and were really more like prompts that guided the information the panelists wanted to say.</p><p>And I wrote a bunch of notes...</p><div class='title'><b>Rave Act</b></div><p>The first main topic of the night was history.  With the explosion of EDM today, we need to look at the past to make sure the same mistakes won't happen again.  Electronic dance music was rather prevalent in the late 90s with the rave scene, but it died out.  What happened?</p><p>This question was directed at Kurt Eckes.  Eckes is one of the founders of the Drop Bass Network, a company responsible for some of the largest rave events across the midwest in the mid 90s to the 2000s.  So, what killed his events?</p><p>Kurt had a few answers, but his main answer was the Rave Act, and the negative publicity of raves in general.  The Rave Act basically slammed an event where any illegal substance was found with a massive fine.  Cops would have the authority to raid any event they believed had a substance, and run through everyone there until they found something, or were satisfied enough, and left.</p><p>This was a huge bummer for several reasons.  Kurt admitted that nearly all of the parties he put on were illegal.  They never checked for drugs, and they pretty much didn't care.  After the Rave Act was introduced, it was way too risky to continue the way they were.  Hiring a bunch of security guards was a bummer.  And if, on the off chance, a party attendee brought something, and the Cops raided the place, he'd be slammed by the law.</p><p>Aside from that, other companies that did throw legal parties were still getting busted.  The cops would shut down the music, have everyone on the ground, and comb the place for an hour.  That's not a fun night for anyone, whether or not they actually find something.</p><p>The Rave Act killed the fun, and made everything too damn risky.  And Kurt's personal interest in the business was beginning to wane, and it just felt like too much damn work to go through all the red tape.</p><div class='title'><b>Clubs</b></div><p>One solution to the problem was to move the scene into the clubs.  But this had its own problem.  The club scene is not the rave scene.  Aside from banning illegal substances, clubs had strict operating hours.  Most of the places in the midwest had to close at 3am.  Most raves went until dawn, or even past dawn, continued through the next day, and night.  Raves never stop, but clubs certainly do.</p><p>The Rave kids just weren't into the club scene, so they just didn't go.  And with raves dying out, they had nowhere to go, and basically quit the music scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Shorter Sets</b></div><p>Even the artists had to adapt to the time restrictions.  DJs could no longer spin a 5 or 6 hour set on their own, they only had a time slot of an hour or 2.  True DJs don't play song after song after song, they play a set.  Songs are chosen to build off of each other, and tell a story.  6 hours is plenty of time to tell a story and try out new things.  But now that time has shrunk.  You can't tell a 6 hour story in just one hour.  There's not enough time to build, and have variety.  And instead of having 30 minutes to build up, you only have about 3.</p><p>There's very little time to be creative and flesh out anything new, too.  Hawtin mentioned that he really needs a good 4 hour set to try out new things.</p><p>To tell all that you want to tell, you need to build the intensity much faster with the shorter sets.  The story is condensed, and faster.</p><div class='title'><b>Larger Shows</b></div><p>Richie Hawtin asked the question, "Was the scene blowing up because of Skrillex, or did Skrillex blow up so fast because of how fast the scene grew?"  Obviously both the scene and Skrillex benefitted from each other greatly, but which one really started it?</p><p>Deadmau5 and Skrillex have raised the bar with the amount of production put into their stage performance at their shows.  But with the larger scale shows, this is so many more things that can go wrong.  Everything must be choreographed, and perfect for the show to be a hit.  Failure can be easy, so these DJs don't take as many risks anymore.  They can't.  They have to stick to a schedule, and can't be as flexible.</p><p>In fast, Deadmau5, who never considered himself a DJ in the first, really doesn't consider his artist persona his main job anymore.  He says that his title is an "event driven marketer."</p><div class='title'><b>Music Sales Today</b></div><p>Another big difference between the scene today and yesterday is that Music does not sell the way it used to, which is really due to piracy.  The whole panel really didn't slam piracy at all while they were up there.  Exposure is exposure.  It's just another vehicle to get your music out there and heard.</p><p>Hawtin gave the comparison that the scene was about a tenth of the size back in the day, but they sold about 10 times more records.  Which is incredible to think of.  But!  They were selling actual records.  These days, you can buy a whole album for $2 on the internet (or just pirate it).  And there's a ridiculous amount of competition.</p><p>Piracy is real and the competition, and the artist needs to be aware of these things.  You cannot survive on record sales alone.  You have to go out and perform your music, and personally spread your unique sound.</p><p>Which means you have to think of the whole package when composing music.  You have to know exactly how you're going to play your track, and design the track itself to be heard live.  And, your music ends up being advertising for your live show, and your message.</p><p>That last part is definitely true for me.  These days, if I hear something I like, I seek out the artist, and if I really like what they're doing, I want to see them live.  The live experience is a completely different monster than hearing something on the computer, or the iphone.  It is the whole package.</p><div class='title'><b>Balancing performance and creation</b></div><p>Building music and advertise your music means that you'll be out on the road and in the clubs a lot.  Hawtin finds himself having to schedule time to actually create tracks...  which is difficult.  You can't schedule creativity.  You need to be prepared to act when inspiration strikes.</p><p>And that isn't all that hard these days.  A lot of the music people make is on their laptops, and the very laptops they bring around with them to perform.  Going from studio work to club performance is nearly seamless.  You can perform works in progress, and really craft your tracks on the fly.</p><div class='title'><b>Copy Cats</b></div><p>It's really easy to make music today.  It's great for the artists, but it has opened the door for a lot of imitation and unoriginality.</p><p>You can take someone else's idea and run with it if you like, but people aren't as stupid as you think.  Fans and other artists are very in tune with what they hear and what they like and can spot a fake almost immediately.  They see right through them.</p><p>If you have no substance, authenticity, or originality, then you won't get far.  You have to be you.  Be natural.  Be genuine.  And the distinctiveness will shine with time.</p><div class='title'><b>Technology</b></div><p>The next question asked if anyone on the panel found it difficult to be creative with the massive influx of technology in the scene.</p><p>Hawtin replied with, "Technology opened up music creatively for me."  (or something like that.  damn autocorrect.)</p><p>He posed the question to the audience, "Do you really really care if the DJ is using the sync function on stage?"  Most of the audience basically just said no.</p><p>He continued by stating that Beat Matching is really is more mechanical than creative.  The machines we use today are WAY more precise than a record and a turntable.  DJ no longer have to chase records, and constantly make sure everything is synced up.  Technology today is incredibly liberating.  It gives the DJ peace of mind.</p><p>As such, they're able to be more creative and complex.  Hawtin can blend more than just two tracks together, and build a more unique layered sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp"  /></p><p>He demonstrated what he meant by that.  He went over to his laptop, and ran some sounds with each other using Traktor.  He had one track supply the baseline, while he blended the melody of two other tracks on top of that, and a fourth track with some samples.  This kind of thing is just not feasible with turntables.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment</b></div><p>The next train of thought went to the environment.  While the music should stand on its own, you're kidding yourself if you don't think the environment doesn't enhance the music.  Whether it be the crowd, or visuals, or being animated on stand, the environment is part of the performance.  It's part of building that moment for the audience.  And for some people, it's the catalyst that launches them into music, and transports them to another place.</p><div class='title'><b>Be Proactive</b></div><p>The scene is build on the idea of DIY, Do It Yourself.  Don't wait for someone to discover you, get out there and do it yourself!  Connect with everyone around you, and build your vision.  Reach out!</p><p>As you build your sound, let people in.  Accept criticism.  Accept help.  And give help back.  Be transparent, share idea, and include those interested around you.  That's how this scene was originally built in the first place!</p><p>Celebrate our diverse opinions, and grow!</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>Experimentation with your inspiration is how you find yourself.</p><p>Saunderson mentioned that one of the first things he ever did was attempt to copy a sound, or copy a feeling.  He would hear something, and try to recreate it from scratch in the studio.  And out of building toward that sound, the feeling, he found his own sound.  It was what he heard, but now it was through his own voice.</p><p>While copying things outright is rather opaque, you need to start somewhere.  Chasing what you like will give you direction.  And through that journey, you will find yourself.  You just need to keep at it.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>There were a couple more topics, but those were all the notes that I wrote down.  Hawtin ended the lecture with a rather inspirational quote, <b>"Dig deeper and continue to explore.  This is an incredible time.  Don't be disillusioned because popstars are making EDM tunes."</b></p><p>These times are pretty exciting.  I've met more people in the last 2 years into this kind of music, that I have ever met before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Majestic</b></div><p>I met up with Bryan after the lecture, we had dinner, and then we went to The Majestic, where the panelists performed.  Ean Golden started off the evening with an eclectic selection of tracks that went back and forth a little too rapidly for me.</p><p>The night began for me when Gaiser took the stage, and performed live.  Beautiful, rich, heavy Techno.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Kevin Saunderson took the stage, and blended some beautiful House tracks together.  Followed up by Richie Hawtin.  Absolutely incredible night.</p><p>The whole package was something truly unique and special: an education and a mind blowing performance.</p><p>Also, I broke my goddamn camera :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gainax Interviews" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gainax-interviews">Gainax Interviews</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 27, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I was cruising on ebay the other day, and came across this little gem.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp"  /></p><p>As you can tell from the picture, it's entitled the <b>Gainax Interviews</b>.  Published in 2005, this is a 536 page book featuring very lengthy interviews with almost everyone remotely noteworthy who has ever been a part of <b>Gainax</b>.</p><p>For those who don't know, Gainax is a Japanese Animation Studio responsibility for such anime movies and television shows as <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, <b>Gunbuster</b>, <b>Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water</b>, <b>Neon Genesis Evangelion</b>, <b>His and Her Circumstances</b>, <b>FLCL</b>, <b>Gurren Lagann</b>, <b>Panty and Stocking</b>, and a couple others, mostly maid anime.</p><p>I've been a fan of Gainax ever since I first watched Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Akira initially showed me how detailed and brutal Japanese animation can be, but Evangelion showed me the amount of depth most anime go into when describing and building a character while still having some amazing animated scenes.</p><p>I watched their other work, and they continued to impress and amaze me.  More over, I began completely amazed by the director and chief creative input behind many of their shows, Hideaki Anno.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp"  /></p><p>The book has a sizable interview with him.  I can't really read Japanese (yet), but above the specific question deals with the work he did before he, Takeda, Masayuki, and Higuchi banded together to form Gainax.  He worked as a key animation on the Gundam series for Sunrise, and, as the photo in the corner indicates, he got his big break key animating the God Warrior scene at the end of Ghibli's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.</p><p>Aside from Anno, the book focuses on the interviews of 15 people who helped shape Gainax throughout the years.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp"  /></p><p><b>Yasuhiro TAKEDA</b> : co-founder, general manager<br/><b>Hideaki ANNO</b> : co-founder, creator of Evangelion, director of Evangelion, Nadia, Gunbuster, His and Her Circumstances, and some others<br/><b>Masayuki</b> : assistant and alternate director of Evangelion<br/><b>Yoshiyuki SADAMOTO</b> : co-founder, character designer for Honneamise, Evangelion, Nadia<br/><b>Toshimichi OHTSUKI</b> : producer of Evangelion, FLCL<br/><b>Hiroki SATO</b> : producer of FLCL and most of their maid anime shows<br/><b>Masahiko OHTSUKI</b> : technical director of FLCL, Evangelion, and some others<br/><b>Shinji HIGUCHI</b> : co-founder, storyboards and special effects for Honneamise, Gunbuster, Evangelion.

Originally published in 2002 in Japan, ADV translated and brought this book over in 2005.</p><p>Takeda talks about meeting Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and Shinji Higuchi in college, and forming an Anime club.  Together they, and a couple other members, worked on an opening animation for the upcoming Sci Fi convention being held in Osaka that year, Daicon III.  The year was 1981.</p><p>The way he talks and reminiscences about their work on Daicon III reminds me of my own time in college in my own anime club, SPAMM, as we worked on a film of our own, The Secret of Crystania (which is really a fandub, not a complete original work).  And much like both of our projects, they were finished only an hour or two before it aired to the public.</p><p>You can view the whole short film on Youtube, as well as the amazing sequel, Daicon IV, that they did 2 years later.</p><p>Daicon III : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c</a><br/>Daicon IV : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE</a></p><p>With the completion of Daicon IV, they founded Daicon Film which specialized in special effects and animation. Later on, the special effects business splintered off, and the remnants became <b>Gainax</b>. In the beginning, the mostly did animation work for Sunrise (Gundam), but later created original works that I mentioned above.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway...</b></div><p>The Gainax Interviews looks like a fascinating read into the history of my favorite Anime studio, and I look forward to reading it someday.  It's my goal to someday have enough knowledge of the Japanese language to actually read this thing.  Maybe, at that time, I'll actually work to translate the whole thing since it doesn't seem like a translation exists.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wavefront Music Festival - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wavefront-music-festival-day-2">Wavefront Music Festival - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 12, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Saturday was pretty fun, I was really looking forward to today, Sunday.  Today we have Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, Eric Prydz, and Sasha.  Guy Gerber has been solidifying his name among the best in the business over the last couple of years.  Eric Prydz has been HUGE in all the circles of electronic music.  And Sasha is a living legend.  Sasha's involvement guaranteed my sale from the first day tickets went on sale.</p><p>Five and I woke up from our long day of music, and finally left the house around Noon Thirty, I think.  The skies were pretty clear, but there were some bizarre storm warnings that came across the morning news and the weather reports.  One report announced a Severe Thunderstorm warning from 12:45 to 1:30, which we thought was odd.  The radar had absolutely no storm activity in the Chicago area.</p><p>We were directly West of downtown a couple of miles, so our plan was to drive down Lake St., then north up Michigan Ave, to Lake Shore Dr., and then get to the beach.  During the 20 minutes it took us to drive 4 miles to Michigan Ave, the sky turned completely dark.  Huge black clouds surrounding down Chicago.  And winds blew around all kinds of trash and debris.  People walking around on the streets quickly went inside of building to shield themselves for the horror that was about to dump in the downtown area.</p><p>Five and I turned onto Michigan Ave, and got onto Lake Shore Dr. pretty quickly.  Over Lake Michigan there were clear blue skies, but looking West was the direct opposite.  Five continued to drive north, and the clouds emptied on to the city.  We seemed to escape it, though, as only a couple of drops hit our car.  We passed a couple of downed trees by the beach, where everyone was evacuating.</p><p>We reached Montrose beach, which is about 6 miles north of downtown.  All of the storm clouds really stayed directly over Chicago.  There were gray clouds above where we were, but the really dark horrific ones were south.  It was very bizarre.</p><p>Rather than head out to the beach in the middle of a storm, Five and I walked to a nearby restaurant to meet up with our pal, Brian, to wait out the storm.  40 minutes later, we exited the restaurant.  The skies were a little gray, but the storm definitely passed.  By the time, we actually got to the opening gate for Wavefront, you couldn't even tell that a storm was there.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp"  /></p><p>Well, except for the line of people waiting to get in.  Wavefront shut down, and evacuated everyone for 2 hours for fear of storm damage.  A fire department helicopter was circling the beach, and accessing the current weather before Wavefront could proceed with its event.  We were in line only a little while before the Fire department gave the go ahead, and people were admitted entrance.</p><p>Five, Brian, and I made it in around the same time we got in on Saturday, about 3pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp"  /></p><p>I went straight over to the North Stage to see who was on deck.  <b>Danny Daze</b> was spinning a fantastic groovy House set to welcome the crowd back into the festival.</p><p>By the way, along the sides of each stage were a bunch of VIP cabanas.  The North Stage had 3 big ones, and 4 smaller ones.  Each of those Large cabanas cost $10000 to rent for the weekend.  They included plenty of accommodations on top of the prime real estate, but yikes...  I think I'd rather buy a car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>We wandered around a little bit though, and found ourselves over at the South Stage, where <b>Betatraxx</b> was spinning a rather hilarious set.</p><p>The tracks he played was a perfect example of why a lot of people don't take dubstep seriously.  He played a dubstep remix of the <b>Requiem for a Dream</b> epic ending song.  He followed it up with a dubstep remix of the <b>Epic Fight Music</b>.  And then went into a dubstep remix of <b>NES Punch Out</b>.  After which he threw in some classical music, and other dubstep remixes of random well known songs.  It's a prime example of pandering to the crowd for cheap cheers rather than actually building an incredible vibe that stands on its own.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp"  /></p><p>We were really just waiting around for <b>Nadia Ali</b> and <b>Chris Lake</b> to show up.  Nadia was supposed to start at 4pm, but the time came and went without her on stage.  Then 4:30pm rolled around, and Chris Lake didn't show up either.  I guess they were delayed because of the freak weather earlier.</p><p>A local DJ took the stage not too long after 4:30.  He was only up there for 20 minutes or so before Chris Lake arrived and took over the controls.</p><p>The crowd was certainly into it, but my attention headed back to the North Stage.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp"  /></p><p>At 5pm, <b>Benoit &amp; Sergio</b> started to perform their set on the North Stage, and that's basically where I stayed for the rest of the day.  They played a fantastic set that was both mellow and energetic and played perfectly off the crowd.  Their set rolled perfectly into <b>Guy Gerber</b> who continued with the beautiful vibe.  He didn't tear down the vibe, or try to change it.  He built on the sound Benoit &amp; Sergio started and subtly crept in his own sound.  Seamless.</p><p>And what Guy Gerber started, <b>Steve Lawler</b> built upon.  He absolutely set me on fire.  I don't know why I had a negative opinion of him before, but his set was the perfect build up.  Everything started with Benoit &amp; Sergio into Guy Gerber into Steve Lawler, and just kept building and building, hour after hour.  I was so lost in the atmosphere that I could not care one bit that <b>Eric Prydz</b> was on the South Stage.  I could not pull myself away from Steve Lawler.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp"  /></p><p>And as the clock hit 8:30pm, the stage rotated around for <b>Sasha</b>, and much like the DJs before him, he continued to build.  He piled on that raw classic sound with the fresh chill sounds of summer.</p><p>I think trying to describe the sound of his set is a bit futile.  I mentioned in a <a href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago" title="/sasha-spybar-chicago">previous post</a> that aside from his darker raw progressive house sound, he has a more Tech House / Indie House kind of sound that he's been spinning at his 'Never say Never' events at Ushuaia Beach Resort in Ibiza.  But at this point his Tech House / Indie House vibe has completely taken over, but with his signature style underneath.</p><p>Over the last year, he's been in the studio producing some of his own music.  He's released a few tracks on his Last Night of Earth record label, as well as working on the third installment of his Involver CD series, which he's been somewhat secretive about.</p><p>He started 'Never say Never' because he felt he wasn't playing tracks from all the artists he loved, and, now, 3 years later, he's made that sound his own.  He's separated himself from the other Progressive House kings, and puts himself alongside Guy Gerber, Benoit &amp; Sergio, and all the other DJs that spin a more Tech House vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp"  /></p><p>His set from Wavefront was the perfect soundtrack to a warm summer day.

After going to North Coast and Spring Awakening, it was amazing going to a festival where I was completely in tune with the music.

Both festivals are geared towards the new generation of electronica fans, and the music I care about gets shoved in whatever time slots remain.</p><p>I really hope SpyBar achieved the success they hoped for with Wavefront, and I hope they make this a yearly event.

| July 4, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The summer of music festivals continued this last weekend with the Wavefront Music Festival.  Wavefront was hosted by Spy Bar on Chicago's Montrose Beach, slightly north of the downtown area.  The purpose of Wavefront was to bring together the old crowd of electronic music lovers, with the new crowd.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp"  /></p><p>For the past couple of years, React has grown and grown and become the leader in electronic entertainment in Chicago, and the type of talent they've brought to Chicago has been mostly mainstream.</p><p>I complained about this a little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">Spring Awakening</a> post, but as dubstep, electro house, and other certain genres have become quite mainstream, the other genres are starting to become second class citizens.  At first, there was room for everyone, and all of electronic dance music seemed to flourish, but these days it seems like those genres are getting choked out by the popular crap.</p><p>I think the fans of true dance music are starting to notice, and fight back a little bit.  There was an article a couple weeks ago, railing on the popular DJs today, enforcing that they don't even play DJ sets.  They basically just play rock concerts.  They play the same set from front to back without little variation at all.  They don't play to the crowd.</p><p>And that's exactly what the kids these days want.  They go to these major events to hear their favorite tunes, rather than hear something new or reactive to the vibe.  That's why so many of these DJs are playing the same songs from the last 3 or 4 years, and why they play so many pandering dubstep remixes.  The crowds at these concerts <b>only seem to care about the content of the song</b>, rather than the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Wavefront had two stages, the North stage and the South stage.  The South stage had plenty of electro house, dubstep, and other popular crap.  They had such acts as Bad Boy Bill, MSTRKRFT, Erick Morillo, Chris Lake, John Dahlback, Eric Prydz, and Duck Sauce.</p><p>The North Stage had me sold on Day 1, though.  They had Visionquest, Art Department, Matthew Dear, Benoit &amp; Sergio, Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, and <b>Sasha</b>.  All groovy mellow house, whether it be Progressive House, Deep House, or Tech House.</p><div class='title'><b>Day 1 - Saturday</b></div><p>Five and I both purchased weekend passes for this event, and went down to Chicago on Saturday afternoon.  We got to the beach around 3 o'clock, right in the middle of <b>Visionquest's</b> set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp"  /></p><p>Visionquest played a very nice mellow opener set for the day.  It wasn't outrageous or over top.  It was the perfect start for the day.  And the perfect set up for <b>Art Department</b>.</p><p>Art Department played an amazing bass heavy deep house set.  I recognized a couple of tunes from some of their previous sets, and ones from Sasha, too.  This was how I knew I was home at this festival.  The crowd responded and grooved along with the set, and Art Department kept pumping in the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The sound from the North Stage was incredible.  In that above photo, you can see piles of subwoofers in front of the stage.  You could move almost anywhere on the beach, and still hear the music with perfect clarity.</p><p>And most of the crowd was pretty well spread out too, so you could move around without bumping into people.  There were people in the back, laying on their towels, catching some sun.  Other people sitting in some plastic chairs, relaxing to the wonderful music.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>As Art Department finished up their kickin' groovy set, <b>Matthew Dear</b> hopped up on the stage and starting setting up for his act.

He brought the vibe down a little bit from the heights Art Department brought it to, but Matthew kept it going.</p><p>Five and I started wandering around a little bit to see what else was going on.  We walked over to the local stage and listened to <b>Gene Farris</b> for a little while.  And he was playing a pretty energetic Housey set.

But it really wasn't my thing.

It seems like whatever substance he may have had back in the day is long gone now.</p><p>Five and I continued to walk around the festival grounds.

These guys are one of the few electro groups that I haven't written off yet.  Underneath their occasional obnoxious sounds, they still carry a beat.  It's still Dance music.  Most popular tracks these days, and Dubstep especially really isn't dance music as much as it is "rock-out" music.  You can't dance to it.  You throw your fists and arms in the air, and rock out, or rage out to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, MSTRKRFT's set didn't really evolve over time.  When they transitioned from track to track, it felt more like they were simply changing it up, rather than building on whatever vibe they had set.  So, after awhile, it really didn't carry as much weight.  It went back to the mentality of having a set list, rather than a vibe.

So, Five and I took off for the day.  We drove north a little bit and went to a small pizza place with a whole lot of comfortable seating.  It was a pretty fine day, and we still had the rest of the night to look forward to.</p><p>Wavefront had plenty of after parties to choose from, but the one I was most interested in was the one at Smart Bar.</p><div class='title'><b>Visionquest + Art Department @ Smart Bar</b></div><p>Art Department blew me away earlier in the day, and I definitely wanted to hear more of them.  Five and I arrived at the club around 11pm, and it was already pretty packed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2612.webp"  /></p><p>In the booth, the members of Visionquest were taking turns spinning their house beats.  It was a mix of Deep House, and regular 'ol House.  And much like their set during the Wavefront Festival, they kept a lid on the vibe.  They never went over the top, or blew me away, but kept that perfect tempo that continued to tease me.  It really felt like they were holding back, but that was par for the course as they were opening up the night for Art Department later on.</p><p>Visionquest is a 4 man group, and it seemed like each member was given an hour (or so) to spin the set they wanted.  When we arrived <b>Ryan Crosson</b> was on the decks.  Around 12:30 or 1 o'clock, <b>Lee Curtiss</b> took over the controls for the better part of the evening.  Lee played a fantastic set, but again, it still felt like an opening set.</p><p>As 2am rolled around, I was starting to feel the wear of the night.  Lee's set wasn't energizing me enough to keep moving, and I was really only waiting for Art Department to take over and blow me away.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2605.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2616.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2631.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2631.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2631.webp"  /></p><p>Around 2:30, <b>Shaun Reeves</b> set up and began spinning some of his tracks, and that was pretty much it for me.  When was Art Department planning on showing up?  It's approaching 3am, and they still aren't here?  Were they only going to spin for an hour?</p><p>Bleh, I was falling asleep, and needed to find a bed.  It was a long day.  So we left, and ended our first day of Wavefront.</p><p><b>Overall</b>, Art Department was pretty damn fine.  Matthew Dear and Visionquest weren't half bad either.  But a lot of the other scheduled talent fell pretty flat for me.
