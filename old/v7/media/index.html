The Kanji for this is <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>四君子</span></span>, which reads <i>shikunshi</i> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>しくんし</span></span> in Japanese. Gentlemen, in this context, refers to an individual that exhibits virtues and morality that all people should aspire to. Each of the flowers represents different virtues stemming from their season.</p><p>In Lego release order, the Chrysanthemum <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>菊</span></span> represents fall. Despite the cooler weather, the flower blooms with bright energetic warm colors. It's generally considered a loner as its virtue is to share joy and shine proudly as yourself withstanding all adversities. It also symbolizes longevity.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Winter is represented by the Plum Blossom <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>梅</span></span>. Its petals bloom a sharp crimson contrasting the coldest whitest months of the year. Though, not the most beautiful flower, it continues the bloom its best in a time of the year when most other flowers can't survive. As such, the Plum represents inner beauty and humbleness.</p><p>Leading into the new year, the Orchid <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>蘭</span></span> represents Spring. The orchid is a fragile flower, soft in a form and fragrance. It is often referred to as the most inoffensive flower.

The repetitious parts will only take about 5 minutes max. All sets have uncommon building techniques and parts usage that you probably hadn't thought of before. For example, the bulb of Chrysanthemum is created using over 30 lego bananas in different shades of yellow and orange. The flowers of the Mini Orchid use 3 handheld shield pieces, an interesting reference back to the Full Orchid, which uses 3 full-body shield pieces in its flowers.</p><p>Each are fun builds, look great, and are super cheap at only $30 each.</p><p>If you were going to buy only one set out of them all, it's hard to recommend just one. My favorites are the Bamboo and the Chrysanthemum. Both of these sets look amazing at both a distance and up close. Originally, I skipped the Chrysanthemum because I thought the orange would outshine the others. It does quickly draw the eye, but the subtle perfection of the Bamboo can hold your eye just as long. Even though both are striking, I think they stay in their own lane as part of an ensemble. I think the Mini Orchid is the weakest. The bulbs on the full Orchid look more like flowers and less like Lego than the Mini-version.</p><p>All of them together create a very nice ensemble. There's still room on that shelf for more flowers, so I'm looking forward to the next Botanical sets Lego plans on releasing this year, and beyond.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Arrival &amp; Language" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/arrival-and-language">Arrival &amp; Language</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 3, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Nearly two years ago, Ghibli Park was first opened in the Aichi Commemorative Expo Park, northeast of Nagoya. Ghibli Park is an open-air museum of sorts, with replica houses, buildings, and environments from various works by Ghibli Film. In the center of it all, is the Ghibli Warehouse, which houses a museum, other exhibits, a theater, shops, and several other recreations of Ghibli works and history.</p><p>There are four open-air areas of the Ghibli Park, each require an advanced ticket to enter. Each area is spread around the Expo Park. Here's a map:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp"></a></p><p>In addition to the <span class="orange"><b>Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></span></b></span> in the middle, the <span class="light_blue"><b>Hill of Youth <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></span></b></span> is near one of the main parking lots and the train station in the north. It's most likely the first area you'll come across. Near the other parking lot and to the south is <span class="olive"><b>Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>どんどの森</span></span></b></span>. These were the first areas available when Ghibli Park first opened on November 1st, 2022. Since then, in November 2023, the <span class="purple"><b>Mononoke Village <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>もののけの里</span></span></b></span> in the northeast was completed. And most centralized and most recently opened in March 2024 is the <span class="magenta"><b>Valley of Witches <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></span></b></span>.</p><p>One of my friends visited the park a year or more ago, and said it wasn't all that special, but this is absolutely not the case. Seeing the scale of these areas in person is incredible. Climbing to the scenic lookout point, prior to the park's opening, and peering down at a life-size replica of Howl's Moving Castle brought up feelings that I didn't know I had.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" /></a></p><p>DAMN. That's it. That's fricken it! The madmen did it!</p><div class='title'><b>Tickets</b></div><p>Tickets for the Ghibli Park are all purchased in advance, online through Lawson. There are 4 different types of tickets available, with different levels of access to the park. The main tickets are purchases 2 months in advance, but there are last-minute tickets you can buy within 7 days prior to visit.</p><p>The standard ticket is the Grand Sanpo Pass, or Grand Walking Pass. This pass allows entrance to all four outdoor areas of Ghibli Park, and gives a specific entrance time to the Ghibli Warehouse. When you buy the ticket, the time you're choosing is when you can enter the Warehouse. You can enter any of the outside areas at anytime throughout the day. Tickets are 3500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p>The second ticket is the Grand Sanpo Premium Pass. This also has a specific time for the Warehouse and allows entrance to all four outdoor areas. The Premium part allows entrance to specific buildings inside of the areas, including Mei & Satsuki's Home, the Earth Antique Store, Okino's Residence, the Witch's Home, and Howl's Moving Castle. Without a premium pass, you cannot enter these buildings. This ticket is 7300<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p>There's a third ticket which only includes access to Mononoke Village, The Valley of Witches, and all buildings in the Valley of Witches. Because these two areas are recent additions to the Ghibli Park, they created a new ticket just for people who had visited in the first year. This ticket is 3300<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>, and I think it will only be available temporarily for a little while longer.</p><p>The final type of ticket is the last-minute Sanpo Pass. This ticket can only be purchased 7 days before your arrival, and it only includes the 4 outdoor areas of the park. There's no access to buildings, and no access to the Ghibli Warehouse. Also, you only have 3 hours to use your tickets to enter the areas. This ticket is only 1500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p>I purchased the 3500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> Grand Sanpo Pass for November 1st, the 2-year anniversary of the park's opening. The Premium Pass sold out too quickly for me to buy, but there seemed like a lot to do already. There were so many places to go and see. I wanted this trip to be more of a dry run rather than an exhaustive one. My warehouse entry time was Noon.</p><div class='title'><b>Open and Opening</b></div><p>Despite Ghibli Park's website clearly stating that there is absolutely no parking, there was plenty of parking. I think they state this based on a technicality that Ghibli Park itself has no dedicated parking, but the Expo Park has plenty. </p><p>While Ghibli Park is the main draw (and often only draw) for the Expo Park, Ghibli Park still treats itself part of the area, rather than the whole thing. As such, the park is almost completely open. I arrived at around 8:30am, well before the 10am opening time. I was planning on sitting in my car, and going through photos. But, so many people were walking in after they parked.</p><p>Unlike a typical theme park or museum, there is no gate, and no perimeter closing the park off to people who didn't have tickets.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The bell tower elevator was completely open.

It's like an expanded version of the <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-museum" title="/ghibli-museum" title="/ghibli-museum">Ghibli Museum</a> near Tokyo. You get a ticket to watch an exclusive Ghibli Film. There are areas showcasing the creativity and history of Ghibli. And, much like the rest of the park, tons of areas that replicate scenes and characters from Ghibli Film's library of works.</p><p>There is so much here. I'm going to make a separate post about it. You can look at the <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse">photos</a> now, though, if you'd like.</p><p>Ultimately, I stayed in the warehouse for over 2 hours. 20 minutes of that was waiting in line at the gift shop.

Maybe an oversight on my part, but I did not eat anything in the park, at all. I had a pizza in my car from visiting Costco the day before, so I already had more food than I needed. I'll do more of a food journey on my next trip.</p><p>The road leading into the main area slowly reveals more and more buildings of the town. The first building is The Witch's Home, from Earwig and the Witch. This is the home where Bella Yaga and Mandarake live, and bring Earwig after they adopt her. This home is part of the premium pass, so I could not enter.</p><p>The road continues passed a fountain and some more buildings. There's a building with a confusing layout that is inspired by a boy who dreams of flying, like the puzzles in Laputa or Kiki. I didn't really notice any strong references. </p><p>Next to this building is the valley's Clock Tower. The Clock Tower sits at the edge of ruins from a possibly city, leading to Howl's Moving Castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Howl's Moving Castle was magnificent.

This is where she lived before leaving on her journey and training to become a witch in the city of Koriko. Looking at photos online, there are beautiful rooms, like her mother's potion laboratory, the witch's shop, kitchen, and bedrooms.</p><p>Going back into the main town is the Guuchoki Bakery where Kiki lived with the Osono family. Connected to the bakery, is the Hatter's Hat Shop (from Howl), which sells hats and candy, the Witch's Bookshelf on the second floor, with various books about magic, and Sophie's workshop also on the second floor. </p><p>Nearby is a Hot Dog stand selling hot dogs with buns that look like cat's paws. They also sell beer, apparently. (Man, I need to back). On the way out of the Valley Witches is the main gift store, Thirteen Witches.

In order to get my final button, I had to ask one of attendants and she escorted me inside to the store to quickly buy it.</p><p>The other building of the Hill of Youth is the Cat Office from The Cat Returns, the spin-off film to Whisper of the Heart.

This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.</p><p>In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.</p><p>As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack? Did he give the command to invade?</p><p>This is the overall plot of the 2012 film, Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as Bonner Fellers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp"/></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>General Bonner Fellers</b></div><p>The film focuses on Bonner Fellers.

Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. </p><p>This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time.

The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. <b>Honne</b> is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.</p><p>This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.</p><p>That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.</p><p>Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"</p><div class='title'><b>Group Harmony formed from Ancient History</b></div><p>I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. </p><p>Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.</p><p>As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.</p><p>Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. </p><p>In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.</p><div class='title'><b>Direct and Indirect Language</b></div><p>You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.</p><p>In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.</code></p><p>We always want to know <code>who</code> is doing <code>what</code> when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.</p><p>Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.</p><p><code><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>私は</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>毎日</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>学校に</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>歩いて行きます。</span></span></code></p><p>You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.</p><p>Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>すみません、ちょっと。。</span></span>" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.</p><p>The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.</p><p>Anyways... back to Emperor.</p><div class='title'><b>Dai-Ichi Life Building <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>第一生命</span></span></b></div><p>As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds.

should've studied more, but I was able to get a photo of that tree. That same tree shows up in the same location behind Fellers (Matthew Fox), although the depth of field is pulled WAY in.</p><p>In reality, I couldn't find any information that said Fellers actually entered the Palace grounds for an interview. Also, would it have been appropriate to have entered through this gate?

Crossing through it is part of ceremony. The other two northern gates are for workers and guests. But, this was 80 years ago, post-war, and technically he had official approval from MacArthur making Fellers and extension of MacArthur whom the Japanese government viewed as the highest order.</p><div class='title'><b>Accuracy v. Story Telling</b></div><p>Overall, Emperor takes a lot of liberties with history in order to tell its story. Some of the smaller ones have been covered already, but the biggest inaccuracy is the love story between Fellers and Shimada Aya. Their story is completely fictional as Fellers was already married to Dorothy Dysart in 1925. They stayed married with 3 children until Feller's death in 1973.</p><p>The overall love story was most likely added to make the story relatable to general audience. Do people really want another boring historical drama based on facts? If Fellers has "love" for Japan, we gotta show that love somehow. Love for a woman is the easiest way to do this. Plus, people like a good tragic love story. Let's do that.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Critics hated this part of the story because it was so cliche. They also felt that the film focused on their love story too much when they had a wealth of history to draw story from.</p><p>But, for someone that knows nothing of the subject matter, I think the movie does well portraying the events in the film and introducing the audience to these events that were pivotal in created modern Japan. It also does well introducing people to some parts of Japanese culture they probably aren't familiar with. So many war movies focus on heroes in battle and show the horror of war. Very very few films focus on creating peace through reconciliation rather than fighting.</p><p>Emperor is a fantastic under appreciated film.</p><div class='title'><b>Imperial Palace <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>皇居</span></span></b></div><p>After showing the palace guards MacArthur's approval, Fellers enters the Palace and interviews Sekiya. Through researching these locations, I noticed that the Imperial Palace offered tours. Unfortunately, these tours are only outside the palace buildings. But, they're still within the palace grounds.</p><p>You could make reservations, but the majority of people just show up. They allow the first 300 people who show up an hour before the tour to join.

Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it.

Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.</p><p>It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Tour</b></div><p>Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.</p><p>The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.</p><p>I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lights Out" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lights-out">Lights Out</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Students always have fun watching horror films, and while Lights Out isn't the best movie, the jump scares keep students interested while the back story is slowly revealed and explained. Dialogue is sometimes difficult to understand, but it's very native and expressively acted.</p><p>Please read <a href="/old/v7/lights-out" title="/lights-out" title="/lights-out">this description post</a> for more detailed information about the film, class ideas, and how the film is used for class.</p><p>This class is only taught once a week. There are periods of listening to dialogue and identifying missing words in the script. This is followed by going over the meaning, if it's necessary. Listening classes lead to performance tests, which are a pair students acting a scene from the film.</p><table>    <tr>        <th class="ex1"></th>        <th class="ex2">Contents</th>        <th class="ex3">Time Code</th>        <th class="ex4">Materials</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="top title">01</td>        <td class="top"><b>Movie Introduction</b> -- A man is killed in a warehouse</td>        <td class="top">0050 - 0435</td>        <td class="top">            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBqFRYsrdOhvKyP9Xb8jGYbOhOgFwzDA/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBqFRYsrdOhvKyP9Xb8jGYbOhOgFwzDA/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBqFRYsrdOhvKyP9Xb8jGYbOhOgFwzDA/view?usp=drive_link">                Listening</a>        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="title">02</td>        <td><b>Main Characters</b> -- We meet Becca and Bret at Becca's apartment.</td>        <td>0511 - 0664</td>        <td>            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dIVu0PbR42BRTVQc6Wc6zX8c-PUI3g6M/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dIVu0PbR42BRTVQc6Wc6zX8c-PUI3g6M/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dIVu0PbR42BRTVQc6Wc6zX8c-PUI3g6M/view?usp=drive_link">                Listening</a>        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="title">03</td>        <td><b>House, School</b> -- Martin sees the Monster / Becca talks with Emma.</td>        <td>0642 - 1001</td>        <td>            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d9QZZ_ffRfk8kuQg2kLJ2qR3TFtUj03a/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d9QZZ_ffRfk8kuQg2kLJ2qR3TFtUj03a/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d9QZZ_ffRfk8kuQg2kLJ2qR3TFtUj03a/view?usp=drive_link">                Listening</a>        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="title">04</td>        <td><b>At the House</b> -- Becca Bret and Martin return to Mom's House.</td>        <td>1004 - 1145</td>        <td>            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5YEvj5SzAOpC4YFxVr-KxO9Bt2AcPk_/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5YEvj5SzAOpC4YFxVr-KxO9Bt2AcPk_/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5YEvj5SzAOpC4YFxVr-KxO9Bt2AcPk_/view?usp=drive_link">                Listening</a>        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="title">05</td>        <td><b>House, Apartment</b> -- Becca and Mom argue.

For listening classes, we'll run through the dialogue again and again so students have a chance to listen many times. After listening is complete, we'll quickly go through the meaning of the dialogue if it's necessary. Some classes, like 12, focus only on the dialogue's meaning.</p><div class='title'><b>Performance Tests</b></div><p>Each section of the class leads to a performance test. Performance Tests are performed by two students creating a pair. In pairs, students will decide who portray which character. They'll practice pronunciation, memorization, but they'll also practice showing correct emotions and expressions when speaking the dialogue.</p><p>Performance Tests are graded with the following criteria under the following categories.</p><table class="grades">    <tr>        <th>Correctness</th>        <th>Expression</th>        <th>Cooperation</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <td>            <b>Pronunciation</b><br/>            Saying the words with the correct pronunciation.        </td>        <td>            <b>Memorized</b><br/>            Remember your lines.

And, 2 for doing it well.</p><p>Speaking the dialogue correctly is important, but the goal of the exercise is to correctly <b>express</b> the dialogue together with your partner. Acting isn't something you do by yourself. The scene is a combination of the two actors together, supporting and working off of each other. So, in grading, this is also considered.</p><p>The expressions for the first performance test are pretty easy, but the second test has deeper emotions that carry that overall meaning of the scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Grades</b></div><p>The overall grades for the class are created from 20% participation and 80% test scores.</p><p>The participation grade comes from completing the listening assignments in class and turning them in. If you miss class, it's up to you to complete them on your own. Test scores are created from the above criteria.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Orchid" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-orchid">Lego Orchid</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

You can see the difference in the right photo below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I don't know why this is different, but you really can't tell in the finished design and it works the same way.

The Garden trees have a total of 17. In total, 57 leaves across the three sets. Each Bonsai leaf had 5 frogs, for a total of 200 pink frogs across both sets. That means each leaf should have 3.5 frogs. Each Garden leaf had 4 small flowers, for a total of 58 flower pieces. Easy.

From a distance, you could barely tell the flowers or trees were Lego. With its huge success, Lego continued to release more botanical sets.</p><p>Going into this summer, they announced their new sets, one of which was the Lego Tranquil Garden.

At a distance, both figures kind of blend into the model.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6449_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6458_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230812_lego_garden/IMG_6482_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I loved how this set turned out, and it looks great next to the Bonsai tree.

Many fans of both Lego and Playstation praised the set for how authentic it looked to the game source. Modern Lego designers love to use Lego's vast library of pieces and colors in unique ways to create something that looks less and less like Lego each time.</p><p>Recently I had built the Lego Bonsai tree, and absolutely loved it. I'm not really a fan of Lego's aesthetic and blocky models, and both the Bonsai Tree and the Horizon Tallneck sets, as well as many other modern sets, try to hide these features as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Tallneck has so many rounded edges, curved surfaces, and off-angled lines that it looks more like a regular plastic model, rather than a Lego model. Even the joints for each leg have incredible articulation, like an action figure.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp"></a></p><p>Even though the set retails for $100, I was able to get a "used" set from Yahoo Auctions for $40. Used means that the set was already opened and built. They were selling it already built, too. But for that price, I could easily disassemble it and build it up again as if it were the first time.</p><p>The package was pristine when I received it in the mail and it included almost all of the original empty bags that hold the pieces. It was really easy to take apart and organize into its newly opened state.</p><p>Then, on May 13th, I streamed myself building it.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RckDOp3RbAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>It was fun putting it together, but I didn't really have the same energy that I had with the Bonsai Tree. Maybe it was because I had already seen it completed, so there weren't any surprises.  But, I don't really like the overall look in person. I feel like it still retains some of that block Lego aesthetic even though they try to hide it as much as possible. It's also really big.</p><p>Originally, I was planning on modifying the base to add the Bonsai tree to it, but the Tallneck completely towers over the tree. They don't really compliment each other after all.</p><p>I had it on my shelf for about a month, but I decided to take it down and take it apart again. You can see this progress in the photos below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The whole process is kind of like taking apart a puzzle after you build it.

This was one of two initial sets in the Botanical Collection, a series of Lego sets meant to show the vibrance and beauty of plant life. One of the goals of Lego has always been to replicate the real world within the constrictions of using Lego bricks. It originally did this as a child's toy, but has expanded year after to include sets specifically designed for adults. Modern adult Lego sets can feel a lot more like building a model, but with the ease and satisfaction of Lego bricks connecting together.</p><p>It has been a few years since it was released, but I finally decided to buy it. It retails for $50 in the US, or 6000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> over here. I also bought a lighting kit for $30.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1933_t.webp" /></p><p>The Bonsai Tree is meant to embody both the beauty and simplicity of an actual bonsai tree. Also, it's meant to give you the creative freedom to mold and modify the tree however you like. Much like how you cut and mold the branches of a real bonsai tree, you can do the same with the Lego tree.</p><p>To get you started, the Bonsai Tree set comes with two options. Once you build the trunk of the tree and the branches, you can add on green leaves. This would make it look like a normal bonsai tree. Or, you could add white leaves and pink flowers to make the bonsai tree look like a cherry blossom tree.</p><p>One of the reasons that I wanted to buy this set was seeing the cherry blossom version of the tree online. So, I had to go that route.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1948_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1949_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Putting together the tree was so satisfying. It's really fascinating how far Lego sets have come over the last 40 years. People who work at Lego have grown up with Lego their whole life. They creatively use regular and unique pieces in different ways to create something that you wouldn't have noticed before.</p><p>It would've been so easy for them to make the tree go straight up from the ground, but the base of the tree uses hinges to angle it. Curved pieces are used to make the base of the trunk fatter and hide those hinges. Different colors of brown are used to make the tree look more dynamic and real. Tube pieces are used as main branches. Even both options of green leaves or pink flowers have different pieces and techniques to make the tree look different, and more like the actual tree they're trying to emulate.</p><p>Something that modern Lego LOVES to do is is hide all of their signature studs with smooth bricks. It turns the overall piece into something more like a model. Overall, it creates a very striking piece for your shelf.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1955_t.webp" /></p><p>Before building the set, I looked online for ways on how people were modding their trees. Lots of people had very dynamic changes with colors and leaves. The booklet had some interesting ideas, too.

Many other kits had LED lights stickers that you put on to the pieces, which I think completely goes against the spirit of Lego. You should always be able to take apart and modify an existing Lego set, and always be able to reuse pieces.</p><p>Several people online mentioned about how difficult these instructions were to follow, and they were absolutely correct. There are 3 strings of pinks lights meant to be put into the tree, but it's not clear which one is supposed to be used in which branch. In the end, I just ignored the instructions and put them up where they seemed appropriate. </p><p>This caused a mess of wires at the end. I assume all of those wires should have been the same length.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1964_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230416_lego/IMG_1966_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>But, besides the instructions, this kit is really nice.

If I bought a second tree, I could use all of those pieces to make it higher. Also, if I bought a few different pieces, I could make the foliage on the branches a little different on the lower level. If I add a second level to the tree, maybe I could buy a second pair of lights for the high part.</p><p>Unfortunately Lego is very expensive, so it's hard for me to justify buying all this stuff for something that will just sit on my shelf. Lego is definitely fun to build, but if I'm going to spend the money on a second tree and second lights, that's nearly $90 that could go to something else.</p><p>But I dunno. Maybe it's fine to put some money into one set of Legos every 10 years.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (25)
