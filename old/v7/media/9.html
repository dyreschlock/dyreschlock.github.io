| August 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I'm sure I've seen Lost in Translation before today.  Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v7/home" title="/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Trainspotting" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/trainspotting">Trainspotting</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Throughout my life, I can count a number of cultural keystones that have dramatically shaped my tastes and perceptions.  Keystones in the form of music, movies, television, video games and combinations of these forms of entertainment.</p><p>Around 1995 was when I finally heard that pulsing electronic sound that has been with me every since.  I heard it on television from MTV's Amp.  I heard it from video games in Wipeout XL.  I heard it in the movies from Hackers.  Drowning in a raging auditory ocean of Rock, Pop, Country, Oldies, this distant dynamic sound was so completely different.  Once I heard these tracks and that sound, I knew I had found music that was for me.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple years later that I discovered Sasha and other DJs that really opened my eyes and ears to the Electronic Music genre as a whole.  But for a time, I had a couple songs that were my own.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Had I seen <b>Trainspotting</b> back in my youth, it probably would've been sitting alongside those I mentioned earlier.  Trainspotting is very rich in music, character, life, satire..  There's some amazing camera shots, and scene transitions..  This movie has it all.</p><p>10 years ago, I would've watched this movie again and again, dissected every scene, put meaning to the randomness, placed myself in character's shoes..  But today, I'm just along for the ride.  Trainspotting oozes with Youth, especially seeing a young Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller, and Kelly MacDonald run around in their low to mid 20s.</p><p>The music and the faces bring me back 10 years to the mid-ish 90s.  Young and ripe.  It's the same feeling I get whenever I pop in Hackers or listen to Atom Bomb, Papua New Guinea, Cowgirl, Halcyon.. (by Fluke, Future Sound of London, Underworld, Orbital).</p><p>I'm not sure if anyone else's brain works this way, but a specific melody or tune can bring back the most vibrant memories of my past than words or stories.  Whenever I hear Atom Bomb, I'm instantly transported back to my room at age 16ish watching Amp on MTV's around 2 in the morning.  Whenever I hear the Facility background music from Goldeneye 007, I'm instantly transported to Justin's Mom's house in Wayzata playing N64 with him around 11pm after working at Toys R Us for the night.</p><p>I guess the same works with images too, but it's not as powerful as hearing.  It's a powerful touchstone at a singular point in my life that can always be revived by that distinctive sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Anyways, I'm sure I would've loved this movie If I saw it back then.  But better late than never, I suppose. ^_^.</p><p>As mentioned before, Ewan McGregor is the main star of this movie, who has gone on to be young Obi-wan Kenobi in the Star Wars Pre-Trilogy.  Kelly MacDonald is in this movie too!  In fact, it's her very first role in a movie.  She's the wife in No Country for Old Men.  Also, Paige Marshall in Choke.</p><p>Also, Trainspotting is directed by Danny Boyle, whom you might know as the director of Slumdog Millionaire.  He also directed 28 Days Later.</p><p>It's also interesting that almost all the actors in Trainspotting are actually scottish, except for Johnny Lee Miller.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xtro" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xtro">Xtro</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>About a week ago, I saw one of the cheesiest, most bizarre movies I've ever seen, Xtro.  I have no idea how I came across this title.  Nor do I know how it became to exist in my Netflix queue.  But, I'm quite glad that I had the pleasure of viewing this treasure.</p><p>Xtro is ultimately about a boy.  Little Tony is scarred at a young age by the disappearance of his father, Sam.  They were out for an ordinary game of catch, when POOF!  Aliens appear from beyond the mountains and abduct Sam.  Alone, Tony grieves for his loss.  Returning home, no one believes him.  Those who don't know the truth believe that Sam had run away from his responsibilities as a father.  The aliens couldn't have picked a worse time to intervene as things hadn't really been going well at home.</p><p>3 years later, things have actually turned out better for everyone except Tony.  His mother is now with a cool hunky photographer.  They live in downtown London where all the magic happens.  Tony has a super hot babysitter who gets naked several times throughout the film.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tony has recurring nightmares of his father's abduction.  He wakes throughout the night from his own screams and whimpers.  Alas, his mother still does not believe him.  "Quite whining and shut up about that ridiculous lie.  He left us!"  She would say as she burst into his room, afterward returning to her bed with her super-fly boyfriend.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the forests outside of London the aliens return!  They appear above the trees and deposit an odd creature.  An infantile organism that begins to adapt and move across the forest bed...  it finds the smooth pavement of a nearby road, and then suddenly finds the bumper of an oncoming car.  Shocked by ramming such a weird looking animal, the automobile stops and its occupants search for the wounded being.  Of course, the alien finds them first.</p><p>Meanwhile, later, the alien finds itself upon a cabin in the woods with a lone female occupant.  You may guess what might happen next.  Bow-chicka-wow-wow...  The alien impregnates the woman and runs off.  Never to be seen in the film again.  Startled by such an event, the young woman is dazed but then feels the fetus inside her.</p><p>The fetus rapidly grows and...  here's a clip of what happens next as she gives birth...  [find it on youtube]</p><p>It's Sam!  Sam is back from outer space and ready to relive his life as Tony's father.  Of course he doesn't actually remember being abducted.</p><p>As you might expect, drama occurs, then murder, then boobs, then it gets weird.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>Ultimately, Sam's purpose for return was to retrieve Tony.  But in order for Tony to adapt to space travel, he must under go a transformation process.  Sam bestows the power to overcome adaption to space.  As the power matures inside of Tony, he gains the power to materialize his hallucinations. But ultimately, he's taken over by the power's control.</p><p>Tony's first order of business is to create a friend.  The friend that he's always wanted!  A creepy clown midget will do.  Next!  Kill all my annoying neighbors with life sized versions of my toys.  Kill my asshole step dad.  Kill that asshole elderly woman, downstairs.  Kill the hot naked babysitter for some reason.  Actually, wait a minute.  Don't kill her.  Knock her out.  Mutate her womb.  And then collect the alien eggs she produces.  Next!  Tip over the refrigerator.  Fill it with Guacamole.  And use it as an incubator for more aliens.  The perfect plan!</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam lures Mom back to the forest.  Tony appears.  And off they go to Never Never Land.  Leaving the mom a wake of bodies and loneliness on earth.</p><p>The end.</p><div class='title'><b>Bold!</b></div><p>I wish the Science Fiction movies of today had the bizarre spin of movies from the late 70s, early 80s.  Has there been a horror movie in the past 5 or 10 years that has made you cringe and yell out, "Oh my god?!"  I think Hostel has really been the only one I can think of.  And maybe Event Horizon to an extent.</p><p>Why aren't movies this bold anymore?</p><p>Actually, now that I think of it...  Asian torture films as of late have been quite brutal.  Audition was one of the most difficult films to stomach (so to speak).  That film is painful.  Maybe I should watch more of those...</p><div class='title'><b>Moog!</b></div><p>Besides the unbridled gore, wacky retro outfits and attitudes, Xtro has an amazing soundtrack.  In fitting with the late 70s, early 80s, the score is entirely composed with a Moog Synthesizer.  The Moog synth is vital in setting the tone of the movie consistent with the era in which is was produced.  A very organic sound with an outright alien tynch.  Atmospheric tone standing on the brink of technology.</p><p>Xtro is bizarre enough for me to love to begin with, but the beautiful crafted soundtrack keeps me locked in with the experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The end...?</b></div><p>The ending of the <b>Xtro</b> is left open.  There are some alternate endings on the DVD, but ultimately the alien eggs hatch and you're left to figure out what happens next.</p><p>There are two sequels following Xtro, but have absolutely nothing to do with the original movie, nor each other.  Both sequels feature military teams combating an alien menace.  Xtro 2 (released in 1990) is an Alien ripoff, and Xtro 3 (released in 1995) is a Predator ripoff.  Both films are god awful.  Neither has nudity.  Neither has grotesque horror.</p><p>Everything unique about Xtro 1 was completely generic in its sequels.  The story.  The characters.  The setting.  The action.  The circumstances.  The music.</p><p>Xtro 1 was pretty low budget, but they made up for it with imagery you'd never see anywhere else.  Xtro 2 and 3 are wannabe copies of blockbuster films that try to bring the franchise back into reality.  They are not bold, nor eye catching.  They are sad imitations that I regret ever watching.</p><p>Anyways, definitely check out <b>Xtro</b> on Netflix, but forget about the sequels.</p><p>Also, I swiped that Clip from <a href="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/" title="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/" title="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/">Badmovies.org's Review of Xtro</a>.

Summerfest is an annual music festival held in the established Summerfest Grounds near downtown Milwaukee. For weeks each year, popular bands fill in the lineup to create a massive series of concerts. Standard entry to grounds gives access to everything except the main stage, which requires separate tickets.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4118.webp" /></a></p><p>This year, my friends really wanted to see the <b>Dropkick Murphys</b>, a band that I had only heard of thanks Shipping up to Boston, the song featured prominently in The Departed, a few years prior. They played that song as well as many other highly energetic songs with a gaelic/Irish flourish.</p><p>Before leaving, we wanted to check out <b>Offspring</b>, too, who performed another highly energetic set. Once again, I only knew a few of their songs, thanks to Crazy Taxi. As soon as they opening riff hit from All I Want "Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah," the place exploded and I felt in harmony with the crowd.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I wrote about this in another post, but when you have crowds this massive and fully engaged in the music, it creates a feeling of synesthesia. You become part of the crowd and the crowd becomes one. It's obviously such a rush that it is easy linked and often enchanced to other mind altering substances. Also, obviously, this is the rush that people chase when going to concerts, especially of their favorite bands.</p><p>Both Dropkick Murphys and Offspring (proper) are completely outside of my musical wheelhouse, but their songs create a complete overwhelming sense of energy that it's hard not to get caught up in the wave of energy. And then fully ride that wave of energy when they perform a song you are actually in tune with.</p><p>There were plenty of other bands at Summerfest and other concerts I attended with friends where I was out of my element, but could still recognize the waves. I felt weird and awkward to "get into" the music when it was not me. Those moments always made me look forward to my next outing to a club to slip into the music I love.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" /></a></p><p>However, the real awkwardness didn't occur until the next day, when we returned to watch KISS perform on the main stage. To be fair, we weren't standing in the pit for this one. We were sitting on the grass way in the back with the divorced dads. Pretty hard to be part of any synesthesia when the middle school girl in front of you is complaining to her father.</p><p>Seeing KISS live was more of a checkbox on a bucket list at this point, but they still put on a pretty okay of their hits. They were showing their age, though, as their songs didn't quite have the same energy or vocals as the recorded version of their songs from decades earlier.</p><p>Musically, it was great to get out of my element, but it really just pushed me back into the clubs.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Mar 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ladytron, The Faint @ Metro, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago">Ladytron, The Faint @ Metro, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Back in April, I finally got the chance to see one of my favorite electronic bands Live in Concert.  I'm not sure why Ladytron were on tour, but they came through Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>Ladytron has 4 members and originated in Europe (somewhere) in 1999.  They are somewhat hard to place because of some of their lyrics are in English, while others are not.  I always thought it sounded like Russian, but it's not..  It's not German either..  Wikipedia indicates Bulgarian.</p><p>I started listening to them somewhat by chance.  They'd been recommended to me a couple times, but it wasn't until I came across their CD in Exclusive Company (now out of business) that I decided that today was the day!  (Actually, that was only 3 years ago..)  One by one, I picked up each of their CDs and began listening to them more and more.</p><p>In the beginning their songs are pretty girly.  Most of the lyrics were about boys or other emo topics.  One song seems directly inspired by lead singer Helen Marnie's brief career as a fashion model.  "They only want you when you're 17.  When you're 21, you're no fun."</p><p>By 2003, with their release of Softcore Jukebox, I think they grew out of the emo mentality and started branching out with their music.  They tooked some risks and made some fun songs. ^_^</p><p>After that, Witching Hour and Velocifero were a definite return to their iconic electronic pop sound.  They've had some fantastic songs, but I think they rely on that sound a little too much.  I'd love for them to do another release on the lines of Softcore Jukebox.</p><p>One of my friends commented, "It's good to see a band steer away from emo lyrics.  I think most bands tend to start off strong and then go emo."</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron Live</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp"  /></p><p>My copies of 604 (their first album) and Light &amp; Magic (their second album) were actually re-releases that contained Live versions of their most popular songs.  This is the part of the CD I generally skip over because the levels are all weird and you can't hear the flange of the synthesizer pulling together the bass.</p><p>Unfortunately, this "problem" wasn't with the recording...  When Ladytron took the stage, it sounded like their levels were way off.  It sounded very amateur grunge (or whatever) without the omnipresent bass.  After a couple songs, I totally got into the event, but I think that was because I damaged my ears enough that everything blended together.</p><p>They played all of their iconic songs..  Ghosts, Runaway, Sugar, Seventeen, Destroy Everything You Touch, The Way That I Found You..  It was fantastic to actually hear a band live and know all the songs for a change. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp"  /></p><p>Afterwards, they were downstairs in Smartbar spinning records, but I pulled the old man thing and complained about my legs killing me and how all the kids in the venue are stupid.  So we left.</p><p>But before that...</p><div class='title'><b>The Faint</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp"  /></p><p>The Faint were pretty rockin'.  Prior to this engagement, I'd not heard of them.  So I didn't really pay close attention to them when they got up on stage, but throughout their set they won me over.  Not enough to actually buy their music, but enough to enjoy their performance a whole lot.  Their synthesized sounds mixed perfectly with their instrumental sounds. ^_^</p><p>The combination of The Faint and Ladytron made this night fantastic.  It sucks that we wussed out on their DJ sets, though, but oh well.  I'll visit Smartbar one of these days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rebuild of Evangelion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rebuild-of-evangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>For those who don't know, Evangelion is one of, if not THE, most popular Anime series in Japan.  My pal Justin and I started on the ground floor of its popularity in the US back when it was first being released in 1997 and 1998.  It's the series that put American Anime distributor and localizer ADV Films into a shit load of cash.</p><p>It original aired on Japanese TV in 1995 for a total of 26 episodes.  The final two episodes lead to a bit of an outcry by fans at to what the fuck creator Hideaki Anno was thinking.  Budgetary restraints kept the final two episodes very cheap.  Episodes were poorly animated, but kept a pencil drawing type scheme which looked "artsy".</p><p>Despite everyone hating these two episodes, I liked them.  These two episodes got rid of all the other distractions of plot, military, espionage, and other characters, Anno picked the most important aspect of the show and completely focused on it for the ending: Shinji.</p><p>I think most people (especially Americans) hate this because Shinji constantly whines about responsibility, is spineless, and feels he has no worth.  Americans don't give a shit about a coward for a main character.  Especially whens there's explosions and robots everywhere else in the show. The ending shows how Shinji finally over comes all the fears of himself and becomes confident.  "Good job, Shinji!"</p><p>But no.  The fans were outraged!  As such, Hideaki Anno created an alternate ending which replaced those two episodes which kept Shinji spineless and afraid.  And allowed Seele to completely control him and absolutely reset humanity.  Fans didn't know what to think of this ending.  But they got some amazing action sequences, so most of them consider it the better ending.</p><p>Blah blah blah...</p><div class='title'><b>But this is not how it happened!</b></div><p>With two endings to his story, neither of which does a good job of ending the series, Anno has returned.  He's making 4 "all new" movies to tell Evangelion as it was meant to be told.  The <b>Rebuild of Evangelion</b> is a complete re-imagining of the story from start to finish with a completely different ending that satisfies all aspects of the story.  (or so we've been told).</p><p>The first 2 movies will mostly be direct remakes of the original episodes.  Eva 3.0 will begin diverging and take the story to its new ending.  And Eva Final will put an end to everything Evangelion.</p><p>What I've been watching since March is the first movie, entitled...</p><p><b>Evangelion 1.0 You are (not) alone</b> SPOILERS, btw</p><p>This movie remakes episodes 1 through 6 of the original series.  During the episodes Shinji fights 3 Angels ("of death"): Sachiel, Shamshel, and Ramiel.  The plot, themes and whatnot are absolutely identical in both the series and this movie.  One might think that this is the stupidest thing ever.  Especially when the first 18 minutes of the film is almost an exact shot-by-shot update to the original animation.  <b>The genius of the movie is the pacing.</b></p><p>There really is no tension when Shinji fights Sachiel and Shamshel because the scenes are nearly the same as the original and the fans already know what's going to happen.  Sure, it looks prettier but the fights are the same.  Plus, after Shamshel you have that long boring part where Shinji runs away and nothing really happens.</p><p>Then Ramiel appears.  Ramiel is a bit shinier, but still looks the same...  until..</p><p><object width="640" height="505" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p><p>Holy shit.  That's different.  Ramiel is absolutely menacing.  Ramiel is pretty abstract to begin with, but now his attacks show the full force of his destructive power.</p><p>We still know what happens, but the Ramiel fight takes center stage.  I immediately shot awake and continued watching with my eyes glued to the screen.  Ramiel is far more dangerous than I remember him...  maybe in Evangelion 1.0, Ramiel actually does win.  How the hell are they going to stop this thing?</p><p>Unlike the series where this is just another episode, the movie builds up to this point and flourishes.  Shinji's own confidence builds to this point as well.  He's beginning to think about why he should pilot Evangelion, rather than doing what he's told.  Both plot lines balance in harmony as Shinji fires upon Ramiel to prove his worth.</p><p>With the ending of Evangelion 1.0, Hideaki Anno proves that both plots with Shinji and Evangelion can co-exist and satisfies both camps who prefer either ending of the original.</p><p>Stay tuned in November for the American release!</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 2.0 You can (not) advance</b></div><p>Let the speculation begin.  Eva 2.0 is released in Japanese theaters on Sat June 27th.  Shots from the trailer feature Angels all the way up to Zeruel, the 14th Angel.  As such, apparently this movie will cover episodes 7 all the way through 19, which is TWICE the amount as the first movie.  That's a shit load of ground to cover.  Especially when these episodes feature FAR more story than anything that went on in the first 6 episodes.</p><p>I have no idea how they plan to cram everything into 2 hours, but I guess we'll see!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.11 You are (not) alone" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">Evangelion 1.11 You are (not) alone</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Not only was this the initial Bluray release for the new movie, but it also adds another 10 or 15 minutes of additional footage into the mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp"  /></p><p>Today, I got it in the mail!  I tore upon the Play-Asia envelope, quickly unwrapped the cellophane and put it into my Playstation 3.  Thanks to the advent of Bluray technology, "they" decided to redistribute which territories fit into which Regions.</p><div class='title'><b>Regions</b></div><p>For DVD Regions, the world was split into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg">6 regions</a>.  Unfortunately, the US and Japan were split.  Japan and Europe were snug into Region 2, but the US and Canada were in Region 1, all alone.</p><p>Bluray is different.  The world is now split into only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg">3 regions</a>.  All of the Americas, Japan and the Philippines occupy the same territory.  And Europe is on the outside with almost everyone else.  That's good!  Now the US has the ability to play Japanese Blurays at our convenience.</p><p>This only gives the ability to play the Bluray, of course.  There is no Bluray magic that transforms the speech into English or anything.  It is what it is.  And this particular Bluray <b>only offers Japanese Audio with no Subtitles</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Why then?</b></div><p>3 months ago, I finally downloaded Eva 1.0 and watched it, though I had a <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">little trouble</a>.  It's kinda weird that I waited so long to finally watch it considering how much I love the Anime.  I watched it and absolutely loved it.  But the quality was pretty bad.  It was good for Internet standards, but there were some scenes that were rough.</p><p>That's the main reason I bought the Bluray.  I wanted to see this film with absolute clarity.  And Evangelion 1.11 does not disappoint.  It is crystal clear and absolutely beautiful.  The sound is amazing too!</p><p>Also, It's not like I need the subtitles, anyways.  After spending so much time getting the subtitles to work on the copy I download back in <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">March</a>, I wondered why I wasted so much time.  I've seen the Anime almost 100 times now and basically have the whole thing memorized.</p><div class='title'><b>Great Bluray, but one problem...</b></div><p>It's annoying that there are no English subtitles.  Half of the reason I buy any movies these days is to share it with people.  And I can't really share this with my friends because they don't know Japanese.  We could attempt to watch it, and I could probably "translate".  But that would really be confusing.  Especially for my friends who've never seen Evangelion before.</p><p>Oh well.  The American release is in November.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Dave, Dan and I caught them for their most recent visit to The Rave in Milwaukee.  They came through the Midwest this weekend on tour of their 4th artist album, Divided by Night.</p><p>It's rather interesting that an electronica group so synonymous and iconic with electronic music has only released 4 artist albums.  These guys are legends and have been heard all over the world.  Even if you're reading this and don't know who The Crystal Method are, chances are that you've heard their music before but didn't know it.</p><p>Their first album, Vegas, which was released back in 1997 has been sampled, optioned, and used all over entertainment.  I was actually quite delighted when they played "Busy Child" during their set this evening. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp"  /></p><p>The Crystal Method rocked!  I've seen them before WAY back in 2002 when they were touring for their first mix album, Community Service.  Unfortunately, I don't have pictures from that event since it was before I owned a camera!</p><p>That night was pretty fun, but they just played their CD basically.  The first 7 songs from their set were mixed almost identically to the first 7 songs of their album.  Event-wise, I think they were too used to playing songs rather than being a DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp"  /></p><p>This was the first time I've seen them perform their music Live and it is a world of difference.  It was an amazing night with a super-friendly crowd that totally got into the music.  Everyone in the audience had a real great time.</p><p>The atmosphere completely changed once The Crystal Method got up on stage.  The aura at the beginning of the night was rather stale and toe-tapping.  It was playful, but the DJ didn't really know how to pump up a crowd.  He'd start building up to something, but then immediately tear it down.  He'd use songs with off-beat bass.  And he ended his set with "Push it" by Salt-n-Pepa.  weird...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp"  /></p><p>Once he left and The Crystal Method took the stage, the audience exploded.  A smile came across everyone's face, and everyone started bouncing around.  Whooo!  It was marvelous. ^_^</p><p>I wonder if they get this sort of attention everywhere, or if it's really unique to The Rave.  At the end of the set, they said that this venue was their favorite amongst the world.  That they've never had a bad crowd in Milwaukee.  I don't know if they were just pandering to the crowd or if they were honest or embellishing, but I'd believe it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pygmy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pygmy">Pygmy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 4, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>One month ago today, Chuck Palahniuk released his 10th novel entitled Pygmy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp"  /></p><p>It's doing pretty well, too.  It debuted as number 3 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html">New York Times Best Seller List</a>.</p><p>For his latest novel, he kept his book tour brief.  He toured only 6 or 7 cities, none of which were in the Midwest.  It's unfortunate, but he did tour twice last year, once for his 9th novel "Snuff" and for "Choke", the film adaption of his 4th novel.  I caught his "Snuff" tour last year: <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">http://theschlock.com/blog/?p=452</a>.</p><p>Much like last year, he announced his next novel.  Next year, Chuck will release his 11th novel entitled "Tell All".  He also mentioned that while caring for his mother last year, he wrote 3 novels, so there's still plenty Chuck down the pipeline.  You can read more about it at <a href="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all" title="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all" title="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all">The Cult</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>St. Helens Book Shop</b></div><p>Even though, I missed him touring, I did purchase a signed first edition of Pygmy from St. Helens Book Shop.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp"  /></p><p>St. Helens Book Shop is Chuck Palahniuk's local book store near Portland, Oregon.  Whenever he's back in town he'll stop by and sign copies of most of his books that they have in stock.  For Pygmy, if you pre-ordered the book through them, Chuck would be in the store the weekend before the book shipped and sign all of their Pre-order editions.  So, that's what I did.  It also has a bunch of tour stamps on it, too.</p><p>This isn't limited to Pygmy or new releases. You can get any Chuck Palahniuk book they have in stock signed or even personalized if you wish.  Which is great, since Chuck Palahniuk tours have attracted some large crowds and no longer has the time to sign everyone's books because of the demand.</p><p>If you're interested check out <a href="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors" title="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors" title="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors">St. Helens Book Shop</a>. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Pygmy</b></div><p>Anyways, I just finished reading Pygmy this afternoon on the bus ride home.</p><p>Pygmy is about a foreign exchange student living in America whose actually an undercover terrorist.  He and his fellow foreign classmates have been tasked to carry out Operation Havoc.  To take down and destroy our lazy American country.  It's a comedy and a romance!</p><p>The number one thing I love about Chuck Palahniuk's writing is how easy they are to read.  It's the reason that kept me reading after Fight Club.  Unfortunately, this book was not an easy read for me.  Pygmy is written from the perspective of the foreign exchange student, so it's ALL broken English.</p><p>That's a feat of its own.  Writing and consistently writing broken English must've driven him insane.  It's daunting at times to read it, but I couldn't imagine writing like this.</p><p>The text itself is pretty funny.  And conveying how odd our society is to a more traditional culture is also pretty hilarious.  But it is exhausting to read.  I finished the book today, and I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of some the characters were.  The broken English is really a crutch that keeps me from enjoying the book at times.</p><div class='title'><b>Variety</b></div><p>But I can hardly condemn the writing style because it's really an adventurous experiment and brings a new dimension to understanding the main character.  Pygmy himself tries to understand America and communication intentions, but they fall flat amongst the American characters in the book.  He brings the misunderstanding back into his own text as he accounts what happened that day.</p><p>Pygmy is incredibly unique.  I'd say it's Chuck's most unique novel yet.  Since Diary, he's really been experimenting with different ways of telling and developing his stories.  Diary was written from the point of someone in a Coma throughout the book.  Haunted contained short stories written by each character involved in a murder scheme.  Rant was from all points of view except the main character.  Snuff focused on 4 main characters who had there own views on the 5th main character.</p><p>His first 5 novels were so similar in style.  It's incredibly interesting to see just how far away from that he's willing to go.  Pygmy is really his first novel since then that was completely written from the main character's perspective and half the time you don't even know what's going on!</p><div class='title'><b>Not Bad</b></div><p>I'd definitely recommend Pygmy if you're interested in reading something you aren't used to.  Even though the writing is a bit different for Chuck, there are still plenty of themes and events that scream his story writing style. ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-museum">Ghibli Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><div class='title'><b>This story begins on eBay.</b></div><p>Since October last year, I've begun selling a lot of my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" /></p><p>There was a store for costumes, one for retro games, one for newer game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp"

Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img

heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, taking pictures inside the Museum was not allowed.  But, the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" /></p><p>The path continued along the back to reveal a Laputa stone.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" /></p><p>There were other spiffy areas in the museum, too.  Like a life-sized Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" /></p><p>This was one of those Sushi restaurant that had a conveyer belt running through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" /></p><p>They had the best California Rolls I've ever eaten.  The avacado was crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/10">« Previous Entries</a></div><div
