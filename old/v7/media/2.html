Its ideas of language learning and development significant struck me because deal with the differences of language and culture on a daily basis in my life and my work living in a foreign country.</p><p>I wrote about these ideas before, and how they inspired me to talk about them to my junior high school classes at the time. You can read them here: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival thoughts from February 2017</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" /></p><p>This year, once again, I'm using this film in my classes to talk about language and learning. My high school class will watch the whole film, and try to understand how the idea of environment and thinking determines the language that society speaks.</p><p>The purpose of the assignment is to understand the ideas the film discusses and not focus so much on the direct translation of what is said. Therefore, I needed Japanese subtitles for the film. English subtitles are pretty easy to find online, but almost every other language is a mixed-bag of low quality machine generated garbage. Japanese subtitles even moreso because of how distant it is from English.</p><p>So, I created a subtitle file that has both English and Japanese, timed perfectly with each other, and each line of dialogue having complete sentences and meaning side-by-side.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view">drive/ Arrival.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG].EnJpDual.ass</a></p><p>I didn't completely translate it myself. I found some Japanese subtitles already created. But, it had several errors and several timings were wrong. All of those problems have been fixed and timed perfectly with the English script.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" /></p><p>The subtitles are in ASS format because SRT does not support dual languages. ASS overwrites size and color, so you'll need to modify the file if you want to change any of that. Although, the size is specifically set for some long sentences to fit perfectly, so I would recommend not enlarging them.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Capsule Machine Capsule" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/capsule-machine-capsule">Capsule Machine Capsule</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I absolutely had to have this thing. I got some change and turned the crank. My first pull gave me a pack of capsules! Pretty meta. I got a capsule ball full of tiny capsule balls. Well, now I needed to roll again to actually get a machine. My second pull was a success! I got the red version of the machine.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Given all the moving parts of this little capsule machine, it was best to leave everything in its package for later.

A miniature capsule machine for my shelf.</p><p>Now that I had one, I needed to have them all! I searched for the set on the Internet and learned what I could. This particular set was called <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ガチャガチャマシーン</span></span>３ (or Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3), and it was released in December 2021. So, it was already out in the wild for 3 months. I learned that you can buy full distributions of some capsule times on Amazon.  For Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3 that consisted of 24 capsules, which was 3 complete sets of 8 items: 3 red machines, 3 white machines, 1 pack of capsules, and 1 set of metal shelves.  So, the Capsules I had gotten were a 1/8 rare pull. The red machine was a typical 3/8 pull.</p><p>I continued searching on Yahoo Auctions to find someone selling the missing items in my set, but most people were selling a full set of 8 or selling the rare pulls for a lot of money. Eh. I gave up. One capsule machine is good enough. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Update - March 2023</b></div><p>This has continued to nag at me over the last year. The other day, I was back on Yahoo Auctions looking around and I saw an auction for the two unique pieces of the set I was missing: the white capsule machine and a set of the shelving. It was only $10, so why not?</p><p>Not long after they arrived in the mail. The White capsule machine was in perfect condition, looking amazing and working well. The shelving was not. The piece had clearly been sitting in the sun for an extended period of time because the rods were warped.

The film is told with subtle movements, occasionally abstract visuals, and ambient overwhelming music that guides you forward through the story. There are a few action sequences, but they serve more as a bullet point to the overall story being told.</p><p>It is directed by Denis Villenueve, who also directed Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, two of my absolute favorite films of the last few years. The motion picture score is done by Hans Zimmer, who wrote the music of Blade Runner 2049 and many Christopher Nolan films. While his Nolan scores are very similar, the music of Dune sets itself apart to build a dreamlike state.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Story of Dune</b></div><p>The story of Dune begins its focus on Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides and heir to their House. House Atreides has become strong in both political and military power within the houses of the known universe, so the Emperor decides to install them as fief of Arrakis, Dune, deposing House Harkonen. House Harkonen have a long hatred of the Atreides, and the Emperor uses this opportunity to push the Harkonens to wipeout House Atreides.</p><p>Paul is the son of Lady Jessica, a devout member of the Bene Gesserit, a secret order of women who train their bodies and minds to obtain superhuman abilities seen as magic to outsiders. Over centuries, they have carefully steered bloodlines of the powerful Houses of the universe to birth a human with the most powerful mental abilities ever seen. They believe this person would be able to control the known universe and bring everlasting peace. Lady Jessica gave birth to Paul in defiance of the order, giving him the seeds of this power. </p><p>Arrakis is the most politically important planet in the universe. The surface is covered in desert, and within the sands is a substance called spice. Spice is a powerful hallucinogen that will unlock a person's mind to its full capabilities. Genetically engineered and breed humans of the Spacing Guild use its power to unlock intergalactic space travel allowing humans to travel across galaxies. It is the most important and priceless substance in the universe. Those who control Arrakis harvest the spice and sell it within the universe's market, giving them immense wealth.</p><p>Prior to Paul's arrival on Arrakis, he has dreams showing his possible futures. On Arrakis, these dreams lead him to understanding the culture of native Arrakins known as Fremen. Spice opens and unlocks his mind to more dreams powerful and predictive. As his House is attacked and destroyed by the Harkonens, he and his mother are forced in the desert where the spice surrounds him. They find the Fremen and are accepted into their city.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Meaning of Dune</b></div><p>Dune 2021 is only Part 1 of a long long story that lasts thousands of years. It's doubtful that this movie series will actually make it that far, though. I think Villeneuve has said he only plans on adapting Paul's story, and not continuing the story of his children which continue into millennia. There is such a huge time gap, and it's somewhat disconnected from the purpose of the story, anyway.</p><p>Overall, the meaning and purpose of Dune is to show the consequences of faith and charismatic leadership.</p><p>The Bene Gesserit have seeded prophecy across the universe. Over generations, simple rumors and tales of a promised warrior destined to save their people from evil has turned into religion and faith. These religions consume planets and create populations of devote followers. All under the guise of the Bene Gesserit projecting themselves as deities.</p><p>The Arrakins and Fremen see Paul arrive on Dune and they see this prophet. Paul's interest and obsession of Arrakis as well as his mental conditioning allows him to quickly adapt and understand their culture. Arrakins confuse this as prophecy. All they have ever known is oppression and with the emergence of hope, they cling to it and force themselves and Paul into it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" /></p><p>Spoilers, but this will be the center-piece of Dune Part 2. Continuing with further spoilers, ultimately, this holy crusade is inevitable and worlds worth of people and civilizations die as a result. That'll be Dune Part 3, which I hope to god they are able to make.</p><div class='title'><b>The Weight of Responsibility</b></div><p>Something Dune Part 1 does exceedingly well is show how Paul takes reluctant responsibility. There have been many stories of reluctant heroes, and they always whine about not wanting to do what they have to do. Paul states at the beginning that he does not want to lead.</p><p>With the death of his father, he is now Duke Atreides. He doesn't try to ignore his potential political power as head of his House. He thinks of ways of how to use it to turn the situation into his favor. He accepts his responsibility.</p><p>In the final act of the film, a Fremen warrior forces him into combat where the victor is determined by the death of the other. Paul easily outmatches him, but attempts to find a middle ground having never actually killed before. While other stories would have the hero give up or whine about it, Paul understands that he must kill. And so he does.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" /></p><p>This death weighs on him. Yes, it's his first kill, but it's also the first direct casualty on his path forward. A path that he is forced to take and he will not back down from. He confirms this by saying that his road leads into the desert, not off world.

Prior to the film's release, Hans Zimmer released <b>The Dune Sketchbook</b>, which featured music from the movie but presented them in a meandering build, like he was trying to find the sound from his ideas, like an artist uses a sketchbook. As such, some tracks are very even and don't really work together as a complete album.</p><p>A few weeks later, <b>Dune The Motion Picture Soundtrack</b> was released. This album had 22 tracks of score that was directly included in the film. No extras or changes like the Sketchbook. However, tracks that were extended in the Sketchbook were not included in the Soundtrack. </p><p>After the movie was released, I combined both albums together to create a more complete musical journey analogous to the build of the film. Some sketchbook tracks didn't work as they were too uneven, so I put Moon Over Caladan first, and removed Song of the Sisters. If you did include Sone of the Sisters, it would go after The One, but I think it breaks up the movement from the Gom Jabbar to Leaving Caladan. It also has redundant sounds from Bene Gesserit.</p><p>Here is my arranged tracklisting combining both albums.</p><p class='img'><table class="tracklisting"><tr><td class="number">1.</td><td class="title">Moon Over Caladan</td><td class="notes">The Dune Sketchbook — Track 6</td></tr><tr><td class="number">2.</td><td class="title"> Dream of Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">3.</td><td class="title"> Herald of the Change </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">4.</td><td class="title">I See You in My Dreams</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">5.</td><td class="title"> Bene Gesserit </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">6.</td><td class="title"> Gom Jabbar </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">7.</td><td class="title"> The One </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">—</td><td> Song of the Sisters </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">8.</td><td class="title">Paul's Dream</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">9.</td><td class="title"> Leaving Caladan </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 6 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">10.</td><td class="title"> House Atreides </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">11.</td><td class="title"> Arrakeen </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">12.</td><td class="title"> Ripples in the Sand </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">13.</td><td class="title"> The Shortening of the Way </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">14.</td><td class="title"> Visions of Chani </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 9 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">15.</td><td class="title"> Night on Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 10 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">16.</td><td class="title"> Armada </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 11 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">17.</td><td class="title"> Burning Palms </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 12 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">18.</td><td class="title"> Stranded </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 13 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">19.</td><td class="title"> Blood for Blood </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 14 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">20.</td><td class="title"> The Fall </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 15 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">21.</td><td class="title"> Holy War </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 16 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">22.</td><td class="title"> Sanctuary </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 17 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">23.</td><td class="title"> Premonition </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 18 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">24.</td><td class="title"> Ornithopter </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 19 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">25.</td><td class="title"> Sandstorm </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 20 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">26.</td><td class="title"> Shai-hulud </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">27.</td><td class="title"> Stillsuits </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 21 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">28.</td><td class="title"> Mind Killer </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">29.</td><td class="title"> My Road Leads into the Desert </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 22 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">30.</td><td class="title"> Grains of Sand </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 9 </td></tr></table>A third album was released to accompany an art book, <b>The Art and Soul of Dune</b>. All of these tracks are ambient versions of music already included in the previous two albums. It's meant as a background accompaniment as you read and view the content of the book. Overall, because they're too ambient and usually redundant, they don't really fit into my arrangement.<b>The Lore of Dune</b>Dune has always been a story and world that many people have considered impossible to adapt (yet this is the third adaptation). After watching the 1984 film and 2000 television mini-series, it seems like it's pretty easy to adapt. Although, both productions are severely flawed. Also, I've never read the book, so I don't know what I'm talking about.Apparently the books are incredibly dense with lore that would completely slow down and obscure any movie or TV show. Watching videos on YouTubes and reading about Dune online, completes the picture for me as Dune 2021 skips over A LOT of stuff.Prior to watching to watching Dune 2021 in theaters, I didn't know anything about the story or lore of Dune. What I had seen before, I had completely forgotten. But, I was still able to understand character motivations and what everyone was doing. The story in Dune 2021 is presented well enough that you don't need encyclopedic knowledge of the source material. On the reverse side, if you have this encyclopedic knowledge, I think it only enhances what is going on.You don't need to know that humans have completely rejected computers and robots, and that people have been engineered, trained, and conditioned into biological thinking computers, called <I>mentats</I>. That's what this guy is, by the way.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" />The movie doesn't tell you that Paul has also been trained as a mentat, which gives him the ability to learn about Arrakis and the Fremen incredibly quickly.Everything you need to know about the overall lore of Dune is hinted at or mentioned briefly. Despite not giving you enough information, the movie respects the viewer enough to make those connections in the future, or review the source material to confirm your connections.<b>The Future of Dune</b>The end of Dune Part 1 is the most jarring part of the film. There's no real ending to the film at all. It just stops. I suppose this was alluded to at the beginning when the full title of the film "Dune Part 1" was revealed. It makes sense as this is a single part of an overall story, but it's still jarring. Dune Part 2 will continue directly where Part 1 ends. And I expect Dune Part 3 will be the conclusion of Paul Atreides story. Denis Villeneuve has professed in interviews that he is a lifelong fan of Dune, and it has always been his dream to create a series of motion pictures that perfectly capture and encapsulate the story of Paul Atreides. I imagine that we will get a complete trilogy of Paul's story. But, the further story of his children may or may not be told.I imagine that Villeneuve will probably move on to something else after three Dune films, but the greedy studio will push ahead with Children of Dune. I suppose that is our problem in the future to deal with.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" />I eagerly anticipate what will come in the future.</p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Edge of Tomorrow" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/edge-of-tomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

One year prior, Tom Cruise starred in Oblivion, which wasn't that great. I think the reception of that film hurt this one quite a bit because people didn't want to see another stinker. At the time, I think Tom Cruise was seen as very humorless and self-serious because of viral clips online. But, his ideas created a lot of the humor and light-hearted situations in this film.</p><div class='title'><b>William Cage</b></div><p>Tom Cruise portrays William Cage, the head of an advertising firm forced to join humanity's army because of his ROTC training in college. He is a coward and does marketing in the guise of journalism for the army to sway humanity's trust into their war efforts.

He's arrested and thrown into the army with the new recruits.</p><p>While training with the new recruits, he doesn't know how to operate his weapons, he tries to run away from battle, and tries to convince others to get him out. In the battle, he squadmates are killed by alien enemies, known as Mimics, while he avoids getting hurt. As a final act, before the enemy kills him, he grabs a claymore mine and sacrifices himself as he blows away the enemy towering over him.

The goal of this class is for students to become more familiar with listening to and speaking native English with correct feelings and expressions. The majority of the class focuses on listening. Students will get a script with various words missing from the dialogue. While listening and watching the scene, they'll fill in the blanks with what's missing. We'll also go through the meaning so students can keep up with the story.</p><p>These listening activities lead to Performance Tests. Rather than doing a final Listening Test for the unit, students will make pairs and perform a scene from the film. Students will not only memorize and say the correct dialogue, but must act the scene with correct expression and feelings with their voice, face, eyes, and body.</p><p>The first performance test is when Cage meets Rita on the battlefield after days of trying to save her. From his actions, she realizes and understands Cage's situation. She throws down her weapon, and exclaims, "Find me when you wake up." Cage confused by the response replies, "What?" Rita, one more time clearly orders, "Come find me when you wake up," and they're both killed by an explosion.</p><p>Because the dialogue is so short, students exchange roles. My grading mainly focuses on the student performing as Rita. Cage's response is important to support Rita's dialogue, but ultimately it's Rita's dialogue that is key to this scene. Students must make a distinction between how the dialogue is said first compared to the second time when it is so clear, without any misunderstanding.</p><p>Again, check the <a href="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow">course page</a> for the full performance criteria, as well as worksheets.</p><div class='title'><b>Defeating the Mimics</b></div><p>Following orders, Cage ditches his squad during training to find Rita during her training.

With the enemy destroyed and inert, the war is over and the battle is no longer necessary. All of his squad members are alive having never entered battle. Rita, too. The film ends with Cage meeting Rita at the base.</p><div class='title'><b>Morals</b></div><p>There are several morals to be learned from the film that I like to imbue on students. The first moral or lesson is the importance of repetition and continuous efforts towards your goal. Winning the entire war seemed absolutely impossible at the beginning of the film, but it was through Cage's reluctant yet continuous efforts that he gained the confidence and knowledge needed to win.</p><p>Additionally, he was not successful on his first attempt or even his fiftieth attempt. Cage constantly experienced failure and learned from his failures every day to progress further and further to eventually achieve victory. These efforts ultimately rewarded him with the ability to know what to do in an unknown situation when he no longer had the ability to reset the day at the end.</p><p>Also, through all of his daily failures, he showed his bravery. In the beginning, he was a coward who would do anything to run away from battle and danger. But, even on his first day, he showed bravery by killing himself to destroy the Alpha. That small showing of bravery gave him this power, and each day he showed more bravery trying to save his squad mates, and save Rita, too.</p><p>One of the key quotes in the film is <b>"Battle is the Great Redeemer."</b> Battle shows a person who they truly are as they shed whatever person they were in society. Cage was ultimately victorious because, at heart, he was courageous and brave. When pushed to the ultimate limit, what kind of person are you, really?</p><p>All morals are important for life, and the film shows this through Cage's journey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Original Script Ending</b></div><p>The finished film we received has a pretty happy ending overall, and doesn't necessarily play by its rules at the end. The whole film Cage always goes back to the base. But now, just to wrap everything up in a nice bow, he goes back to before he dishonored himself with the general, escaping punishment. His overall sacrifice ended up rewarding him with a happy ending.</p><p>The original script was not so kind. Leading to the final battle, it seemed like the Omega knew they were coming. One of Cage's squad mates even yells this out, "They know we're coming, man!" This is because, in the original script, in this battle previously, they had killed an Alpha. Killing an Alpha resets the day, but anyone outside of the Omega living that day wouldn't know it. </p><p>The Omega knows they are coming, and kills them all off one by one. The Mimics take over the Earth, and humanity is lost.</p><p>Tom Cruise and the production crew did not like this ending for several reasons. Thematically, it didn't really fit with the direction of the story towards the end. It didn't make sense for Cage to learn everything and grow, just to be killed in the end. Also, it wouldn't balance the overall feelings of the film. There are some comedic moments, but everything is so tense. There needs to be some relief. And, we've seen everyone die over and over again throughout the film that seeing more death wouldn't really have the weight to it.</p><p>I think they made the right choice.</p><div class='title'><b>Novel Differences and Ending</b></div><p>Edge of Tomorrow is adapted from a Japanese "light" novel entitled, <b>All You Need Is Kill</b>, by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.

In addition to Drones, Alphas, and the Omega, there are also <b>Antennas</b>. For every Alpha, there is an Antenna, and the Antennas receive the signals sent from the Alpha to trigger the Omega to restart the day. For Rita and Cage to destroy the Omega, they must first destroy all of the Antennas, and then the Omega.</p><p>In the end, Cage and Rita (actually his name isn't Cage in this, but it doesn't matter) eventually destroy every Antenna and land the final blow on the Omega. But, the day resets. Even killing all the Antenna didn't work. This was because an Antenna still existed.</p><p>Much like Edge of Tomorrow, Rita had previously gained the time power from fighting in Verdun. But, when she lost the power, she didn't lose it completely. She became an Antenna and Cage is her Alpha. All Antenna must be killed. So, after killing all other Antenna, Cage and Rita face each other, and Cage delivers the final blow. He then destroys the Omega, ending the war.</p><p>Out of the three endings, I like this one the best. Rita can finally make her sacrifice that she decided on earlier. She's able to join everyone who died with her at Verdun, and the rest of the world is able to survive the Mimic invasion.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>Even with these three endings, people online have come up with lots of other ideas for endings. Also, recently (2024), there have been talks with Tom Cruise and Warner Bros to make a possibly sequel. With such a happy ending, there is still room to have more time shenanigans. So, how will they continue the story? What could they do?</p><p>Concluding class, I ask students to come up with a premise for the sequel.</p><p>One of the more creative endings from fans was Cage still retaining the time power from the Omega. After living his life with Rita, Cage finally dies of old age. But then, he wakes up back at the beginning of the final battle only to live his life again. The film could revolve around Cage becoming a bit of a demigod with the time power warping him. Ultimately, Cage has to figure out how to truly die.</p><p>Overall, <b>Edge of Tomorrow</b> is an incredible film. It's one of my strongest classes that revolve around a film. There's so much good in the film. This post is pretty long, and I never even talked about <b>Bill Paxton's</b> incredible performance as Master Sergeant Ferill. </p><p>I already spoiled the whole movie, but if you've made it this far without seeing it, you've gotta see it.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Legend of Crystania Memorabilia" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crystania-memorabilia">Legend of Crystania Memorabilia</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Unlike any of movie, it wasn't because of the story, characters, art, or music. It was because, 14 years ago, my college friends and I and over 25 members of our college anime club, SPAMM, created a feature length fandub of the film. To this day, I have yet to know anything about the official story or characters other than it's connection to Lodoss War.</p><p>Our film was entitled The Secret of Crystania, and you can view it here: <br/><b><a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">theschlock.com/the-secret-of-crystania</a></b></p><p>Every since moving to Japan, I often go to Yahoo Auctions and when I'm there, I always search for Crystania. Over the last 10 years, many pieces of Crystania memorabilia has surfaced. Usually the prices are very cheap compared to well known anime productions of the time, so buying these things has worked on quite well. Recently, some very interesting things has shown up there, too.</p><p>I have scanned in all of my memorabilia, and you can take a look at it all below.</p><div class='title'><b>Theatrical Run Items</b></div><p>The Legend of Crystania premiered in Japanese theaters during the Tsunogawa Anime Festival on July 29th, 1995. It was part of a double feature along with the Slayers movie. Obviously, Slayers was incredibly popular, so people were basically suckered into seeing Crystania, too.</p><p>I have found a ticket from that event, which has a March 27th, 1995 date on it for some reason. Were they selling tickets that far in advance? Looking around all tickets have that date on them. I don't know why.</p><p>Additionally, I found a flyer for the premiere event as well as a film pamphlet. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As films release in Japan, theaters will sell a pamphlet book of the film with shots from the film, story explanation, and occasionally production notes, interviews, and other behind the scenes stuff. This particular book also has several pages of ads for additional Crystania mechandise. Most of the time these books are sold, but maybe these were given away with the premiere. I've scanned the pamphlet and the flyer and included them below.</p><p>Legend of Crystania - Film Pamphlet (20 pages)<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>パンフレット</span></span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/">https://drive.google.com/.../1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm</a></p><p>Slayers / Legend of Crystania Premiere Flyer<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>スレイヤーズ</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>映画</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>チラシ</span></span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/">https://drive.google.com/.../1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy</a></p><div class='title'><b>Home Release Items</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original home release of Legend of Crystania was on VHS in Japan on March 8th, 1996. But, it was a decaying format and LaserDisc was the new hotness. LaserDisc took an incredible hold in Japan and almost all the modern popular anime releases got a LaserDisc release through the late 90s. The LaserDisc version of Crystania was released on March 23rd, 1996, and by the end of the year, the 3-part 6-episode OAV sequel was released on LaserDisc, too.</p><p>The LaserDisc version of Legend of Crystania is the most high quality release to date. In America, we got a DVD version in 2000, but the DVD version released by ADV was a transfer of the LaserDisc. Additionally, the American DVD has subtitles and other English edits burned directly onto the video. This cuts out some of the original video.</p><p>I picked up two copies of the movie as they weren't too expensive.</p><p>The VHS tape shows up on Yahoo Auctions from time to time, but I think it's unnecessary to own since the LaserDisc is the definitive version.</p><div class='title'><b>Animation Cels</b></div><p>Around 7 years ago, as I was looking through Yahoo Auctions, I first searched for Crystania and saw that some was selling animation cels. I had always dreamed or had a fantasy of owning animation cels of Crystania, but owning such things seemed incredible cost prohibited in my mind, considering cels of popular shows go for hundreds of dollars.  </p><p>Luckily, Crystania is not popular, nor even really all that good. I purchased my first cels and posted about it here: <a href="/old/v7/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania" title="/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania" title="/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania">theschlock.com/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania</a>.</p><p>The years went on, and occasionally more and more cels would appear on Yahoo Auctions. Today, I own 15 cels from the film. I have scanned them all, and added them in the gallery below.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Production Collections</b></div><p>Recently, these two items appeared on Yahoo Auctions and I immediately put all of my money behind acquiring them.

She puts in all of her efforts in each of her scenes to bring out feelings of tension and mystery. Her acting is very expressive which makes it easy for students to understand her thoughts and feelings without necessarily understanding what is said. Broussard does a pretty good job with this, too, and complements Rothe together as Tree and Carter.</p><p>Another reason that I really like the film is the overall journey Teresa takes from beginning to end.

Sections of listening are often followed by double-checking the meaning of the dialogue.</p><p>The main fun of the course are the performance tests. Two students will make a pair and perform dialogue together. The full grading criteria is on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. Grading for the performance test is based on the correctness of the spoken dialogue, the expressiveness, and also cooperation between both members because acting isn't something done alone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first performance scene is about 25 minutes in the film between Tree and Lori. Tree has already been killed twice, so she confesses to Lori about what's going on and how she feels. Lori doesn't believe her. In the scene, one student is Tree, and one student is Lori. While performing the dialogue, they should correctly show these emotions through their voice, body movements, and facial movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The second performance test is way more intense. After dying 5 or 6 times, Tree is sent to hospital. The killer is there, too, but Tree escapes in Gregory's car. She's then pulled over and arrested on an empty highway. She thought she had gotten away, but the killer catches up with her and confronts her in the back of the police car. Through frustration, fear, and confusion, she snaps at the killer. "What do you want? Why are you doing this? Who are you?"</p><p>This is the performance. One student stands over the other, and Teresa says these words with passion and emotion. Then, they switch roles. I think it's easy for students to understand her frustration and fear, but students should really try to push their voices to match the emotion. Not too loud, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final performance is the opposite. After realizing her terrible behavior and how she has treated her father, Teresa finally meets him at the restaurant and apologizes. She holds his hands, and whole heartedly says, "I'm sorry" and "I love you."</p><p>In a pair, one student is Teresa and the other is the father. They hold hands, and one student expresses these words to the other. This isn't so easy to do. Eye Contact is important. Also, students should try to think of their own parents to correctly express their feelings.

I think their motive makes sense, and the opportunities for her to commit the murders makes sense. Some people online aren't so convinced and complain about it, but the movie doesn't take itself so seriously that everything has to make total sense.</p><p>There is an alternate ending where Gregory's wife, Stephanie, is the killer. I think her motive makes more sense, but her opportunities do not. Perhaps Stephanie and Lori working together would be best.</p><p>Either way, I feel like Happy Death Day never really got its chance to shine. Nobody really talks about this movie enough.</p><p>There is a sequel, <b>Happy Death Day 2U</b>, but the hard turn from horror into science fiction and a further lean into comedy, which is often too slapstick, probably turned off its audience. A third movie to complete the trilogy is set up at the end, but it was never given the green light. 2U came out in 2019, so the pandemic also helped killed the three-qual.</p><p>Both movies together are pretty fun, and definitely recommended.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock">Schlock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was 30 minutes long, and only showed movie trailers.  Mostly trailers for new movies, but some old ones, too.</p><p>One such episode featured a movie called Schlock<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY</a></p><p>It was one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, hilarious-not-hilarious, trying-too-hard things I'd ever seen at that point.  Over the next few years, I searched around pawn stores, video stores, and old rental stores trying to find a copy of it on VHS, but it seemed like no one even heard of it.<br/>The name was pretty unique, so I used it as my screen name for AOL and everything else since.</p><p>In October 2001, it was finally released on DVD, and on my birthday that year, I was finally able to see it.  I had a bunch of people over to my dorm room, both friends from MN and college.</p><p>It didn't necessarily live up to my expectations, but I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, there were some pretty great moments in the film.  I don't really think any of my friends had quite the reactions I did.</p><p>For the last 17 years, the Schlock DVD had become quite scarce.  I think 10 years ago, the DVDs were going for the same price they are now, $150.</p><p>But now, once again in my birthday month, Schlock has been released again, now on Bluray, and in a rather nice package.  The booklet had a story about how John Landis scrapped together what he had to make it.  There's a reversible cover.  The movie is a 4k restoration.  There's a few commentary tracks.  New interviews.  Old TV spots, and other things.

| February 11, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Blade Runner 2049 was a very overwhelming film when I saw it the first time.  A lot of that came from the sound, music, and visuals.</p><p>The sound and music are very loud and unnerving.  It helps describe the enormity of the future and density of the city.  Much of the music drips of wet industry.  Loud sprawling flanges in wide shots.  Silence and subtle tones in movement.  The technology of the future feels organic and grown out of past that incorporated the technology into itself, rather than began anew.</p><p>The art design compliments the music well.  The future iterates on the future shown 30 years ago in the original Blade Runner.  Displays are blocky monitors rather than flashy holograms.  Communication is done through these displays, rather than a smartphone-like device that keeps constant communication between people.  The future also feels organic and lived-in.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner</b></div><p>The premise of Blade Runner is that a corporation has developed technology to essentially manufacture people.  Replicants are not mechanical robots or cyborgs or something like that.  They are a completely organic manufactured person.  Designed to be less emotional and strong, they are mainly used off-world as a physical workforce or soldiers or whatever dirty-work humans don’t want to do.</p><p>In the first film, replicants are Nexus-6 models made by the Tyrell Corporation and are illegal to bring to earth.  Blade Runners are a section of the police force to capture or take out rogue replicants that somehow get to earth.  The main plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard, a blade runner, as he tracks down 4 rogue Nexus-6 models that have come to Los Angeles.  One significant aspect of the Nexus-6 model is their 4 year lifespan, which was used as a security deterrent if they were ever lost or escaped.  </p><p>The secondary plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard’s relationship with Rachael, who is a prototype Nexus-7 model.  She was given memories and believes herself to be human.  The memories define her as a person, and as such cannot be easily detected as a replicant.  They’ve removed the lifespan limit as well.  The film also famously toys with the idea of whether or not Deckard himself is a Nexus-7 model, too.</p><p>As a result of the events of Blade Runner, the Nexus-6 models were deemed too unstable or uncontrollable for continued use, and Nexus-7 models never went to manufacturing and their designs lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner 2049</b></div><p>Nexus-8 models were quickly developed by the Tyrell Corporation and sent to market.  Models had registration numbers imprinted on their eyes, and records of all models were kept in a central database.  Replicants were easy to tell apart from humans.  But the public rejected them because of how violent and problematic the Nexus-6 models were.  Many models were hunted down and killed in the streets on Earth.  This led to the events described in the short film, Blackout 2022.  Two replicants successfully destroy the database and detonate an EMP above Los Angeles to erase all records of Nexus-8 models.</p><p>From that point on, replicants became strictly illegal.  All surviving Nexus-6 models died naturally.  Nexus-8 models went into hiding.  The Tyrell Corporation went out of business.</p><p>Over the next decade, the infrastructure of Earth begins to deteriorate with the loss of the replicant workforce.  There are not enough people to sustain the ecosystem.  Niander Wallace of the Wallace Corporation buys the Tyrell Corporation and begins developing the Nexus-9 model of replicants.  These models are have the same feature of the Nexus-8 models, but designed to be absolutely loyal.</p><p>In the short film, Nexus Dawn 2036, Niander Wallace brings his new Nexus-9 model before congress, states his claim that humanity needs replicants and that the replicant-ban be revoked, and then demonstrates their obedience.  Congress moves to revoke the ban, allowing Wallace to mass-produce Nexus-9 replicants and help rebuild the Earth’s environment.</p><p>In Blade Runner 2049, the main character is a Nexus-9 replicant, KD6-3.7, or "K" for short, played by Ryan Gosling.  He works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner tracking down remaining Nexus-8 models.</p><div class='title'><b>Cells Interlinked</b></div><p>To verify K’s operational stability, he is subject to a baseline recalibration test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" /></p><p>The test asks him a series of questions followed by a word of phrase he is meant to repeat.  The replicant is not meant to think or respond to the question, only the subsequent phrase.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the film is how K’s obedience gradually and subtly erodes over time.  Much like the test, within his police work, he is meant to avoid or deflect questions while getting answers.  Within his investigation and daily life, every question is a test.  In the beginning, he doesn’t waver.  Sapper asks him questions.  He ignored them.  Luv asks him questions.  He deflects.</p><p>Besides answering to his boss, played by Robin Wright, it’s only when Mackenzie Davis asks him a question, "What’s this?"  "A tree," that he responds directly to someone else’s question.  The first failure of the baseline test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" /></p><p>Later, he speaks with Robin Wright about the case and she asks him a direct question of the case, "What do these numbers mean?" or "Do these numbers mean anything to you?"  He replies, "No."  A lie.</p><p>As K continues to investigate the whereabouts of a replicant born into this world, rather than manufactured, and as he starts to believe that he is that child, he starts to question his obedience and loyalty.  In following scenes, his stern emotionless face begins to crack under the weight of his feelings.  Through his blank face, we can feel his sadness, frustration, and confusion.</p><p>Blade Runner 2049 follows K’s transformation from a mindless "robot" into someone fighting for himself and others and what he believes is the right course of action.</p><div class='title'><b>Imagery</b></div><p>Because the movie centers on K and his lack of emotion, so many scenes feel sterile and emotionally distant even though they are gorgeous.</p><p>I went through the film and picked out many images that shows the beauty of Blade Runner 2049’s art direction in set design, costume design, and visuals.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Denis Villeneuve</b></div><p>So, Blade Runner 2049 was definitely my favorite film of 2017.  It was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who directed my favorite film of 2016, too, <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.  Both movies were continuations and adaptations of previous works, but had a voice of their own, presented with a tense atmospheric soundtrack and beautiful visuals that engaged me completely.  I haven’t really seen any of his other films, but I’m definitely going to pay attention to whatever he does next.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Arrival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/arrival">Arrival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And through learning the language, her thought process changes, her perception of time begins to change, and she’s able to view parts of her future. Because she’s able to understand and process their language, she’s able to think like them and perceive time like them.</p><p>This is the central plot of the movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Human Examples</b></div><p>Let’s go back to our previous sentence, and compare it with some other languages.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.<br/>Je marche à l'école tous les jours.<br/>Yo camino a la escuela todos los dias.<br/>Ich gehe taglich zur Schule.</code></p><p>There’s English, French, Spanish, and German.  Each has its own sound and ring, but the basic sentence structure is the same.  I walk.  Je marche.  Yo camino.  Ich gehe.</p><p>The very first thing we care about in the sentence is "who" followed immediately by "what is he/she/it doing."  After that, everything else is details.</p><p>I think this is because our culture, personalities, and attitudes tend to be very direct.  Or we tend to favor people and ideas that are very direct.  If we can quickly and succinctly communicate the who/what and it’s action, we can understand the idea faster and fuller.</p><p>So, how does this compare with Japanese.</p><p><code><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>私は毎日学校に歩いて行きます。</span></span></code></p><p>First is the subject (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>私</span></span> <i>watashi</i> or I), but the verb is the very last thing in the sentence (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>行きます</span></span> <i>ikimasu</i> go).  All of the other details are explained before the actual actions.  I think this is because Japanese language and culture tends to be indirect a lot of the time.</p><p>The Japanese teacher in class went on to give some examples of indirectness in Japanese, such as refusing an invitation.  In English, when refusing an invitation, we typically say something like, "Sorry, I can’t" or "I’m busy," and then maybe followed by a reason.  The refusal can be softer, but typically the first thing we say is very direct, "I can’t."</p><p>In Japanese, such directness could be considered rude or harsh, so the polite way to refuse is to be more indirect.  "Sorry.  On that day, I’ll be out of town"  or "Sorry, I already have another engagement on that day."  There’s no real reason to say "I can’t" because it’s implied, and because of that those harsh words are never said.</p><div class='title'><b>Switching Brains</b></div><p>As long as I’ve been learning Japanese, people have always mentioned the idea that they’re able to "switch their brain" when fully immersed in Japanese.  They claim they think in Japanese and speaking Japanese becomes more natural to them.  Sometimes they need to stop for a second to switch from talking in one language to the other.  </p><p>This idea is the foundation behind the plot of <b>Arrival</b>.  Louise can change switch her brain when communicating in the alien language, and then be able to perceive her current and future memories at a single time.</p><p>This has never been the case for me.  Over these last 4 years of living here, and 15 years since first learning Japanese, I’ve really just maintained a single mode of thought.  My thought process always tends to translate and interpret the incoming Japanese into something I can understand.  Outgoing, too, has a quick translation from English to Japanese.</p><p>Though, this single mode of thought has changed and been molded over time by all the language and culture I’ve absorbed and learned by living here.  For certain kinds of grammar and vocabulary, I can say them pretty fast.  It just feels more instinctual rather than a complete switch.  Through practice, I feel like I’ve simply trained my brain rather than developed something completely separate.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Cove and Taiji, Wakayama 太地町" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama">The Cove and Taiji, Wakayama 太地町</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was really the first time I had taken a "reality" tour for a film.</p><p>Though, the whole trip was shadowed by the overwhelming sense of being watched and unwanted.  People just didn't seem friendly at all.  I was taking some photos and saw some junior high students walking by.  I said, "Hello," and got nothing back.  They just looked at me as if I had no business being there.  Shopkeepers were very short with their dialog, too.</p><p>Perhaps thats because the usual foreigners that visit Taiji knew about the city from the film, so the local people assume they're there to do them harm.</p><p>The town just didn't feel right.  Or perhaps that overwhelming emotional baggage skewed my view of the place.</p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
