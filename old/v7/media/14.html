| March 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Despite considering alternatives, i decided to get in my car and drive up to the twin cities to check out Digweed at that new club in maplewood.  I'd never been a big fan of Digweed..  His Kiss 100 sets never really stuck with me, and i never really listened to his CDs at great length.  I finally just the chance to see him back in 2004 (<a href="/old/v7/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis">pics</a>), and it blew me away.  His progressive style is really brought out by the massive amounts of bass pumped into the atmosphere.  I was quite turned around after that point ^_^.</p><p>On the way up, i stopped off at Best Buy and as luck would have it, they had a copy of Digweed's new CD, Transitions vol. 2.  It's a great listen ^_^</p><p>I got to Myth around 10pm and crap!  This place is huge.  I thought it was pretty hilarious that they a built a club right next to Maplewood mall, but think of the convience!  Hardly any traffic and parking up to wazoo.  Now you'll actually get the people that care about being at that club..  Not just a bunch of drunks bar hopping around Minneapolis' warehouse district.  It's still kinda weird though..  Big fancy ass club nestled in between an Ashley's furniture and Toys R Us.  I probably should've taken a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" /></p><p>Anywho, as i got inside the air was filled with the incredible sounds of Eccentric Beats, Phil Martinez and his pal.  The air was also filled with smoke.  I walked past some staff saying that they couldn't stop it..  By it, they meant the smoke machines, not a fire.  I thought it was rather odd that there was this much smoke in the building..  I mean, you couldn't see but several feet in front of you.</p><p>15 minutes later, this bit the club in the ass as the fire alarm went off.  I thought it was pretty hilarious that some people were still dancing to the fire alarm before they realized it WAS a fire alarm.  Hell, i thought it was music too for a couple of moments.</p><p>The fire alarm went on for about another 15 minutes before they finally got their act together and fixed the problem..  How embarrassing..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" /></p><p>Eventually eccentric beats finally got control of the sound system back and began to rip tracks and tear up the place, but not before Jack Trash came up with a little bit of an announcement.  Mstrkrft, the other main attraction, were apparently stuck in their hotel's elevator upon their embarkment to Myth.  So JT got Digweed to the club as fast as possible while Hotel security tried to free Mstrkrft from their cage.</p><p>It certainly seemed like it was the night of disasters.. jesus.  In fact, Mstrkrft ended up being stuck in that elevator all night and finally got to the club around 2am.. closing time.  But, this meant a full 2 hour long set by Digweed, so it worked out great for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" /></p><p>Digweed came out on stage and began his set around Midnight.  Amazing.  Bass filled the air, and pounded my body.  I was bathed in rich creamy Sound.   Unfortunately, since i don't listen to Digweed all that often, i couldn't trainspot any of the tracks..  His Transitions CD is a good vantage point to reliving this music though...  you just need a wall of bass to actually experience it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" /></p><p>Anywho, my pictures are rather few from this event since i was rocking out up front the entire time in anticipation of getting my Transitions CD signed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" /></p><p>Success!  Why yes, that is the Communicate Vinyl that guy has holding in front of me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07556.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07556.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07556.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07556.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07556.webp" /></p><p>I should've brought in some of my Global Underground CDs of his though..  oh well..  here's the rest of the pictures: <a href="/old/v7/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">http://www.theschlock.com/photo/070309_digweed/</a>.<br/>_____</p><p>I did run into some old friends from Platteville: Andy and Kristin.  I was pretty damn surprised to see them, as they were i, but after we thought about it.. duh.  It's Digweed in Minneapolis for godsake.  It was good to see them again ^_^.  I think the last time i ran into them was at Sasha last time he was in Minneapolis (<a href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis">pics</a>).</p><p>Andy works for a cellphone company in the Minnetonka area developing those international chips for cell phones.  Which means he writes assembly all day long in the pursuit of happiness.  Since he works on international soft/hardware he gets to travel quite a bit..  His job has shipped him over to France and Austrailia.  Pretty soon, he's going over to Tokyo too.  All expenses paid, so it's not all bad ^_^.</p><p>So those little international chips that are in those new DoCoMo 'world' phones in Japan are developed back over here in Minneapolis ^_^.  That's pretty slick.</p><p>___</p><p>Anywho, the next huge event going on in Minneapolis looks to be Paul Van Dyk hitting Myth on May 10th.  I'd absolutely go to that, if it weren't on a Thursday..  But, going to Minneapolis affords many opportunities other than musical..  It might be worth a vacation day ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 300" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/300">300</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday, my roommates and i all had premiere tickets for the new action-packed Frank Miller comic-book adaptation, <em>300</em> in fitchburg's Imax theater.  300 is about 300 spartans against the invasion of the Persian empire.</p><p>Visually this movie is absolutely stunning.  Few movies have such a rich quality of picture that literally any screen shot is a vivid photo suitable for framing.  It does borrow some special effects from Sin City, where eyes and other light elements of silhouettes are illuminated..  Such as the Persian soldier's eyes as they crept over the hills.</p><p>300 is one of those movies where i have certain expectations coming into the film.  Ya know, i've seen trailers and heard about the story, and all this stuff.  I hype myself up, and when i exit the theaters.. i feel disappointed.  Like the movie totally missed the mark for me.  This is happened with a couple other movies, such as Matrix Reloaded and Scanner Darkly.</p><p>Afterwards, i get home... go to bed..  Throughout the night and the next day, i keep thinking about it more and more, and start appreciating the movie for what it is.. not what i thought or someone else thought it was supposed to be.  You can't judge some romance movie because it didn't have enough action, or comedy because it didn't have enough serious moments..  I don't really know what i was expecting 300 to be, but it stands on its own.</p><p>The movie is pretty much all action and sex and action.  Battles are waged constantly, and the battle scenes are brutally raw and bloody.  I don't think i've ever seen a movie with so much blood, yet not really consider it to be gore.  Blood flies everywhere during most scenes, but it is shed in such a violent and deliberate way..  The blood is almost a living form within the shots.</p><p>As a whole, much like the battle scenes, 300 is terrifically raw.  Half naked muscle man, stumping across the battle field, beating, and stabbing and thrusting spears into each other, yelling at the top of your lungs.  Not to mention other scenes, with naked women telling the future, and seducing the gimp, and being naked.</p><p>This movie screams Man.  It's almost as manly as ripping off your chest hair, or smashing your head into the hood of a car, or other manly feats as scene on that Snicker's superbowl commercial.  It makes you want to join in the action, and scream your head off..  "SPARTANS!" in all of your awesome glory.  Pick up a spear and join the fight.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to War of the Worlds" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/war-of-the-worlds">War of the Worlds</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday we watched one of my favorite movies..  <b>War of the Worlds</b>.  Man i love this movie.  That 2005 Friday evening was a very magic evening.  Nature truly applauded the release with a lightning storm of its own.  That summer i went to the theaters a total of 3 times to see it.  Later on, i downloaded it from the internet and watched it quite a bit more.</p><p>I hadn't seen it in a while, so i needed my fix.  War of the Worlds falls into the same category as other great films like Matrix Reloaded, where the movie itself is very shallow.  It won't win any awards, but there are many aspects of the movie that are rich in substance.</p><p>I really seem to like these movies.  They appeal to my manic adrenaline side, but still offer more than that outside of the film.  I think that's why i don't really like Crank all that much.  There's really nothing there..</p><p>One of the things i noticed about War of the Worlds were the death machine designs compared to the alien design.  The aliens themselves, are 3 legged creatures with 3 fingers on each hand.  They can also walk on walls, which suggests the tip of their fingers have suction cups or something like that.  Their torso's are quite small compared to their leg span.  They have tiny little arms, and their heads fan out kinda like a spoiler.</p><p>The death machines can be described in the exact same way.  3-legged machines with tiny bodies.  Small little arm instruments on that body with a fanned out head..  So these alien death machines are actually alien mecha, machines built in their creator's own image.  Much like how anime such as Gundam model their massive machine after the human body.  It interesting to see a alien race so bent on vengence and rage would adopt one of our most arrogant traits.  It's quite... human.</p><p>When i was in Japan, #five and i got onto this subject somehow and he was telling me about an article some guy wrote about the movie.  It dealt with the time periods in which these movies were made.  For the original War of the Worlds books and movies, it was always about the aliens coming to air.  Flying their air ships from the sky, and zapping all the humans.  All those remakes came at a time when war was waged between countries.  The threat was always external.  Fear of invasion.</p><p>In the new War of the Worlds, the aliens were always here.  Underneath us..  biding their time.  They didn't come from the outside.  This parallels the wars that are waged today.  The war with terrorism.  The threat isn't external: it is internal.</p><p>This really makes the 2005 War of the Worlds an <em>adaption</em>, not a remake. ^_^</p><p>____</p><p>Anywho, this movie is all manor of kick ass, so if you haven't seen it you must.  I was rather surprised that one of my roommates hadn't even heard of it..  That was actually the real reason behind watching it.</p><p>A while ago, i developed the War of the Worlds drinking game which is both simple and works quite well.  All you have to do is take a drink when:</p><p>1) Someone asks an unanswered question.</p><p>That's it.  It worked quite well on Niehaus the first night he decided to drink.  I've got pictures hidden around this site if you're interested ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Crank" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crank">Crank</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>yesterday, i finally got the privilege of watching one of the fall lineups grandest movies: <b>Crank</b>.  Crank stars action-star Jason Statham as a double-crossed hitman.  He's been poisoned and must keep his adrenaline up, or else his heart stops.  The first time i heard of such a movie i thought it was one of the greatest movie concepts i had ever heard.  Over-the-top Action after over-the-top action after over-the-top action.</p><p>And that's exactly what this movie is.  Statham just beats the shit out of so many people, it's ridiculous.  Almost every scene he is in has some element of violence or drugs which fuels the over all adrenaline rush of the movie.  There's a few scenes where he's going through the hospital looking for epinephrine, and randomly pushing over patients for no reason..</p><p>This movie has a sense of humor in that way, but it also knows when it's being retarded.  The first action sequence of the movie features Statham driving through a mall, which is COMPLETE RIPOFF of Blues Brothers, which we just so happened to watch the other day.  The writers knew they were ripping it off, and made sure the audience knew this by adding in the line from Statham, "there sure are a lot shops in this mall."</p><p>It's also rather funny how there is no sense of boundaries at all.  Statham does drug after drug after drug, steals police cars, breaks things.  It's like they put everything bad that some irrate mother would complain about, they put it in and flaunted it.  It's kinda like Grand Theft Auto the movie, but not a movie about the story of GTA, just when you go around killing people and stealing cars for no reason.</p><p>This movie has everything i could've hoped for, but i find difficulty liking it.  It's so fricken Spike TV...  but that's what makes the movie so kickass.  Action, Action, Action for those with no attention span.  this attitude lends itself so well to the movie, since the main characters can't stop at all to figure out what's going on.  He's gotta get revenge before he dies, and if he stops....  Game Over.</p><p>The movie also has no shame when it comes to product placement. Need Adrenaline? Red Bull, Rockstar, and plenty other energy drinks and in there.  You could also say Cocaine, Pot and Nasal Spray fall under the category of product placement too.</p><p>Anywho... i suppose if you haven't seen Crank, you should definately give it a go.  Especially if you think over-the-top action movies are hilarious because the movie does go out of its way several times for a gimmick.  But as for owning it?..  eh..  maybe for the purposes of showing it to others.</p><p>Unfortunately i haven't seen either Transporter movies, so i can't really compare it to those.  For some reason, i have the feeling they are pretty similar to this.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Erebus' first show @ The Clinic, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show">Erebus' first show @ The Clinic, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Their music was quite amazing, but their lyrics seemed rather simple.  Their were like any country song or 90s pop song.  verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental, chorus.  oh well.. it was a family event type thing, so the whole drunken irish thing didn't quite take off.</p><p>But, wholey, i was inspired.  The crowd was pumped, and my friends were in awe.  I missed that feeling.  The feeling of enjoying the music to its full extent that you feel it throughout your body.  That same feeling everyone feels in the club that builds an immense vibe.  I felt like everyone at gaelic storm had that feeling except for me.  I felt that vibe at the concert, but it wasn't my vibe.</p><p>As soon as i returned from racine, i hopped on the internet in search of outlets.  I wanted to reclaim that feeling that i once had with my music.  i found quite a bit of things scattered throughout the weekends in madison.</p><p>Richard Devine was going to be at Inferno on friday and this was exactly what i wanted and he did not disappoint.</p><p>i was expected some pure techno beats coming from those speakers, but the man is a technical artist.  he tore up every track he played.  amazing.  i'm surprised my ears aren't still ringing.</p><p>also amazing was dj espe who headlined.  i arrived well into his amazing electro set.</p><p>inferno has certainly pulled itself together from what i remember of it back in the day.  maybe i just missed the good nights or something.  even though the place only had about 200 or 300 people, the vibe was definately there and some organization is present.</p><p>this coming weekend Nosmo formerly of Grayarea will descend on madcity along with Phil of eccentric beats headlining.  i remember seeing that guy all the time in minneapolis ^_^.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to V for Vendetta" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/v-for-vendetta">V for Vendetta</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Film classes need to put down there pencils and pile into the theaters right this very moment in order to learn and feel what it is to make a movie.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers have done it again.</p><p>I think we have ourselves a movie of the year here. Is there any of other movie that could really compare to the magnitude of V for Vendetta. This movie is beyond powerful. It's as if the Wachowski Brothers harnessed pure energy at a neutronic level and simply shaped it into film.</p><p>is it possible for the Wachowski Brothers to actually make a bad movie? i mean, really? It's like asking if an Italian could make a bad pizza.</p><p>People need to give these guys more money because they honestly deserve it. I just emailed them my bank account numbers. You should too!</p><div class='title'><b>V for Violence</b></div><p>This is where the film clearly shines as the main character using his Matrix style moves to kill people. Slow motion is used to detail the knives as the glisfully float through the air into their victims.</p><p>It's a form of art really.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers must have some sort of extra sensory vision in order to visualize the impact of each individual knife and then clearly transfer this thought process into film.</p><p>It's like the Wachowski Brothers are god except there are two of them. Oh man, what if they really were god. Who knows how are universe would have been shaped and created if the Wachowski Brothers made it. Two half gods are better than one?</p><div class='title'><b>V for.. Five?</b></div><p>V is not actually for Vendetta, it's for the roman numeral Five. He named himself this as his was in the fifth room of this detention facility. #Five you have a kindred spirit.</p><p>beyond that, five is a very powerful number. It's the third smallest prime number. It's the only prime number to end in the digit 5. It takes place in the fibonacci sequence.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of sides in a Pentagon. What could this mean? The whole movie is about government rule and such. Perhaps the Wachowski Brothers are trying to tell us something with our own government in this movie.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of points in a Star and 5 Stars refers to the rating system most movies are judged upon.</p><div class='title'><b>V for Victory</b></div><p>This film is positively amazing and i would see it over and over again if i had the time.</p><p>19 1/2 thumbs up.  all the way.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Harry Potter #6" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/harry-potter-6">Harry Potter #6</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I got to Batman Begins somehow, and from there went to Christian Bale to check out his movies.  Besides the movie listing, there was a picture of him from the movie Equilibrium, a movie that i have never heard of, so i checked it out.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" /></p><p>The description compared it to the Matrix and Brave New World, says that it was a futuristic thriller where society is the enemy.  This sounded pretty good, so i went out to Best Buy and picked up a copy.</p><p>Bad Move.</p><p>While Equilibrium sounds pretty good on the surface, i was quite disappointed with the results.  All the promo's on the DVD jacket stated that it's gun fighting techniques were top-notch, however in execution, the were too over-the-top, set to horrible background music, and just looked goofy.  This movie prides itself on it's gun fighting, but there's not enough of it, and it's awkward in execution.</p><p>The story of Equilibrium is set in the future, when society has developed a drug to supress emotions in humans, since emotions are what triggers conflict, war, etc.  Society has a team of police that hunt down anyone not taking the drug, and they also destroy anything that has to do with emotion.  The future is completely black and white.  Sounds pretty pretentious.</p><p>What was really disappointing was the acting.  or perhaps it was acted so well, that Christian Bale perfectly executed the dull process of a emotion-less tool into a senseful human.  Christian Bale himself is pretty emotionless in his acting in the first place..  perhaps he wasn't the best choice.</p><p>Christian Bale is an interesting fellow, though.  I hardly EVER hear about him at all, yet he has a little cult following known as Bale-heads.  He's extremely buff yet acts in B movies, aside from Batman Begins.  American Psycho was the only other movie i remember him being in that i have actually seen, and ever then i didn't ever know his name.</p><p>anyways..  the story was par, i'd say.  there were too many plot twists at the end that made it unbelievable, not that the story wasn't pretty far-fetched in the first place.</p><p>I really should have rented this movie if i wanted to see it..  oops.  It puzzled me why there wasn't a copy at any of the used movie stores i went to, and i have come to the conclusion that no one bought the movie in the first place..  They must have rented it instead.</p><p>Though i still kinda like Christian Bale, i think i'll check out <b>The Machinist</b> next.  apparently, in preparation for the movie he lost 63 pounds to fit the role, and then after shooting he gained it back for the Buffed up Bruce Wayne.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anime Video Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anime-video-games">Anime Video Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 28, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><div class='title'><b><u>Sword of Berserk</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>Sword of Berserk was actually my first exposure to Berserk. i remember hearing about how violent the game was, so i picked it up one day at work to check it out. (at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/15">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/13">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
