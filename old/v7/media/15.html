Their music was quite amazing, but their lyrics seemed rather simple.  Their were like any country song or 90s pop song.  verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental, chorus.  oh well.. it was a family event type thing, so the whole drunken irish thing didn't quite take off.</p><p>But, wholey, i was inspired.  The crowd was pumped, and my friends were in awe.  I missed that feeling.  The feeling of enjoying the music to its full extent that you feel it throughout your body.  That same feeling everyone feels in the club that builds an immense vibe.  I felt like everyone at gaelic storm had that feeling except for me.  I felt that vibe at the concert, but it wasn't my vibe.</p><p>As soon as i returned from racine, i hopped on the internet in search of outlets.  I wanted to reclaim that feeling that i once had with my music.  i found quite a bit of things scattered throughout the weekends in madison.</p><p>Richard Devine was going to be at Inferno on friday and this was exactly what i wanted and he did not disappoint.</p><p>i was expected some pure techno beats coming from those speakers, but the man is a technical artist.  he tore up every track he played.  amazing.  i'm surprised my ears aren't still ringing.</p><p>also amazing was dj espe who headlined.  i arrived well into his amazing electro set.</p><p>inferno has certainly pulled itself together from what i remember of it back in the day.  maybe i just missed the good nights or something.  even though the place only had about 200 or 300 people, the vibe was definately there and some organization is present.</p><p>this coming weekend Nosmo formerly of Grayarea will descend on madcity along with Phil of eccentric beats headlining.  i remember seeing that guy all the time in minneapolis ^_^.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to V for Vendetta" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/v-for-vendetta">V for Vendetta</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Film classes need to put down there pencils and pile into the theaters right this very moment in order to learn and feel what it is to make a movie.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers have done it again.</p><p>I think we have ourselves a movie of the year here. Is there any of other movie that could really compare to the magnitude of V for Vendetta. This movie is beyond powerful. It's as if the Wachowski Brothers harnessed pure energy at a neutronic level and simply shaped it into film.</p><p>is it possible for the Wachowski Brothers to actually make a bad movie? i mean, really? It's like asking if an Italian could make a bad pizza.</p><p>People need to give these guys more money because they honestly deserve it. I just emailed them my bank account numbers. You should too!</p><div class='title'><b>V for Violence</b></div><p>This is where the film clearly shines as the main character using his Matrix style moves to kill people. Slow motion is used to detail the knives as the glisfully float through the air into their victims.</p><p>It's a form of art really.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers must have some sort of extra sensory vision in order to visualize the impact of each individual knife and then clearly transfer this thought process into film.</p><p>It's like the Wachowski Brothers are god except there are two of them. Oh man, what if they really were god. Who knows how are universe would have been shaped and created if the Wachowski Brothers made it. Two half gods are better than one?</p><div class='title'><b>V for.. Five?</b></div><p>V is not actually for Vendetta, it's for the roman numeral Five. He named himself this as his was in the fifth room of this detention facility. #Five you have a kindred spirit.</p><p>beyond that, five is a very powerful number. It's the third smallest prime number. It's the only prime number to end in the digit 5. It takes place in the fibonacci sequence.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of sides in a Pentagon. What could this mean? The whole movie is about government rule and such. Perhaps the Wachowski Brothers are trying to tell us something with our own government in this movie.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of points in a Star and 5 Stars refers to the rating system most movies are judged upon.</p><div class='title'><b>V for Victory</b></div><p>This film is positively amazing and i would see it over and over again if i had the time.</p><p>19 1/2 thumbs up.  all the way.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Harry Potter #6" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/harry-potter-6">Harry Potter #6</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I got to Batman Begins somehow, and from there went to Christian Bale to check out his movies.  Besides the movie listing, there was a picture of him from the movie Equilibrium, a movie that i have never heard of, so i checked it out.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" /></p><p>The description compared it to the Matrix and Brave New World, says that it was a futuristic thriller where society is the enemy.  This sounded pretty good, so i went out to Best Buy and picked up a copy.</p><p>Bad Move.</p><p>While Equilibrium sounds pretty good on the surface, i was quite disappointed with the results.  All the promo's on the DVD jacket stated that it's gun fighting techniques were top-notch, however in execution, the were too over-the-top, set to horrible background music, and just looked goofy.  This movie prides itself on it's gun fighting, but there's not enough of it, and it's awkward in execution.</p><p>The story of Equilibrium is set in the future, when society has developed a drug to supress emotions in humans, since emotions are what triggers conflict, war, etc.  Society has a team of police that hunt down anyone not taking the drug, and they also destroy anything that has to do with emotion.  The future is completely black and white.  Sounds pretty pretentious.</p><p>What was really disappointing was the acting.  or perhaps it was acted so well, that Christian Bale perfectly executed the dull process of a emotion-less tool into a senseful human.  Christian Bale himself is pretty emotionless in his acting in the first place..  perhaps he wasn't the best choice.</p><p>Christian Bale is an interesting fellow, though.  I hardly EVER hear about him at all, yet he has a little cult following known as Bale-heads.  He's extremely buff yet acts in B movies, aside from Batman Begins.  American Psycho was the only other movie i remember him being in that i have actually seen, and ever then i didn't ever know his name.</p><p>anyways..  the story was par, i'd say.  there were too many plot twists at the end that made it unbelievable, not that the story wasn't pretty far-fetched in the first place.</p><p>I really should have rented this movie if i wanted to see it..  oops.  It puzzled me why there wasn't a copy at any of the used movie stores i went to, and i have come to the conclusion that no one bought the movie in the first place..  They must have rented it instead.</p><p>Though i still kinda like Christian Bale, i think i'll check out <b>The Machinist</b> next.  apparently, in preparation for the movie he lost 63 pounds to fit the role, and then after shooting he gained it back for the Buffed up Bruce Wayne.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Akira Capsule Figures" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/akira-capsule-figures">Akira Capsule Figures</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Here are the Series 2 figures, which i got today:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">Lady Miyako<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">Tetsuo (Early Chapter 6)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">Kaneda (Sitting)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">Kei (Alley Scene)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">Tetsuo (End of Chapter 3)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I love those last two figures, especially Tetsuo.

Amazing detail packed into such a tiny package. You don't really notice from the pictures, but none of these figures exceed 3 inches. I think that Tetsuo Chapter 3 figure is the longest.</p><p>I loved these figures from the start, but I only recently found out that Master Japanese Figure Company Kaiyodo is partially behind these beautiful figures. When it comes to anime figures, you cannot go wrong. Check them out at <a href="http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/" title="http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/">http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/</a></p><p>Man, their figures are awesome. If they started doing Berserk figures... oh man, I'd be broke.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Soundbar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2">Sasha @ Soundbar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

(at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Escape, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis">Sasha @ Escape, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Escape was a newly opened club in Minneapolis that is currently no longer in operation.  It was in the same building as Game Works, which was pretty odd.  Next to the arcade, bowling alley, and movie theater, oh!  was a night club.  Why not?  It's all entertainment, right?</p><p>I don't really much of the event inside.  There was some girl hassling me because I was taking photos, and she thought I was taking photos of her.  pfft.  Outside, on my way back to the car, some bums were hassling me for money, and following me.  I should've taken the skyway.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made on March 22nd, 2014 and back-dated to the time of the event.</i><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/16">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/14">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
