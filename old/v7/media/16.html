| June 8, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hey guess what? I've actually been reading lately.  Reading BOOKS.  And not those berserk manga, which are pretty dumb by the way.  I've been reading more of Chuck Palahniuk's books.  Today, I finally finished Invisible Monsters, which i started back last year but got too bored with to finish.  blah blah..</p><p>Anyways, I need stuff to do during lunch at work, so since last year i started reading. I started with Palahniuk's most recent novel, at the time, Choke, which was quite fun and very Fight Club esq.  Then, I ventured to Survivor, which i liked a bit better.  It felt more epic, more adventurous.</p><p>After reading those two, I attempted Invisible Monsters, but I got quite bored of it, so I quit.  The rest of last summer I spent sleeping in my car during the lunch period.  Then during Christmas I played Sword of Mana during lunch, and then for Spring Break, I started reading Palahniuk's Lullaby.  I had bought it a while ago because it was hard to find.  I got about halfway through and after getting back to Minneapolis from college, I finished it, and now I've finished Invisible Monsters, too..  blah blah blah blah..</p><p>Anywho, I don't think I gave Choke the credit it deserved.  One thing i love about Chuck's books is that the narrator is the main character.  So, since the whole book is set up like the main character is writing about what happened, it stands to reason that the climax of the story is a huge change in the character's life.  It's not just something that happens, but something that happens to the main character.</p><p>I was trying to figure out why I thought Survivor was better than Choke, when Choke basically has the same recipe as Fight Club, and Fight Club works beautifully.  There's no epic adventure in Fight Club.  But really, what's so epic about Survivor?  The only real adventure is them returning home.  Reading Lullaby and Invisible Monsters, the characters travel around in those books.  True in those two books, they don't have an exact meaningful destination, but it's set up and written the same.  Plus once branson reaches his destination in Survivor, he changes, but thats not <u>the</u> climax of the book.  It's a climax, but not the climax.  Survivor is pretty matted though.  The character's in Choke have their own style and are more bizarre than you'd think they'd be.  In Survivor, i guess you could say, the character's are a little more normal.</p><p>Choke is pretty schway though.  I'm really interested to see the movie adpatation.  I read they begin fliming it this fall.  I should probably read it again, and familiarize myself.  Once i finish reading Fight Club and Diary, i'll need something to do, anyways.</p><p>I love Lullaby, though.  I guess you could say it has an epic journey, but also has a couple character stories that move along the story quite well.  The whole theme of dark magic kept me interested and reading, unlike Invisible Monsters, where the theme was beauty and modeling and regular 'ol sex, which isn't that moving.  It was distracting me from the story ^_^.  Invisible Monsters ended quite well, but i couldn't pay attention to the climaxing story.  It was hard to keep track of the point in time as well because the flashback bounced around too much.  Also, characters in Invisible Monsters didn't really have any strong mental illnesses, there were more physical ailiments than mental.</p><p>Last year, I made a little chart filling in the ingredients to Chuck's recipe.  So, it's time to fill in the chart with the two books I've entered into my head.</p><table width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0"><tr align="center"><td style="width: 100px"></td><td style="width: 100px">Choke</td><td style="width: 100px">Survivor</td><td style="width: 100px">Fight Club .mov</td><td style="width: 100px">Lullaby</td><td style="width: 100px">Invisible Monsters</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px">Main Character</td><td style="width: 100px">Victor Mancinni</td><td style="width: 100px">Tender Branson</td><td style="width: 100px">-spoiler-</td><td style="width: 100px">Carl Streator</td><td style="width: 100px">various</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px">Illness</td><td style="width: 100px">sex-aholic</td><td style="width: 100px">born into cult</td><td style="width: 100px">insomnia</td><td style="width: 100px">--</td><td style="width: 100px">jaw shot off</td></tr><tr></tr></table><br/><b>to be continued</b><p><u>Lullaby Exerpt & Quotes</u></p><p><i>To justify any crime, you have to make the victim your enemy. ..

How God would spare the city if there was even one good person still in it.  Here's just the opposite.

We hate to give up those reins of our culture.  To find our own music playing in elevators.  The ballad for our revolution, turned into background music for a television commercial.  To find our generation's clothes and hair suddently retro</i> (page 160)</p><p><i>I say how maybe God didn't start out by attacking and berating everybody who prayed.  I say, maybe it was after years and years of getting the same prayers about unwanted pregnancies, about divorces, about family squabbles.  Maybe it was because God's audience grew and more people were making demands.  Maybe it was the more praise He got.

Maybe you go to hell for the things you don't do</i> (page 175)</p><p><i>In any salughterhouse operation, the trick is to fool cows into climbing the chute that leads to the killing floor.  Cows trucked in from farms, they're confused, scared.  After hours or days squeezed into trucks, dehydrated and awake the whole trip, the cows are thrown in with other cows in the feedlot outside the slaughterhouse.</i><br/><i>How you get them to climb the chute is you send in the Judas Cow.  This is really what this cow is called.  It's a cow that lives at the slaughterhouse.  It minges with the doomed cows, then leads them up the chute to the killing floor.  The scared, spooked cows would never go except for the Judas Cow leading the way.</i><br/><i>The last step before the ax or the knife or the steel bolt through the skull, at that last moment, the Judas Cow steps aside.  It survives to lead another herd to their death.  It does this for its entire life.</i> (page 192)</p><p><i>The best way to waste your life is by taking notes.

| June 7, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I've gotten current with One Piece and it seems like ever since they've made it to the Grand Line, the amount of characters who have consumed Devil's Fruit has risen much more than before.  Almost every person, friend or enemy, has a power. So, to keep 'em all straight I thought it'd keep track of all the Devil's Fruit that have been uncovered in the story line in order of appearance, for the most part.</p><p>I put all these details on <a href="/pages/one_piece.html" title="/pages/one_piece.html">this page</a>.</p><p>Luffy's fruit was uncovered in the first episode. And a couple episodes later, the next fruit was uncovered.  The next episode that mentions a different fruit is episode 49 when Alvida returns.  The first 50 episodes of the series has only 3 fruit. Then, the next 50 episodes have 11 fruit.  There were about 2 or 3 per story arc. </p><p>Speaking of story arcs, I made a list of those as well so when we show One Piece at SPAMM on the weekends, we could show the episodes of story arcs, rather than just a set number of episodes per week.</p><p>Episodes 1 : Luffy Intro<br/>Episodes 2 - 3 : Zoro Intro<br/>Episodes 4 - 8 : Captain Buggy<br/>Episodes 9 - 17 : Ussop Story<br/>Episodes 18 - 19 : Luffy & Zoro Story<br/>Episodes 20 - 30 : Sanji Story<br/>Episodes 31 - 44: Nami Story<br/>Episodes 45 - 53 : Buggy & Rogue Town<br/>Movie 2 : The Clockwork Island Adventure<br/>Episodes 54 - 61 : Apis & Dragon's Nest<br/>Episodes 62 - 63 : Laboon & Vivi Intro<br/>Episodes 64 - 67 : Whiskey Peak<br/>Episodes 68 - 69 : Coby Story<br/>Episodes 70 - 78 : Little Garden<br/>Episodes 79 - 91 : Chopper Story & Drum Kingdom<br/>Episodes 92 - ?? : Vivi & Alabasta<br/>Movie 3 : Rare Monster Island, Chopper's Kingdom</p><p>We'd really only be able to get through a certain amount of episodes each week.  And, by the looks of things, we'll probably need to cut in the middle of some of the story arcs, too.</p><p>Looks like the longest story arc in One Piece is 12 episodes long, and the average looks to be around 9 or 10. This is unlike Dragonball Z whose story arcs round out around 30 with main story arcs of 100 episodes.  One Piece has an overall story goal, but the story arcs round out well enough.</p><p>Ya know, the beginning of One Piece was quite fun and the fun continues on through the point they make it to the Grand Line (episode 61). But after that, the whole caliber of the series begins to drop. Before, the fights were more serious and had more emotion. Now it's become a joke. There hasn't been any contest at all. Luffy easily kicks their asses. No suspense, thats it. Hopefully when they fight Crocodile the 'intensity' will return.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dave Seaman, &quot;Plush&quot; @ Tabu, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dave-seaman-tabu-minneapolis">Dave Seaman, "Plush" @ Tabu, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This was the first time I had seen these wonderful musicians.</p><p>I had listened to Gabriel & Dresden's mixes online continuously since the previous summer when I first heard them.  Their mixes were wonderfully layered complex and beautiful.  Josh Gabriel was one of the first DJ to go completely digital with his music.  He ran his part of the night from his laptop using Abelton.</p><p>They played all their amazing tracks.  It was very similar to any of the mixes of their you can find around that time.  Excellent excellent.  James Holden opened for these guys, and it was equally spectacular.</p><p>Additionally, before the event, Trance Addict was hosting a meet-n-greet with a bunch of their members, and Gabriel & Dresden themselves at a local bar.  It was probably one of the most awkward experiences for them.  There were only 5 of us, and we were pretty nerdy and socially awkward.  Gabriel & Dresden talked about their motivations as artists, and how they DJ.</p><p>You can read my original thoughts of the event, but they are incredbily poorly written: <a href="/old/v7/chi-town" title="/chi-town">February 29th, 2004</a></p><p><i>Note: This post was made on March 22nd, 2014 and back-dated to the time of the event.</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hybrid @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hybrid">Hybrid @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Friday night was one of the best club experiences yet, right up there with Sasha, BT, Paul van Dyk and The Crystal Method.  It was simply amazing. ah.. it was a dream come true hearing Symphony live just as it was hearing Sasha play Xpander live. I think now because those 2 dreams have been met my electronic past has been satisfied. Its kinda sad that i have such a small past, but that was basically it: Sasha + Hybrid.</p><p>And not only was experiencing their music a dream come true, but they are very conversational with their fan. Afterward, they were in the back on the club signing stuff.  I got my new Morning Scifi CD signed as well as some Hybrid plate mats ^_^. Stu got his synth signed by Hybrid. Very nice! Mike Truman and Adam Taylor are real nice guys ^_^.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/031114/hybrid_scifi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/031114/hybrid_scifi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/031114/hybrid_scifi.webp" /></p><p>Spending the night with Kristina and Stu at The Fine Line was much more fun than being there alone.  Before hybrid graced the stage, we sat down near the floor making fun of Mason T's extremely predictable tribal/house set. ick.. It was a slow start for such a great night.</p><p>After hybrid, one of the Dubpistols got up there and played some nice songs. Though, it was a backdrop to us waiting in line for signatures.  The guy played the always fun 'Smells like Freeland' by Nirvana. I hadn't heard that song in a while ^_^</p><p>It was great the entire night.  And afterward, outside the club, there was a huge brawl.  Black women beating the shit out of each other.  The cops came and put a quick stop to that. They gassed everyone around the car, and everyone ran the hell away from there coughing and heaving. it was neat ^_^   Street crime!! I did not take photos, though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ferry Corsten @ The Quest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ferry-corsten-the-quest">Ferry Corsten @ The Quest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They had the red leather chairs on stage behind the decks, and a small table with black dialup phones on a dark maroon cloth.  Phenix M was dressed as Neo working the decks up until DJ Rap.  Jack Trash and that other guy dressed as the twins.  Josh Grub, the photographer, and other 'roadies' dressed as an agents, and either I think Jack Trash's wife or Phenix M's girl dressed as Trinity.</p><p>They also had a contest the entire night.  When you entered you were given a key, and if your key open the box in the back, you'd win what was inside. I later found out that inside were VIP passes to every SIM event from that day on, some cds, shirts, and other stuff.  I also later found out that no one won the prize, hehe.</p><p>A few times during Phenix M's set, a dressed up person would come up, pick up the phone and then retreat back to backstage. The end of Phenix M's set happened when Jack Trash and the other guy, dressed as the Twins came out and grabbed Phenix M, dressed as Neo, drug him off the stage and beat him up. ^_^  hilarious.</p><p>Phenix M's set overall just blew me away, "it was exactly what i needed to hear" as far as curing all this ending semester "needing to write research papers" stress. ^_^  As mentioned earlier, DJ Rap surprisingly played Breaks instead of her usual Drum & Bass.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, actually, almost enough to perhaps sample her newest CD with a Breaks set on it.  At the end of her set, she spun her newest remix: a Drum & Bass remix of Tainted Love by Soft Cell, at least I think thats the song.</p><p>Ferry Corsten spun an excellent set. Though, I only recognized the songs he wrote. The crowd went NUTS over Punk. They chanted along with the beats to the song just the same as on that cd. The crowd also went nuts over his new single he played, Rock my Body Rock.  Very great music, and The Quest was quite packed as well. Still, I don't think it'll ever be as packed as it was for Delta Heavy. ^_^</p><p>An excellent night.  I only took a few pictures though because I really wasn't in a photography mood, and the pictures I did take all came out horrid. Though, Josh Grub's pics I'm sure will be illustration enough of the Matrix themed night. ^_^  He'll post them on mnvibe.com.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sandra Collins @ The Quest, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sandra-collins-the-quest">Sandra Collins @ The Quest, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 1, 2003 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight, I saw <b>Voices of a Distant Star</b>, a single episode OAV that Jason recommended. I decided to show a portion of it during SPAMM social hour tonight, too.</p><p>I did indeed like it quite a bit. Voices shows the struggle of a loving couple through their ever growing distant relationship. Mikako (I think that's the girl's name) is in the space military which is traveling to the ends of our galaxy fighting off some alien race. Noboru, the guy, is on Earth.</p><p>The entire 30-minute OAV encompasses their entire relationship. From the begining as they fall in love in middle school, she is then shipped off to space to fight these aliens because she's an elite pilot or something. They keep in contact through phone mail, and as the military edges closer to the ends of our galaxy, the response time between mail grows from days to months to a year. And then, as the space fleet warps off to the opposing alien galaxy, the response time grows to 8.6 years.</p><p>On Earth, Noboru deals with his love for Mikako and the wait. He wonders about his role as a lover and his role in his own life. At age 15, Mikako sends him a mail as the war begins and ends on the alien home world, 8.6 light years away.  At age 24, Noboru is a distant person. He has kept his away from most social attachments, in the back of his mind waiting for Mikako's words, but also being realistic to himself and taking up his life in the military as well.</p><p>As he leaves for his life in the military, he receives the mail from Mikako, which is basically just a hello, along with audio from her fighting the alien race, and thinking outloud about love and life, and then her victory on the alien world. Noboru smiles and agrees...  and then the episode is over.</p><p>Earlier, I thought that it would have ended better with her dying in space, leaving Noboru with the immortal words of her love. But now, I think I realize her life a little better. It wouldn't matter whether she was alive or dead. Noboru already accepts the fact that he will probably never see her again. And he also accepts the fact that she is the only for him. She means so much to him that no other social attachments matter. In his mind, she'll never disappear.</p><p>If she died, he wouldn't detach himself anymore than he already has, nor would he in his life to come. All his joy belongs to her and without her the joy is gone. Though, even if she returned some day to him. His joy would never return to what they had as children.</p><p>In the end, their joy depletes equally with each other, so if they were to meet and live together again,  they'd understand each other's pain. They'd know and they would be fine with that, even if they couldn't see each other smile on the outside. Their hearts would brighten if even the slightest, and then continue to warm for the rest of their lives.</p><p>The concept of cheating life with light speed travel, and then the social relationships that are ripped and stretched because of it, is something that really grabbed my interest in the classic Gainax series Gunbuster. After the main character finishes high school, she is sent in some mission playing around with light speed. Then as she returns to earth, she is still 18, but 10 or 20 years have passed since that date. All of her friends have grown up, married with kids. She finds one of her high school friends, and they chat and catch up.</p><p>It's interesting. Her friend would probably feel nostalgic, but at the same time envious. She is older. She has aged. Yet, it seems as if her friend, the main character, almost gets a second chance at life. A second chance that she can't experience.</p><p>Anyways, I've found that pure long distance relationships do end up taking away a lot of external emotions. When you speak to them through AIM or email, your emotions are expressed internally as you think of what to write. You become more introverted. You can't do any social activities with them, so you spend your time communicating, rather than "living."</p><p>or perhaps this happens to people who truly seriously pour all their emotions into their relationship because it means so much to them.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/17">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/15">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
