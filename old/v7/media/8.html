Thankfully, there wasn't a horrible ice storm of death, like last time.  It was actually really nice outside for a mid-October evening.</p><p>I'm not particularly a fan of Jonathon Coulton but I've actually seen him in concert a lot, which is somewhat weird.  I've seen him 6 times in the past 2 years.  Though, 3 of those were out of convenience of him performing at PAX.</p><p>Every time he comes through Madison, I buy a ticket and I wonder why.  I don't really like his music style and the crowd is usually packed with people that are WAY too into his music.  But, I still buy a ticket and attend the show.  And every time I'm glad that I did because I actually do enjoy myself.  It's pretty fun, and the show feels pretty unique, even though it's the same thing.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul &amp; Storm</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp"  /></p><p>Paul &amp; Storm have traditionally performed that exact same material every time I've seen them open for Coulton.  They start with Opening Band.  They sing the Nun song, the music tributes (the musician in this situation), the 15 second commercials, and end with Pirates.</p><p>Tonight, they actually performed new material and they didn't rely on the same formula of their past performances.  Here's their set list, which is a little out of order, and probably missing a song or two.</p><p>Paul and Storm - Theme Song<br/>The Way-Too-Early Christmas Song<br/>Frogger! The Frogger Musical<br/>Nun Fight<br/>Live<br/>Nugget Man<br/>If James Taylor were on Fire<br/>If Aaron Neville Were Waiting for a Parking Spot at the Mall, but Someone else Snagged it<br/>If They Might Be Giants were the Ice Cream Man<br/>Opening Band<br/>The Captain's Wife's Lament</p><p>Their Frogger song was pretty funny.  Starting off with new material gave their set of a fresh view for people that have seen them a couple times already.  When they sang their old stuff towards the end, it felt they were returning to the classics, rather than the same shit they sing every time.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp"  /></p><p>Like usual, the crowd couldn't stop yelling out random nonsense.  There was this girl behind us that couldn't help but yell in our ears as loud as she could.  There was some dude in the balcony that had a gasping, yelping laugh that was infectious at first, but annoying as shit after it continued for almost a minute straight.</p><p>Though, Paul &amp; Storm really feed off this crazy crowd.  They'll continue to respond to the random yelling and usually retort and continue the tangential cycle that keeps them from singing anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathon Coulton</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp"  /></p><p>Not too long after Paul &amp; Storm finished their set, Jonathon Coulton took the stage and immediately began his set, which is as follows...</p><p>1. ????<br/>2. Ikea<br/>3. Shop Vac<br/>4. Code Monkey<br/>5. I'm your Moon<br/>6. Curl<br/>7. Space Doggity<br/>8. "Dead" -They Might Be Giants<br/>9, Big Bad World One<br/>10. Creepy Doll<br/>11. Mr. Fancy Pants<br/>12. Drinking with You<br/>13. The Future Soon<br/>14. Skullcrusher Mountain<br/>15. Still Alive<br/>16. Mandelbrot Set<br/>17. You Ruined Everything<br/>18. Your Brains</p><p>1. A Talk with George<br/>2. First of May</p><p>Coulton certainly acts more mature than Paul &amp; Storm, so it felt rather awkward when the crowd would yell out random crap.  I guess Coulton didn't really care, but most of the nonsense he just ignored or attempted to cull.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp"  /></p><p>As I mentioned a few times, I'm not that big a fan of Coulton.  I've seen him 6 times live, but I've never actually listened to any of his music outside of a concert.  I've only heard the acoustic versions of anything he's done, except for Still Alive.  And every time he performs a song I've heard before, it's mostly identical to what I've heard before.</p><p>When I saw Moby perform earlier this year, his set was full of songs from his entire body of work, but each one was played in a new style, or brought something new to the table.  The concert was completely unique as it wasn't just a Live version of the song, but it was the 2009 Live version of the song.  Adding Paul &amp; Storm as background singers and percussion was a great addition, but maybe Coulton should bring something else or something more to his concerts to diversify.</p><p>It's great if you've never heard him before, but his past 3 performances in Madison are nearly identical.  I guess if you're a huge fan, you probably just want to hear the "classics" rather than some experimental evolution of his "classics".  I feel his songs have gone beyond the initial chuckle from the lyrics, and after that all you have is the underlying music, which I think is pretty standard.</p><p>He needs more experimental songs like Mr. Fancy Pants..</p><div class='title'><b>Coulton USB thingy</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp"  /></p><p>I mentioned that I've never bought or listened to any of Coulton's music before.  Well... that changed last night, as I purchased this Jonathon Coulton USB stick.  It's 2 gigs and contains ALL of his music, as well as, album art and source material for all the tracks of JoCo Looks Back (which is a CD of all his popular songs).  It was $50, which might seem like a lot, but, again, has all 9 or 10 CDs of his plus stuff he's posted on his blog.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.0 in English!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-10-in-english">Evangelion 1.0 in English!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 25, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>It's been 2 years since Evangelion 1.0 premiered in Japanese theaters.  In September 2007, Gainax and Studio Khara released the 1st of the Rebuild of Evangelion quadrilogy.  North American licensing will still up in the air, at this point.  Many Anime fans wondered if ADV could pick up the rights?  Perhaps Manga entertainment would paid a shitload of money for the previous movies?</p><div class='title'><b>When?</b></div><p>Over a year had passed after its theatrical release and STILL no American Anime company had bought the rights..  It had already been out on DVD in Japan since April, and there were no signs it was even coming to America until Funimation (of all Anime companies) issued a cease and desist order to fansubbers in November 2008.  It wasn't until December 31st, 2008 that they official stated they had the domestic rights.</p><p>One day in March 2009, with the anticipation of Evangelion 2.0, I finally decided to <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">download and watch Evangelion 1.0</a>.  <a href="/old/v7/rebuild-of-evangelion" title="/rebuild-of-evangelion" title="/rebuild-of-evangelion">And it was fantastic.</a> ^_^  In May 2009, <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone" title="/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone" title="/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">the Bluray</a> was finally released, and I bought it because I wanted to see the movie in absolute clarity.  Funimation, still dragging their feet, finally announced the voice cast around the same day the Bluray released in Japan.</p><p>In June 2009, Evangelion 2.0 was released in theaters and earned $5 million in 2 days showing on only 120 screens.  Each theater showing the movie earned about $40,000 for those 2 days. [<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen">link</a>]  It was so successful that Studio Khara now has a blank check for making the final 2 movies in the series. [<a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/">link</a>]  The marketing for Evangelion 2.0 was all over the place in Japan and it worked fantastically.</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 1.0 under-performing in America</b></div><p>Evangelion 2.0's success is a stark contrast to Funimation's handling of Evangelion 1.0.  Evangelion 1.0 has been complete since September, and they've been showing it in several theaters across the states, but it's doing terribly.  Their "theatrical" run has made a pathetic $100,000, so far. [<a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm" title="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm" title="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm">link</a>]</p><p>There could be other reasons why Evangelion is under performing in the states, though.  For me, Evangelion is my Star Wars.  It's a cultural icon of my past and has influenced that way I have viewed Anime since then.  I think many Japanese people feel the same way, which is why it's such a huge success over there.  The shared experience of a generation of Anime fans, reuniting with the new generation.</p><p>It doesn't garner the same mass fandom over here, because Evangelion was released when Anime was still quite niche in America.  The kids in the know and super fans definitely saw it and probably loved it.  The first time I saw the series all the way through, I was a fan for life.  But the only way to see it, was the buy the VHS tapes which sold for $30 each and had 2 episodes.  That's almost $400.  That's way too much for any high school kid to pay.  That's really why Anime clubs began..</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion in Chicago</b></div><p>Anyways, Evangelion 1.0 has finally come to America and more specific it's showing in Chicago this whole week at The Music Box. [<a href="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion" title="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion" title="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion">link</a>].

I wonder if their other theater is just as small as this one.  I doubt it could fit more than 200 people, and there were about 30 of us in there.  We were all Anime fans.  There were several people wearing Evangelion Tshirts too, which was pretty awesome. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>English Dubbed</b></div><p>I really had no idea if they were showing Evangelion with english subtitles or with the english dubbed track.  I don't know why, but I was actually surprised it was the English Dub.  I was actually pretty thankful because I had already watched the movie in Japanese at least a dozen times that this is actually something new!</p><p>Holy Shit!  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">The dub is hysterical.</span> Not just hysterical, but "font-weight: bold, font-size: 20px" hysterical.  <b>Funimation's Evangelion 1.0 puts Secret of Crystania to shame</b>.  In fact, there are several instances where there are DIRECT quotes from Crystania in Evangelion.  "If you're going to do it, do it now!", "You just don't get it, do you?" (Though, I guess those quotes are pretty generic.)  There were so many parts that were embarrassingly goofy, and I just couldn't stop but laugh.</p><p>If you thought Shinji was a whiny bitch in the original Dub of the series, Spike Spencer (the voice) brings it to a level you never thought possible.  It's so bad, there's no one that could possibly take it seriously.  You can't.  It's not serious.  It can't be serious.  His acting has got to be a ridiculous parody.</p><p>And it was fantastic that everyone in theater was on the same page.  I've never seen a movie where the audience was exactly in sync with the movie.  We laughed at the ridiculous acting.  We laughed at the parts that were supposed to be funny.  And were silent and polite when important stuff was going on.  It was like SPAMM, actually.</p><div class='title'><b>It's not that bad, though</b></div><p>Overall, the acting is pretty hilarious, but Allison Keith does a fantastic job with Misato.  Actually, Brina Palencia is really good as Rei, too, but Misato stands out because she's the one character with the most distinct personality in the entire movie.  It's so strong that it really feels like Misato in the main character.  She's the Han Solo to Shinji's whiny Luke Skywalker.  Which would make Pen Pen Chewbacca... i guess.</p><p>Though, her acting is only accented by the rather well done English script.  There were really just two parts that seemed lost in translation.  Though, that could have been because it was acted poorly.  But really, everything else made perfect sense and flowed quite well.  They did a great job keeping the script original and better written than the original series.  The writers definitely didn't half-ass the script.  They left the half-assing to the voice acters.</p><p>Evangelion 1.0 really does stand on its own as a movie, but leaves several hints towards the quadrilogy as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>North American DVD Release!</b></div><p>On November 17th, 2009 (3 weeks from now), Evangelion 1.0 will finally be released on DVD in North America.  Unfortunately, the Bluray won't be released until Spring 2010. [<a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/">link</a>].  By then, Evangelion 2.0 should be out on Bluray in Japan.</p><p>They're following a similar release schedule for the original Japanese release.  The first DVD release was entitled Evangelion 1.01.  They cleaned up a couple areas of the film, but in general it was identical to the theatrical release.  Later on, with the Bluray release, it was Evangelion 1.11, which contains some new scenes in there somewhere.  They fixed a few more areas of the film, and added 3 minutes to the beginning.  It is the best-selling Bluray in Japan to date at 49,000 copies (one of which is mine!). [<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/1st-k-on-volume-is-now-no.2-blu-ray-in-japan-so-far" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/1st-k-on-volume-is-now-no.2-blu-ray-in-japan-so-far" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/1st-k-on-volume-is-now-no.2-blu-ray-in-japan-so-far">link</a>]</p><p>I'll continue to wait for the North American Bluray release.  If the DVDs underperform, hopefully they'll still consider the Bluray...<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Season 4 of Dexter has been pretty decent so far.  It doesn't have the same allure and mystery of the first season, but definitely allows the characters to show some rich emotions.  There's plenty of suspense too.  But there have been a few things in these past 2 episodes that have really shown that Dexter, as a show, is back on its game.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b></em></p><div class='title'><b>The emotionless nature of a killer</b></div><p>In the beginning of episode 3, the Trinity killer works away on his second victim.  He brings her to the top of a warehouse and forces her to jump off by her own will.  Getting her to the warehouse and bringing her to the top is pretty easy, but now he has to threaten her to kill herself.  He does so by threatening her family.  With her children in danger, she lets go of the railing and falls to her death.</p><p>Near the end of the episode, Dexter is hunting down the neighborhood vandal.  He discovers who it is, and confronts him in his garage.  Exposing the vandal's identity isn't enough for the vandal to stop ruining the neighborhood.  Dexter roughs him up a little bit, but the vandal refuses.  He has nothing to lose.  Dexter threatens the vandal's family, and the vandal changes his mind pretty quickly.</p><p>I find it interesting how both Trinity and Dexter arrive to the same persuasive tactics, when all other options have been exhausted.  Being killers, they have no emotional connection to their victim, their victim's lives, or life in general.  They will stop at nothing to get their way, and will perform any action to get it.</p><p>Though, it doesn't really sound like much, but it was a parallel occurrence in this episode that linked Trinity and Dexter.  Dexter (the show) attempts to profile what it is to be a killer.  Every killer doesn't follow the same code, but perhaps a killer's code has a general set of guidelines?</p><div class='title'><b>Solving problems</b></div><p>Dexter's "dark passenger" brings him to interesting places and follows convenient leads.  Though, many of those leads in the first two seasons were very convenient for story.  In Season 1, Dexter stalked and killed a couple who were exploiting illegal Cuban immigrants.  After capturing and subduing the couple, he actually talked with them a little bit about relationships and how to "make it work."</p><p>Dexter was having trouble figuring out how to act as a boyfriend to Rita and didn't have anyone to talk to.  The only people he really can talk to are his victims, those who see Dexter for who he really is.  Dexter has no trouble talking to them about this problems, because he's comfortable.  He knows this conversation and "friendship" has a very soon expiration date.  This happens a couple other times, especially when confronts the man who killed his mother.</p><p>In episode 4 of Season 4, Dexter (the show) returns to this problem solving technique when Dexter (the character) stalks and captures a woman who murdered her own family.  A woman who couldn't take the annoying, badgering, constant time loss of the daily grind of family life, so she "solved" it in a way most convenient for her.</p><p>Dexter has been fighting many of the same problems with married life, and "talks" about them with his victim.  Through their dialogue, he grows.  He finds out in himself that he really loves his family and that he would do anything to keep them from harm.</p><p>The release of his dark passenger always gives him clarity.  Room enough to think his way through his social problems.  Yes, killing does get in the way of his family life, but it's essential for his character growth, and for the show as well.</p><p>I don't remember this happening in Season 3 at all.</p><div class='title'><b>8 episodes remain</b></div><p>Season 4 is certainly returning to what made Dexter great.  I still think they're throwing too much suspense into the mix to distract away from the many many plot lines that no one cares about.  But Dexter and Trinity are the stars of this Season and are going strong.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/john-digweed-visions-chicago">John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The set lists that he builds are incredibly progressive and technically brilliant.  Tracks are meticulously chosen to build the progression of the set into a massive wall of bass.  Every time I've seen Digweed live, I have been absolutely blown away and wonder why I don't follow him as much as other DJs.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp"  /></p><p>The last time, I saw Digweed was with Sasha for their Spring tour on <a href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">April 16th, 2008</a>.

At the end of both of those nights, I couldn't believe how fast the time had gone by..  Unfortunately, his set at Visions last night didn't capture they way he had in the past.  It felt a little off.  There were times during his set I felt took a little too long before pulling back into some amazing tracks.</p><p>And he played some pretty amazing tracks.  The thunderous bass, and subtle simple melodies completely immerse me into a body of a sound.

| October 11, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On Friday, some friends and I drank some beers and went to The Annex to hear MC Chris sing some rap songs.  This is the second time I've seen him live and it's a little bit different than the last time.</p><p>The first time I saw him live was at The High Noon Saloon in Madison on April 27, 2009.  And that was actually the first time I ever heard of his music, too.  I had only known him from Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Sealab 2021, and didn't realize that he had such a body of work outside of Adult Swim.</p><p>I find his music to be somewhat inconsistent.  It seems to bounce back and forth between actual Hip Hop and Nerdcore.  I'm sure that's fine for people who like Hip Hop, but I'm not a fan.  Nerdcore is hilarious because I can actually identify with the Lyrics, but once he starts rapping about fuckin' people up and ass-jammin', I start to tune him out.</p><p>In a nerdy town like Madison, his performance was loaded with hilarious references to movies, games, and food.  He definitely won me over that night in April.  With the CDs I purchased at the show, I listened to them over and over, and eventually got all his previous CDs online and became a fan. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp"  /></p><p>Last Night, his performance followed that same pattern.  Here's most of the set list that I can recall...</p><p>1. ???<br/>2. ???<br/>3. Pizza Butt<br/>4. Japanese Maid<br/>5. Neville<br/>6. ???<br/>7. ??? (Robot Dog?)<br/>8. ???<br/>9. Robotussin<br/>10. Wiid<br/>11. Hoodie Ninja<br/>12. Geek<br/>13. Nrrrd Girl<br/>14. MC Chris is Dead<br/>15. IG-88<br/>16. Fett's Vette</p><p>He also told his story about a previous show at The Annex, where someone walked in on him taking a shit, which is probably why he performed at The High Noon Saloon earlier this year.  He also complained about the Killer Croc fight in Batman Arkham Asylum, which isn't that hard.  Though, after the show I mentioned that he might want to try flipping around using the Grappling Hook, rather than walking on the wooden planks.</p><p>Around that time, he was kind enough to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp">sign my CDs</a> and be photographed with me.

The genre attaches itself to my generation rather easily because those sets of sounds were the soundtrack to our youth.  The genre boasts many technical artists who try to get the most out of the primitive sound set, and others who try to make nifty sounding songs.  There's a fair amount of nostalgia listening to Chiptunes, but it still within the realm of electronica.</p><p>That isn't true with I Fight Dragons, who sing about Poppy nonsense from inspirations such as Weezer.  I think their songs stand on their own without the Chiptunes at all.  I guess they were trying to figure out someway of combining their love for Weezer and their childhood?  "Just sprinkle a little Nintendo on the top and we'll be so nerdy!"  Though, I'm sure some of those dudes are pretty nerdy.</p><p>It's one thing to cover old NES songs like Minibosses and many others, or to bring instruments into Chiptunes like Anamaguchi, but bringing Chiptunes into another genre with no context, cheapens the quality of your music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp"  /></p><p>Anyways, I bought their CD before the show and have listened to it a few times.  On a positive note, they are pretty decent for a Pop group.  If you visit <a href="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch" title="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch" title="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch">IFightDragons.Com/GimmeFreeMusicBitch</a>, you can download some of their songs.  If you sign up for their mailing list, they'll send you a link for 7 more songs.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dark Dark Dark " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dark-dark-dark">Dark Dark Dark </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I had never heard of any of these people before, but the event was gaining some acclaim on MNVibe, so I figured it would be a good idea to check out.</p><p>Well, It wasn't quite what I expected.  It was held in a large community center type room with a shit load of wooden folding chairs filling the entire space.  "Ok.. I guess it's a 'sit down' concert.." I thought.  Jess and I grabbed some seats up front since it was pretty empty.  As the room began to fill with more and more of Minneapolis' hippy youth, it was starting to dawn on me that the music we were going to hear tonight probably wasn't the type of electronic music that I frequent.</p><p>There were some pretty weird people hanging around and talking with each.  My little sister and I kept ourselves busy by pointing out some other these people to each other.  After 20 minutes rolled on by (we got there kinda early), the room will pretty full.  The lights dimmed.  And some of those people we noticed earlier took the stage.  It was Dark Dark Dark..  And the crowd went overly politely silent.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp"  /></p><p>They began singing some songs with the audience at complete attention.  After each tune, the audience cheered and applauded for about 15 to 20 seconds, and then DEAD silence.  I mean, absolute silence in the entire hall of 300 or 400 people.  Not a single word was spoken for another 10 seconds, and they began their next song.  After they finished their song, there was applause and cheer and SILENCE.  It was the weirdest, most awkward concert experience I've ever had.</p><p>But Dark Dark Dark plays some interesting music.  The accordion brings an incredible old Italian romantic feel to their songs.  The banjo keeps the songs from getting too serious, and adds a laid-back layer to the sound.  And they have some cellos to provide bass lines.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp"  /></p><p>Even though it's very different from the "normal" music I listen to, their songs were very passionate and conveyed a very unique sound.  It's romantic and lonely and desperate and very human.  It feels like so much of their lives are each of their songs.  After listening to their music, it's like I just had a long conversation with them about their lives and how they live.</p><p>After performing several songs, the atmosphere of The Cedar became a little less awkward.  Head band members Nona Marie Invie and Marshall LaCount began chatting a little bit between songs and provided some background context.  At first glance, I thought they were brother and sister, but my mind was blown when they first mentioned children.  I guess when people find their soul mate and embrace it, they begin slowly transforming into one person.</p><p>Their set lasted an hour and a half, I'd say..  After some setup Dosh, started his set, which was pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dark Dark Dark (opening for Why?) @ UW-Memorial Union, Madison</b></div><p><em>which happened today, October 6th 2009</em></p><p>A month ago, I noticed Dark Dark Dark were going to be in Madison.  Even though, the skies were dark, and winds were fierce, I braved the storms and went downtown to see 'em.  Upon entering UW-Memorial, the Rathskellar was full of Madison's hippy youth.  I immediately knew I was in the right spot.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp"  /></p><p>Once again, their performance started off awkward.  Not as awkward as absolute silence, but awkward for the opposite reason.  Too many fucking people talking.  There are 2 very big reasons for this.  #1) This concert was free.  #2) The Rathskellar sells Beer.  The inhabitants of Wisconsin are a bunch of loud obnoxious drunks, so when we get any amount of Beer in our systems, our self-consciousness and attention span goes right out the window.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of the on-stage conversation Dark Dark Dark was trying to have was different to hear because of the noise.  Nona asked the audience how many people were from Minneapolis and not a single person raised their hand.  She asked another question, which I couldn't quite make out, that also went unanswered.</p><p>Their music was still just as romantic and infectious as the first time I heard it.  They were only on stage for an hour, but throughout that hour the atmosphere had changed.  By the end, everyone was on their feet at the stage.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Snow Magic</b></div><p>Back in December, after hearing Dark Dark Dark, I felt compelled to purchase their album, and I did.  But, I hadn't ever been in the mood to actually listen to it.  After recanting all these feelings I've had listening to their music live, I haven't really listened to them on my own.  But, I still have the CD and plan on giving it a listen.</p><p>The Snow Magic is their only album out right now.  Though, at their show tonight, they had a Vinyl single that contains two remixes.  DJ Odd Nosdam remixes "Junk Bones", and Dosh remixes "All the Things".  It seems like all those guys are pretty tight. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Moby @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">Moby @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I saw one of my favorite musical artists live on stage for the first time.  I haven't been with Moby since his beginning but since he released his album Play, I've been hooked.  Moby has a very infectious ambient sound that can calm my mood, but has been born out of a riot of punk and trance that he always keeps at his side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp"  /></p><p>Last Thursday, his concert displayed the range of his body of work.  It was like a concert of his greatest hits.  After a few songs, I thought it was a good idea to jot down his set list...</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. ???<br/>3. Wait for Me (Wait for Me)<br/>4. ???  (probably Jam for the Ladies)<br/>5. Bodyrock (Play)<br/>6. Go<br/>7. Pale Horses (Wait for Me)<br/>8. Great Escape (18)<br/>9. South Side (Play)<br/>10. In My Heart (18)<br/>11. ??? (Piano, "summer"?)<br/>12. Why Does My heart Feel so bad? (Play)<br/>13. We are all made of Stars (18)<br/>14. Porcelain (Play)<br/>15. "Take a walk on the Wild Side"<br/>16. Walk with me (Wait for Me)<br/>17. Natural Blues (Play)<br/>18. Porn Song from 1972<br/>19. Raining Again (Hotel)</p><p>Encore<br/>1. In this World (18)<br/>2. ??? (If I fall, let me go?)<br/>3. Extreme Ways (18)<br/>4. Honey (Play) + ???  (Guitar Hero)<br/>5. Feeling so Real</p><p>There are very very few concerts or musical events that I've attending where I knew the words to almost all the songs, but that I loved every minute of his 2 1/2 hour set.  In most concerts, the group only focuses on their most recent material...  Other groups are caught up in all their greatest hits from when they were good.  Even though, he played only a few songs from his new album, Wait for Me, Moby proves that his new album is stands along side his greatest songs.</p><p>With each song he played, the original melody and chrous was in tact, but was performed with the flavor and creativity building since its initial release.  Even though he "ended" with Raining Again, it wasn't the same version of the song you'd hear on the record from 2005.  He started off with the Porno music, and used that aura as a different direction to present the song.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics</b></div><p>After listening to The Protomen last year on <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen" title="/the-protomen" title="/the-protomen">June 13th 2008</a>, I modify my opinion of Lyrics in Songs.  Even though, they skew or are sometimes inconsistent with the message of the music, they provide a very solid base for remixes and future adaptations, almost as strong as melody.  Well, lyrics are basically part of the melody.  The only difference is that Lyrics have a literal meaning in language, whereas melody is interpretive.</p><p>Both are essential for defining a song.  They are the key component for any remix.

| September 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Like Seasons 2 and 3, the first episode of the new Season of Dexter was leaked to the Internet just a few weeks before its premiere.  It's almost like it's intentional.  It definitely seemed intentional with Seasons 2 and 3.  The quality of the DivX file was superb.  The file I have of Season 4 episode 1 is pretty crappy, so I don't think it was intentional this time.  But who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Where we've been</b></div><p>Dexter is a pretty great show.  Season 1 was an amazing introduction to Dexter.  It displayed Dexter's thoughts and reasoning.  The emergence of a rival serial killer offered mystery, and eventually unraveled into a mirror of himself, his past, and his future.</p><p>Season 2 lost the mystery, but masked it with constant suspense.  Season 2 builds on all the character development from the previous season and demonstrates how well rounded the characters and cast are.  Unfortunately, it is a shallow experience compared to the first Season.</p><p>The typecast, thin representation of the Dexter cast really shows its colors in Season 3.  Season 3 settles down the suspense and mystery and adds character plot after character plot.  Dexter starts to lose spotlight, and Debra, Angel, and Laguerta become essential characters.  I think the writers and producers have become to comfortable with their jobs after Dexter was renewed up through Season 5 given the success of Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>The acting and writing has become very much like a sitcom.  Each actor has their character and always operates in these roles.  The only person that brings any personality to their character is Michael C. Hall with Dexter, which is ironic as he plays an emotionally distanced character.  It's gotten so transparent that it's difficult to watch.</p><p>I'd stop watching the show if I wasn't so invested in these characters.  Plus, I hold hope that Dexter will eventually recapture what made Season 1 so fantastic.  But I think they've completely run Dexter's character dry for story.  Maybe that's why the other characters have become so prevalent.</p><p>Season 3 is a stain in this series and takes it further away from what made it great.  Though, after watching the first episode of Season 4 that gleaming shimmer of hope flickers in my eye.</p><div class='title'><b>New Beginnings</b></div><p>Once the news broke that <b>John Lithgow</b> was the villian in Season 4, I was immediately excited.  Finally, a REAL actor in this dying show.  Michael C. Hall is a pretty good actor, but his range is not nearly as vast as Lithgow.  I was excited to see what they had in store.  Plus, there hasn't been a serial killer villain worth his weight since Season 1.</p><p>Rudy (or whomever) was the perfect villain for Season 1.  But Season 2 and 3?  Technically both seasons had its share of minor villains that Dexter had to vex in order to come out on top.  The story was spread and became weak as a result.  Aside from John Lithgow, Season 4's focus of a single villain should make the story much tighter.</p><div class='title'><b>Or is it..?</b></div><p>Unfortunately, with all these characters and stories of their own, I feel that the serial killing aspect of the show will become less and less important.  The writers seem to care more about the supporting cast and Dexter's home life than what the show was about to begin with.</p><p>Dexter always killed people as an outward expression of dealing with his problems.  It helped him work shit out.  But now, it just seems like he would be better off if he didn't.  His problems are the result of his serial killing.  So give it up!  Dexter already proved that this is not an addiction, so why is he still killing if it's screwing things up?</p><div class='title'><b>Ramble Ramble</b></div><p>Even though I'm pretty negative about the show, I'm still optimistic that Season 4 will turn out alright.  I don't see how it could be worse than Season 3, but the writers have a knack for throwing ridiculous plot points into the mix (SPOILER: such as the end of this first episode), so who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Dexter Season 4 begins this weekend on Showtime!</b></div></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Funny People" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/funny-people">Funny People</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's not necessary unlike anything Judd Apatow has done before, but it's certainly different and stand apart.</p><div class='title'><b>Slice of Life</b></div><p>Judd Apatow's strength has been his ability to translate real life on screen.  From the teenagers in Freaks and Geeks, to the freshmen in Undeclared, to the young adults in Knocked Up... from the awkward to the serious, Apatow has covered a wide range of emotions in his body of work.  So, it stands to reason that several emotions would affect the audience and hit rather close to home.</p><p>Freaks and Geeks detailed several aspects of my life, past and present, which made me painfully curious to watch.

Read all about it in these two horribly written and awkward blog posts from 2 years ago: <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">Oct 27th 2007</a>, <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">Oct 28th 2007</a>.</p><p>These movies and TV shows demand your attention if you've lived these lives, but can lose your attention if you haven't.  Funny People certainly didn't lose my attention, but it showcased lives that were not mine.  So, it didn't affect me the way Freaks and Geeks mirrored my soul.</p><div class='title'><b>Comedy</b></div><p>So much of a comedian's life is in this film.  Between Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler, they could put a real-life name to every character.  The experiences they've shared living together in Los Angeles and performing comedy at The Improv must've given them a wealth of stories for inspiration in a lot of the film's plot.</p><p>Seth Rogen's character, Ira Wright, is most likely based on Judd Apatow's struggle to be a successful stand up comedian.  He writes some pretty good jokes, but he's not very confident and they come out awkward.  His friends and roommates find successes in their careers, but he's left behind.  This was probably the exact setting in the mid to late 80s for Apatow and Sandler.  They probably had 3 or 4 years before Sandler was discovered in 1990 and hired in New York for Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Ira's luck changes when a famous comedian stumble's upon his act. Recognized for his writing talents, he's hired to write some jokes.  The same thing happened to Judd Apatow when Roseanne Barr caught his act in the late 80s.  I'd like to see that movie!  But, in Ira's case it is George Simmons, Adam Sandler's character.</p><p>George Simmons is a movie star, whose life has become empty with success.  He doesn't speak with his family, he has no close friends, and un-married, which doesn't describe Adam Sandler at all (from what I can tell, anyways).  George Simmons has made an onslaught of terrible embarrassing movies which define his career.  Adam Sandler has made some bad movies, but not as embarrassing as some of his colleagues, especially his pal Rob Schneider.  Though, Adam Sandler plays George Simmons as himself.  The way he talks and does comedy is all Sandler.</p><div class='title'><b>Groupies</b></div><p>An actual piece of Adam Sandler's reality placed in the film are groupies.  Now a days, Sandler has probably given up sex with random women, but after Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, he couldn't get rid of the amount of women at his doorstep.</p><p>This is shown in the film when Sandler and Seth Rogen pick up two girls at some Hollywood party.  Sandler fucks one girl. As Rogen fails with the other one, Sandler fucks her too.  He remarks on his behavior as it being easy for him, "These girls want to fulfill their fantasy to fuck a movie star, and I take advantage of that.  It doesn't matter because they always leave unsatisfied."  It's kinda like Sandler is apologizing to all the girls he took advantage of before his marriage.</p><p>I think this is true because this is the second instance Movie Star Groupies has come up between Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow.  Sandler guest starred in an episode of Undeclared where he did the exact same thing.  Though, in the context of the show, it was much more flattering for Sandler at the time. Especially since he wasn't married at the time.</p><div class='title'><b>Juxtaposition and age</b></div><p>Funny People bounces back and forth between Seth Rogen and Adam Sandler equally.  Seth Rogen experiences the beginning of a comedian's career, while Adam Sandler experiences the end, so to speak.  When Seth Rogen is thrust into the celebrity life style, he's shocked and amazed at all the perks and treats.  Adam Sandler just shrugs it off because this is his life.  He's the icon and that how he lives.</p><p>Adam Sandler begins showing his age and comments how the comedic life style is a young person's game.  If you have the talent, you will get discovered and you will thrive.  Horrible comedians don't last very long in the beginning. Comedians make almost no money doing stand up, and that life style weeds out the poor comedians pretty quickly.  You must put yourself through this hell so you can emerge victorious.</p><p>Being able to laugh at your situation is your muse.  And that ability is used quite often in Funny People, almost always at the sacrifice of good film making.</p><div class='title'><b>Technical Failure?</b></div><p>The pacing of Funny People is a horrible mess.  Serious scenes are often interrupted and almost ruined by the diversion of comedy.  For most of the movie, it's almost as if they had an outline of the plot and story, and then just filled in all the blanks while recording.</p><p>The interruptions aren't necessarily unwarranted.  A lot the abrupt comedy is presented as a coping mechanism to deal with the weight of the situation or bring the atmosphere back to something they're used to.  They are "Funny People" after all, so it makes sense that they'd deal with seriousness in a funny way.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, it makes the movie difficult to watch because it's constantly trying to be two movies at once.  There were point I thought were funny, but didn't know if I was supposed to laugh or if they were trying to be funny.  It's really confusing...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>But overall, Funny People really stuck with me.  So much of Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler are in the film.  It's hard not to like the honesty and reality.  Adam Sandler is great in the film and the supporting cast is hilarious.</p><p>At 2 hours 15 minutes, it is a little long though.  As the film rounded the 2 hour mark, I was wondering when they were going to end it.  Is this the end?  nope..  Is this the end? nope...  They did end on a good note though. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check it out if you're a fan of the Apatow crew.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The History and Timeline of District 9" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-history-and-timeline-of-district-9">The History and Timeline of District 9</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 17, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>[<i>Hi.  This is written for people who have seen the film, District 9.  It contains several spoilers towards the end, so make sure to see the film first.  The information about South African history was taken from articles on Wikipedia.</i>]</p><div class='title'><b>British Colonization</b></div><p>After the British invaded in the 1800s and began colonizing South Africa, violence continued to climb between the colonials and the natives.  Racial violence had to stop.  In the 1890s, the British ruling party began to groundwork of what would become the Apartheid system.</p><p>It began with the Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892, which limited education.  The General Pass Regulations Bill of 1905 denied them their right to vote.  The South Africa Act of 1910 gave the British ruling power over all races of South Africa.  The Native Land Act of 1913 kept blacks from buying land outside of their "reserves".  The Natives in Urban Areas Bill of 1918 forced blacks into their own communities.  The Urban Areas Act of 1923 gave the white industry plenty of cheap labor.  The Native Administration Act of 1927 gave the British ruling over all South African affairs  The Native Land and Trust Act of 1936 which further strengthened the 1913 law.  (and) The Asiatic Land Tenure Bill of 1946 which kept the natives from selling their land to foreigners other than the British.</p><div class='title'><b>Apartheid</b></div><p>These laws became an institution beginning in 1948 known as Apartheid.  This system would further strengthen in the years to follow as further legislation was passed to refine and tighten these bills.  Segregation continued and was upheld by law.</p><p>The laws of Apartheid would prohibit marriage and sexual acts between race, require all citizens to carry and ID card with their race classification, demolish "run down" black neighborhoods, ban communism (of course), crafted a separate education system, and the Black Homeland Citizen Act of 1970 which removed black citizenship altogether!</p><p>In 1966, these laws were used in Cape Town, to forcibly remove the black population of 60,000 from District Six to Cape Flats, 25km away.</p><div class='title'><b>Protesting</b></div><p>As the laws became increasingly ridiculous, students from all races in Africa began protesting the ruling government.  The tipping point began on June 16, 1976 during the Soweto Uprising.  Students took to the streets and protested the forced tuition.  Police opened fire on the peaceful protest killing up to 600 and injuring 4000.  After that, student organizations were formed for the pure purpose of protesting Apartheid.  These organizations were formed all around the entire country.</p><p>Labor Unions began protesting with the students.  Churches joined the protests, too.  The black and native communities began to unite.</p><div class='title'><b>Civil War</b></div><p>South African security was the biggest political concern of the 1980s.  With increased violence and continuous offenses to the Apartheid System, President PW Botha declared a State of Emergency on July 20, 1985 in the most prominent areas of the country.  Under the Internal Security Act, people were put under house arrest and detained without trial.  On June 12, 1986 (4 days before the 10th Anniversary of the Soweto Uprising), the State of Emergency extended to the entire country.  In 1987, the State of Emergency was renewed up through 1989.  Over those 4 years, 30,000 people were detained, arrested, interrogated and many tortured.</p><p>In 1989, President Botha suffered a stroke and was forced to resign.  On February 13, 1989, he was succeeded by FW de Klerk.  De Klerk made moves to end the political stalemate and repeal the laws of Apartheid.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Threat?</b></div><p>1990 was the pivotal point in South African history that would demolish the Apartheid system.  However, things changed a little bit when a huge alien mothership set itself in the air directly above Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city.  It just appeared there and gave no indication of its plans.  After 3 months with no communication, the government flew to the craft, bore a hole through its hull, and discovered an alien race inside.  </p><p>They were extremely weak and malnourished.  The South African government began extracting the population of one million.  They gave them District 9.</p><p>With the discovery of a new life form to earth, the South Africa population united and quickly negotiated a resolution to the Apartheid system peacefully and successfully.  But enacted new laws to "handle" the alien population.  The Apartheid system was reborn and segregated aliens and humans.  These laws seemed to make sense given they were a completely separate life form.</p><p>The aliens seemed aimless and savage.  Many have speculated as to how they achieved the intelligence to constructor and operate the interstellar vessel that brought them to our planet.  The popular theory is that the population is mostly workers or soldiers without leadership or direction.  Those aliens in power either abandoned ship or are deceased.</p><div class='title'><b>Alive in Joburg</b></div><p>In 2005, Neill Blomkamp (director of District 9) created a documentary of life in Johannesburg.  It's available online on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837">Google Video</a> and on <a href="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg" title="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg" title="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg">SpyFilms website</a>.  The film has been released by SpyFilms.</p><p>Alive in Joburg demonstrates the living conditions of District 9.  The aliens scavenge garbage piles for food.  They eat raw meat from slaughter cows.  The stench is awful.</p><div class='title'><b>Neill Blomkamp</b></div><p>Alive in Joburg was the first work created by Neill Blomkamp, and sparked the attention of Peter Jackson.  In 2007, they teamed up to create a short film entitled Crossing the Line (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q">trailer</a>).  Impressed with Blomkamp's vision and ideals, Jackson contracted Blomkamp to direct the film version of Halo, the popular Xbox game.</p><p>Constant disagreements between Microsoft and the movie studios cast doubt on Blomkamp who had never directed a full motion picture.  Though, Peter Jackson had no doubt in his mind.  Jackson and Blomkamp talked about revisiting Alive in Joburg and expanding.  In 2007 or 2008, Jackson put the Halo film on hiatus and they began to create District 9.</p><div class='title'><b>District 9</b></div><p>Next Year will mark the 20th Anniversary of the alien arrival in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The conditions of District 9 have become out of control, and the government wlll contract private arms corporation MNU to move the alien population to a location 200km away from Johannesburg labeled District 10.</p><p>Wkus var de Merwe is appointed head of the operation to extract the aliens from District 9.  He's a very lovable Michael Scott type of person.  Wikus var de Merwe is portrayed by Sharlto Copley who has almost no movie credits to his name.  District 9 is his actorial debut.  His only previous credit of note is the writer/director of the film Spoon released in 2008.</p><p>The extraction goes awry when Wikus contracts a virus from a recovered alien artifact.</p><div class='title'><b>Filming</b></div><p>Even though District 9 adopts the documentary style of Alive in Joburg, it fills in the rest of the story with traditional film portrayal.  The documentary style is vital for providing the history and information about District 9 and the events of August 8-10, 2010.  The traditional style provides the story of Wikus and his internal struggle with the virus.</p><p>The film's main focus is Apartheid.  District 9 is drenched in Apartheid commentary but it's not delivered in a history lesson (such as this post).  In fact, it's not even mentioned once!  I find that incredibly interesting.  I didn't know any about Apartheid until I read reviews after seeing the movie.</p><p>The social commentary is pretty thick, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film.  It builds tremendous sympathy for the aliens, though "white" guilt may factor, too.</p><div class='title'><b>To Be Continued...?</b></div><p>As the virus mutates and transforms Wikus into one of the aliens, he aids one of the alien pilots into recovering the fuel for the mothership.  On August 10, 2010, the pilot reboards the mothership with his shuttle pod and the mothership leaves earth.  He tells Wikus that it will take him 3 years to return to earth and promises that he will return to restore Wikus back into a human.  The remaining alien population is moved to District 10 and Wikus has completely vanished.</p><p>Will Peter Jackson and Neill Blomkamp return to Johannesburg in 2013 when the mothership is expected to return?</p><p>It seems pretty definite to me.  In 3 days, it earned $37 million in the US, making a profit of $7 million.  With an absolutely hit on their hands and an open ending with expected future events, why wouldn't they make District 10?</p><p>But it might be awhile since Neill Blomkamp has proven his cinematic prowess to the film studios, and Microsoft will probably want to get the Halo film back on track.  Will the Halo movie be put on hold again for a District 9 sequel?  Will Halo be Blomkamp's next film?  Or will they scrap both ideas for something completely new?</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>I'm pretty sure this timeline is correct.  I was paying close attention to the dates in District 9 when I saw it for the second time today.  The video feed from cameras during Wikus' capture and manhunt state Aug 10 2010.  The film mentions that the mothership has been on earth for 20 years, putting the arrival date in 1990.  1990 is also the date given in Alive in Joburg.  Wikipedia backs up this information.</p><p>However, the film synopsis on most film sites say the mothership arrived 30 years ago and the Theatrical Trailer says 28 years ago.  I don't know what the believe now.  Of course, trailers aren't created by the studio, it's created by the corporation to market the thing.</p><p>They probably just got the date wrong.  And all the film sites base their synopsis from the trailer.  Though, the commentary on the eventually rental release should be interesting as to what is actually going on here.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/9">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/7">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
