Tonight at 9 (10 eastern) an episode of Life will air starting a two-parter to end in its usual timeslot of Wednesday.  Next Monday, Journeyman returns with its Christmas episodes and the next week will contain two episodes ending at half a season.  These two episodes promise to bring some answers as to what is actually going on with Dan's time leaping.</p><p>The internet's mobilization to Save Journeyman begins today!</p><p>What you can do to help save Journeyman is log on to nbc.com and watch episode 10 entitled "Blowback".  In fact, here's a quick link for you: <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml" title="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml" title="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml">http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml</a>.</p><p>This is the most recent episode of Journeyman and has really been the highlight of the show thus far.  In "Blowback", Dan learns more about the limitations of changing the past and how to fix mistakes when he alters the past beyond his "goal", whether or not his alterations were ethical.</p><p>The goal of this "demostration" is to show that people out there want to watch this show.  A spike in their online ratings should show we care right?</p><div class='title'><b>Quantum Leap</b></div><p>On a side note, one of my friends starting Netflixing Quantum Leap, so we've been watching an episode here and there.  That show is really a trip back in time in itself these days, seeing how it was made back in 1982.  Going back in time even further than that to fix the past makes it very interesting on several levels.</p><p>The shows humor and story are still quite solid to this day.  Definitely check it out, especially if you remember watching that show.  I used to watch that show over and over again when they aired re-runs on USA and the Scifi channel. ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman &quot;final&quot; episode will air" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-final-episode-will-air">Journeyman "final" episode will air</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Episode 10 will air on Monday December 10th, followed by Episode 11 on the following Monday.  Episode 12 is placed on Wednesday December 19th at 10/9c.  Not too shabby.  (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>As that article suggested, the decision to air episode 12 came from the caring, passionate support of internet fans, namely those at <a href="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/">SaveJourneyman.net</a>.  Those involved with the site are trying to organize a "Save our Show" campaign similar to what happened with Jericho.</p><p>Earlier this year <a href="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/">Nuts Online .com</a> instituted a campaign called "Nuts for Jericho" where fans contributed money towards a daily shipment of peanuts to CBS New York.  A grand total of $56,968 was spent, totaling over 8 million peanuts.  Check it out: <a href="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho">Nuts for Jericho</a>.</p><p>And it worked!  CBS signed Jericho for a 2nd season.</p><p>It doesn't really look like SaveJourneyman.net is as organized as Nuts for Jericho, but there's plenty of time.. thanks to the strike.  Even though Life and Chuck were renewed, they still need to make those episodes..  If the strike is resolved within this next month, I wonder if they'll try to complete seasons by May..</p><p>hmm... I should probably netflix Jericho to see what all the fuss is about.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to NBC Monday Night updates" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nbc-monday-night-updates">NBC Monday Night updates</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After last week's phenomenal episode, the story continues to build to the fall season finale.  This story arc ends next week, and with that we probably won't see any new episodes of Heroes for a while, due to strike.  With the strike..  episode 11 of Heroes Season 2 is somewhat posed to be the overall season finale. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>Recanting <a href="/old/v7/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman">last week's post</a>, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter (episodes 8 and 9) .. brings big numbers."  I watched both episodes and they were quite good.  I'm almost sad to see the show go.  The plot of Journeyman is really coming together, and the fall finale (two-parter of episodes 11 and 12) bring the plot full circle as it is finally told why Dan is traveling through time.</p><p>Journeyman has 3 episodes left, but won't be airing next week.  Next week, after Heroes, that new cop-drama, Life, will air the beginning of a two-parter to end on its normal timeslot on Wednesday.  The week after is Journeyman's "Christmas episode".  The next Monday after that on December 17th, will be the first episode of the finale, episode 11.  Unfortunately, it seems that episode 12 may not even air according to <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883">Aint it Cool</a>.</p><p>After watching this past week, I'm really quite excited to see what happens, but with the numbers in the toilet, it doesn't seem like Journeyman will even gets its end aired.  But, for those fans out there, Journeyman will be released on DVD will its high-budgeted music soundtrack intact, and including all episodes. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>At this time, NBC has ordered more episodes of Life and that crappy show Chuck, through the rest of their debut seasons...  but Journeyman is still on the chopping block. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>I'd probably like Journeyman more if the episodes followed a stricter plot.  The episodes have been very episodic, giving bits and pieces of the overall plot in each episode.  I'd much rather be absorbed in the story the whole time, like in Heroes and Lost, then you can see everything in the show develop at once.. characters evolve..  plot is continuous.  You never feel like you're wasting your time watching an episode.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>In other news.... Strike</b></div><p>Some of the commercials tonight for new programming beginning in January really makes me feel like the Strike is taking its toll on programming.  Especially with a trailer for the return of <b>American Gladiators</b> to prime-time television, beginning January 7th-ish.  ugh...  I'll probably still watch the premiere episode, though..</p><p>Some good news, though..  Yet another <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897">Aint it Cool</a> article states that the strike could be resolved before Christmas.  Nice! ^_^</p><p>...and just in time for the strike ending, I got my "Support the Strike" cancer bracelets in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" /></p><p>Lemme know if you'd like a bracelet..

Its Heroes night.  Tonight's Heroes is chapter 9 of the 11 chapter fall season.  The next two weeks will put a cap on the current story arc that supposedly explodes tonight.

Journeyman is a lot like a modern day Quantum Leep that puts Drama ahead of Science Fiction.  The stories are interesting, but the characters are so serious and unlikeable, it makes watching the show difficult.</p><p>Tonight and next week end the fall season of Journeyman with a two-parter, and possibly the last Journeyman we'll ever see, states <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34841" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34841" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34841">Ain't it cool News</a>.  To paraphrase, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter airing tonight and next Monday brings big numbers."</p><p>I suppose this would be a good time to talk about Neilson ratings and market share or something else if I actually knew what I were talking about..  I would like to see just how big the viewer difference is between Heroes season 2 and Journeyman.</p><p>Anyways, kiss your ass goodbye Journeyman.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Undeclared" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/undeclared">Undeclared</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 6, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>My whole reason for signing up with Netflix was to rent Undeclared.  Undeclared is a TV show that aired on Fox beginning in 2000 and lasting one mere season before being canceled.  Much like other brilliant Fox comedies, we hardly knew ye.</p><div class='title'><b>Premise</b></div><p>Undeclared centers on Steven Karp, new freshman to the University of Northeastern California.  Now in college, Steven is able to shed his geek nature and start a new life.  His roommates are Lloyd, a dashing british exchange student going for a degree in theater, Ron, a business major played by Seth Rogen, and Marshall, a scruffy looking guy working on a music degree despite his parents pushing his into business.</p><p>The first night of college changes Steven's life as he meets Lizzie, a cute girl from across the hall with an overprotective boyfriend at home, played by Jason Segal.  Her roommate is Rachael, whose having her own problems with adjusting to college.</p><p>Each episode attempts to center on a specific topic of adjusting to college life, much like Freaks and Geeks did for High School and home life.</p><div class='title'><b>Interest</b></div><p>Undeclared was created by Judd Apatow, which was the sole purpose for my initial interest in the show.  He also co-created Freaks and Greeks which I've written about before (<a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">here</a> and <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">here</a>).  He's also been chiefly responsible for 40 year old virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad.  All with the underlying theme of Freaks and Geeks..  Freaks being pot heads and burn outs, and Geeks being..  geeks.  Because they follow this pattern, Judd Apatow's properties are full of movie references and drug humor which our generation can easily identify with.</p><p>Undeclared is no different than the rest but really shows Apatow's true calling in his craft.  Don't get me wrong, I think Freaks and Geeks is probably his greatest show to date, but it's too heavy and too real.  I feel so much emotion when watching that show, I'm not sure how more of it I can take..  Undeclared takes a step back from that and focuses more on the comedy.  The comedy floats to the surface and lets the subtle drama aspects govern the plot, but not the scene.</p><p>The Office uses a similar formula.  You come to the show for its comedy, but stay and continue to watch because of the characters and their relationships.  The Office wouldn't work with any other actors playing these characters, and neither would Undeclared.</p><p>Squeezing the show into half an hour really forces the comedy to take center stage too.  There's really no time to build a compelling drama high in such a short time and still make it funny.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>This show is pretty damn hilarious..  Each character and actor complements each other so well..  It makes the show incredibly believable and enjoyable.  Definitely check it out ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Writer's Guild of America on Strike" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/writers-guild-of-america-on-strike">Writer's Guild of America on Strike</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Writer's Guild of America's Contract ended on Halloween and without fair wages and proper benefits to renew their contract, they strike! Which means if this is not resolved in a timely matter, all our favorite shows will see some major hiatus.</p><p>As the article states, Late night shows will be the first to suffer and won't be seen tonight.  Sitcoms and Dramas, such as The Office, 30 Rock, and Heroes have roughly 5 unaired episodes at their disposal, which will keep the shows "new" until the end of November.</p><p>For Lost, lostpedia says that they are in the middle of filming episode 4 of season 4, but with plans to air the show without hiatus, we may see Lost season 4 a bit later than February next year.</p><p>Honestly though, this isn't so bad.  It'll give us a chance to wake up for our television coma, just as we did in the summer months.  We can go outside and enjoy the winter when TV runs out of TV at the end of November.  Plenty of time to start renting TV shows out on DVD.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688">Ain't it cool news</a><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Office tonight" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-office-tonight">The Office tonight</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 1, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Has Tonight's episode of NBC's smash hit The Office begun a story arc that will encompass the rest of the season and into the next.?  Now that they jumped the shark at the end of season 3, I was really wonder what they were going to do with the show..</p><div class='title'><b>Recap</b></div><p>Last season, everyone finally got what they wanted when after 3 season of tickling our assholes, Jim finally made a move to date Pam.  This story arc really began in Season 2 when Jim's feelings  surfaced episode after episode of awkwardness.  At the end Season 2, he finally told her about his love before she married Roy.</p><p>Jim saw this as his last opportunity to profess his feelings before taking a job in New York to get away from these feelings.  Season 3 began rather awkward focusing on Jim in the New York and the regular cast back in the Scranton branch.  Pam had called off the wedding and began searching for what she wanted.  While at the New York branch, Jim started dating fellow co-worker Karen..</p><p>Eventually these two branches became one and bits of drama began to ensue..  Now that Pam was free, it took all season for Jim to realize what he wanted was there, and that Karen was out of desperation.</p><p>6 weeks in, Karen has come back into the show and we find that she's a general manager of her own branch of Dunder Miflin.</p><div class='title'><b>Business Side of things</b></div><p>There are two points of business at work for this show..  There really is no overall story anymore with Jim and Pam together.  They tried to do something with Dwight and Angela, but their characters are as captivating as Jim and Pam.  The same with Michael and Jan.  These romances are more comical than real..  they have their moments, but not enough to carry the show.</p><p>At the same time, NBC's Thursday night line-up has a flat-tire at 8.30pm.  Scrubs is a funny show, but once you've seen a bunch of episodes, you've seen it all.  Except for story elements, you could watch a new episode and swear you've seen it before..  Scrubs will end in May 2008, so what the hell are they going to do to replace it?</p><p>News Article: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619">NBC developing The Office 2</a></p><p>It looks like The Office will be trailing The Office next fall in place of the Scrubs time slot..</p><div class='title'><b>Speculation?</b></div><p>With tonight's episode with Karen managing the Uttica branch of Dunder Miflin..  Is this the beginning of The Office 2?  Will this season start to tear apart itself after season 3 began stitching the cast back together at Scranton?</p><p>This doesn't sound like a particularly great idea..  The Office really works because of its great cast..  finding another cast as balanced and hilarious will not be easy..  I think it would have a LONG way to go without feeling like a complete ripoff.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Heroes Speculation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/heroes-speculation">Heroes Speculation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Especially with the trailer for the next episode.  Peter makes his way to Canada, finds stuff in the helix marked apartment and moves into the future with the irish girl.  They find themselves in downtown New York (against a green screen), where the streets are deserted and full of trash..  A slightly different apocolyptic vision than Hiro saw last season..</p><p>Hiro went into the future twice in season 1.  The first time was a glimpse of New York right before "the bomb" went off.  The second time was a few years after that with New York in ruins and the public going ape-shit after mutants.</p><p>The future that Peter has traveled to shows that by stopping "the bomb" last season, they did INDEED change the future.  I guess we already knew that, though..  The date and time of "the bomb's" explosion had already passed from what it should have been.</p><p>Peter picks up a piece of paper that reads "Evacution, June 2008", which puts them near the date of the final episode of Season 2.  The trailer goes on to say that 93% of the population was killed by a virus.. Most likely, the very virus Mohinder and Bob were talking about earlier to reverse mutants back into normal humans.  Looks like, in the future, Mohinder has failed in suspressing the company from making a virus/vacine..</p><p>It seems like they're following the same pattern from last season.  Catching a glimspe into the future reveals a catastrophic event only they can stop.  Save the cheerleader, Save the world..  what's the tagline going to be this time?  Stop the company, Save the world?  Stop parker's father, save the world?</p><p>I wonder when the first hiatus is....<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freaks and Geeks further thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">Freaks and Geeks further thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>After purchasing the Freaks and Geeks box set on Friday, I've really binged on the show.  Between Friday and Saturday morning, I watched the first 3 of the DVDs, totaling 9 episodes, an hour each.  Saturday night, I watched the next 2 DVDs by myself, and now I'm down to one remaining.</p><p>The more you get into this show, the formula really begins to set in.  I think the best way to describe this show is a mix between an after-school special, That 70s Show, and the Wonder years.  Most of the geeky jokes in the movie are really time centric with taking place in 1980.  A star wars reference here..  a star trek reference there..  Dallas, Welcome back Cotter..  It's the same formula that That 70s Show did until it began focusing on the characters.</p><p>This show has really begun to depress me, so I'm not really sure why I decided to binge on another six episodes..  I guess I couldn't stay away..  I think I'm going to lock up those final 3 episodes to watch them later on in the future.  How fitting that these final 3 episodes were never aired until ABC family picked up the syndication rights..</p><p>My old Madison roommates are somewhat on the same mind, but with Knocked Up, inside of Freaks and Geeks.  One of them relates to that movie with the same disdain because that was a life he almost lead.  The same feelings of entrapment and solid future were those he couldn't handle.</p><div class='title'><b>Suburbia</b></div><p>Freaks and Geeks really reminds me of the first Richard Linklater movie I saw..  Suburbia.  The first time I saw this movie, I was in awe with its realism.  Much like Freaks and Geeks, It really stuck with me for the next couple of days.</p><p>I've only seen it once, so I'm somewhat hazy on what point in time it takes place.  It was the last night in early September before all these high school friends went to college, the army, and another had a record deal.  This was the last day of their lives as citizen of their suburban town before they ventured into the world.  I think the year was 1985, or something like that.</p><p>Since it was their last night, they went through a wide range of emotions..  celebration, excitement, fear, loss..  pre-mature homesickness..  Their venture into the unknown..  A world outside theiir own.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>I saw this movie when I was a sophomore or junior in high school, so I viewed it as the same sort of fears I was supposed to have once I finished high school..  except I had no clue what the hell I was going to do at the time.</p><p>I was somewhat excited for this moment to happen for me..  To be at that point of no return with my high school friends, say goodbye for the final time and really feel for each other..  That never came for me..  Really, It was only until the end of last year and leaving Japan that I had that moment..  A conversation that ended on the tone that I would never see you again and I'm glad I met you...</p><p>That moment was real..  The moment was heartfelt..  With all my other friends in Japan..  I just turn on my computer and they're all on Instant Messenger..  but with that one person and that one moment.  It was the edge of the universe..</p><div class='title'><b>Scanner Darkly</b></div><p>Out of all other Linklater's movies, Scanner Darkly is the only other one that scratches at my emotions on some level.  There's only a few scenes that convey that slice of life feel, but I see myself in them none-the-less.  I think I'll leave it at that though...</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Now that I've seen Freaks and Geeks, I must see Undeclared.  I must see Judd Apatow's second building block of his cast of social rejects..  but, I really don't want to buy it.  I love Freaks and Geeks, but I probably could have gotten away with just borrowing it from someone..  I'll probably watch it again with someone who hasn't seen it, but never on my own.</p><p>There are a bunch of other TV shows I'd like to see too, like My So Called Life (as recommended by Erika), Californication, Weeds, Carnivale...  I'd also like to pick up where I left off with Six Feet Under (even though, Matt says the rest is dull).</p><p>Soooo....  maybe I'll start up a netflix account.  After comparing Blockbuster online versus Netflix, I think I'll definitely go with Netflix.  If Blockbuster had a video game service mixed in with DVDs, then there'd be no contest, but they don't.  And with their prices exactly the same, It really comes down to selection and with more Television shows, Anime, and obscure foreign movies Netflix has Blockbuster beat. Also, If I miss an episode of Heroes, I can watch it from netflix.com rather than nbc's crappy browser player.</p><p>I wonder how long it would take to get Undeclared disc 1 if I signed up now....<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freaks and Geeks" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Last night, I picked up the boxset of Freaks and Geeks, which contains all 18 episodes of the short-lived series.  I've so many things about this show and after watching Knocked Up and Superbad, I was really excited for it.  We watched about 6 or 7 episodes last night, and watched the remainder of the third disc this morning.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I really thought this show was going to be much more of a comedy than a drama.  I figured it was more on the lines of Undeclared, but I was way off.  I also thought each episode was going to be 30 minutes, but I was off on that too.  There's a lot more to this show than I expected which really through me back..</p><p>Freaks and Geeks is about freaks and geeks..  Set in 1980, it centers on Sam Weir, a freshmen high school who fails into the geek category of the show.  And centers on Lindsey Weir who is a junior or senior at the same high school.  She rejects her 'braininess' and wants to hang out with the 'cool' kids.. the 'freaks' category, which would be burnouts.</p><p>This show is incredible.  It is incredibly real and way too accurate that it's almost too much for me.  Freaks and Geeks fills me with so much sentiment, nostalgia, and memories of my own life in high school.  Good times, Bad times..  It's not like watching Back to the Future for the first time in 10 years and thinking back to the first time you saw this masterpiece..  It's living your life again..  too many social cares..  rejection..  affliation..  acceptance..  It's like watching a home movie of your life at age 14.</p><p>This slice of life is too big for me to handle..  It's really not a case of whether I like this show or not..  I feel like this show is me..  It's too good..  which is why it was cancelled. :/</p><p>I'll probably watch the rest of it tonight and tomorrow.</p><div class='title'><b>Judd Appatow</b></div><p>After Freaks and Geeks was cancelled, Judd Apatow (co-creator) went with a more comedic approach to the 'Freaks and Geeks' feel..  Undeclared was his next show, which featured 'Freaks and Geeks' in college.  Jocks became Frat boys..  Cheerleaders became Sorority girls..  but the social outcasts, where still outcasts.</p><p>It premiered on Fox, which probably doomed the show from the start.  It also only lasted one season.  I only remember seeing part of an episode, but I don't really remember it.  From what I remember, this is way more lighthearted than Freaks and Geeks.</p><p>Apparently, Judd Apatow has three other unaired television series that seem similar.  "Life on Parole", "North Hollywood", and "Sick in the Head".  Pilots were created for these three series, but they were very aired.</p><p>I guess the average TV viewer and Judd Apatow don't mix.  It's a damn shame though..  As far as popularity though, Apatow really struck it rich in the movies..  He hung with Will Ferril for a bit, and produced Anchorman, Kicking & Screaming (will ferril's crappy soccer movie), and Talladega Nights.</p><p>But his real talent lies in bringing slices of life into the theater..  He still comes back to the 'Freaks and Geeks' social groups, and made 3 movies in different points in time.  At the age 40 timeline, there's 40 year old virgin.  At the age 23-25 timeline, there's knocked up.  And at the age 18 timeline, there's Superbad.  You may not be the main characters in these movies, but chances are there's a character you relate to.</p><p>Another interesting fact is that Seth Rogen is in all 5 of Apatow's "slice of life" dramedies, and also several other actors and actresses as well.  Judd Apatow really doesn't give much direction when working with his talents, he produces these movies highlighting his talent's natural persona and let's them go loose.</p><div class='title'><b>Six Degrees of Separation</b></div><p>Besides Seth Rogen, Apatow reuses a lot of the talent that has been in his properties, and even the talent themselves have appeared in other films and TV together..  maybe its because when someone makes a geeky or burnout movie, these guys are the best candidates?  maybe its coincidence..?  fate..?  or perhaps they just like each ^_^.</p><p>I made <a href="/pages/apatow.html" title="/pages/apatow.html" title="/pages/apatow.html">a page</a> with all these social links.  Thank you, IMDB.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/13">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/11">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
