| December 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week is the last week for new TV.  Most shows have already finished, but "last to cross the finish line" new show <b>Journeyman</b> finally makes it in with Episode 11 tonight at 9pm central and Episode 12 on Wednesday at 9pm central.</p><div class='title'><b>Journeyman Finale</b></div><p>These final two episodes finally explain how Dan Vassar has been traveling through time answering that Lingering question.  Although with the end of the series, due to poor ratings, we are missing out on the bigger question of why Dan is traveling through time.  Series creator Kevin Falls has said that if the show had continued the season finale would have put all of Dan's time traveling into perspective.  Each leap through time is meant to align time in such a way to make an event happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, Journeyman was too slow and too disjointed to give this impression starting off.  If the audience would have realized Dan's time traveling was important, I think they would have much more viewers.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>January 2008</b></div><p>With Journeyman's finale 2007 ends, but despite the writer's continued strike, Late Night TV will return in January with or without their writers.  Specifically The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  Both shows will return and air new episodes beginning Wednesday January 2nd.</p><p>Both Leno and O'Brien have been huge supporters of the strike.  Their return is to start supporting their non-writing staff who have been laid off during these last two months of reruns.</p><p>David Letterman, on the other hand, is attacking the situation differently.  Letterman is attempting to strike an interim deal between Studio Execs and the WGA so when he returns on January 2nd, he'll have his writers.</p><p>Interesting developments..  The below linked article also suggests some alternative programming for Leno and Conan in lew of their monologue.  They might have more guests to fill in the time...</p><p>(source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A">New York times</a>)</p><div class='title'><b>February 2008</b></div><p>Besides Late Night returning, there are 2 amazing TV shows which return in the Spring that we haven't seen since their finales back in May..  Lost and Jericho.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 - Thursday January 31st, 8pm Central</b></div><p>On Friday, the Lost Season 4 trailer flew across the Internet and made many people happy.  Here it is, in case you missed it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho</a></p><p>At first I was baffled..  "really?  It's still coming out despite the strike?  Last I heard, they only completed 8 of the 16 episodes before November 1st."  Later in the day, Aint it cool <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076">reported</a> on the return of Lost stating that January 31st will be the beginning.</p><p>Upon further inspection, it looks they finished up Season 4 without the writers..  I mean, all the scripts were written before the strike began, but the writers are VERY involved with each episode as they make it.  They are always on hand to guide and shape each episode to fit their perfect vision.  They completed 8 episodes this way before the strike, so the final 8 episodes were done without the personal touch, which doesn't bode well.</p><p>Aint it Cool states that Showrunners Carlton Cruse and Damon Lindelof think the season finale is weak compared to previous Seasons.  That's rather pessimistic.</p><p>Lost Season 4 is 16 episodes which will air week after week without break.  I don't know if the season premiere and finale count as 2 each..  probably not.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho</b></div><p>Over the weekend, I caught my first glimpse of Jericho and my god..  this show is pretty damn awesome.  It's a lot like Lost except it hits real close to home..  I don't want to give away any of the story, though.</p><p>I went into Jericho episode 1 completely blind.  I had no idea what Jericho is, what is was about, or who was even in it.  All I knew is that the Internet saved this show and that people love it.  The first couple minutes of the show were pretty stereotypically, but when that climax music began to seep into the opening and you could absolutely tell that at any moment the plot of the entire show was going to hit...  I even said outloud.. "whatever is about to happen is going to make me love this show.. I just know it.."</p><p>then BAM...  I am an instant fan of this show.  It was totally engaging and made me want to watch every single episode after.</p><p>Jericho Season 1 has been out on DVD since October, so you can definitely netflix it..  OR you can watch every single episode of Jericho on the CBS website.  Yeah, it's crappy quality and Yeah, they have advertisements, but it'll give you a taste and, personally, a taste is all I needed.</p><p>Here's a quick link to all the episodes on cbs.com: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261" title="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261</a></p><p>If you really want to give yourself they perfect experience, Netflix the first DVD, put in it your player, turn up the sound, and turn off the lights.  You'll be on the edge of your seat.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho Season 2 - Tuesday February 12th, 9pm Central</b></div><p>Anyways, thanks to the Internet, Jericho has been saved from cancellation and CBS has ordered 8 more episodes.  If all goes well with the ratings, CBS will order the rest of the season and probably more to come ^_^.</p><p>Much like Lost and other shows, these 8 episodes were surely completed before the strike, so they should be magnificent.</p><div class='title'><b>Other shows</b></div><p>For now, that's really all I can foresee coming to TV.  Some episodes of The Office, 30Rock and Earl were completely before the strike, so those couple episodes will probably air here and there in the spring..</p><p>In the meantime though...  enjoy winter!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End of Journeyman" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-of-journeyman">End of Journeyman</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Monday, episode 10 of Journeyman aired and without Heroes to bring viewers to NBC on Monday Nights, the show didn't do so hot. Yesterday was NBC's deadline to secure the show for a second-half, but they passed on it, which means the cast is free to look for work elsewhere and has no obligation to continue working on the show. Balls..</p><p>This doesn't mean NBC can't renew the show.. They can do so at anytime. SaveJourneyman.Net is still holding on hope of renew. With the writer's strike there will certainly be a sharp decline of pilot episodes for the coming spring, so why not renew the show.. You aren't going to have anything new to show otherwise?</p><p>SaveJourneyman's compaign continues, though. Much like the Nuts for Jericho campaign, they are sending boxes of Rice-a-Roni to the studio executives along with letters from the future.</p><p>The most-likely final episodes of Journeyman will air on Monday and Wednesday next week and hope to answer some of the reasons why Dan is time-traveling and what is actually going on. They should have answered these questions much sooner. It would have made the show more interesting and plot heavy, rather than focusing on the more heavy drama aspects of the effects on his family.</p><p>My favorite thing about Journeyman is the excellent theme song. It's a collaboration between UK artist Amanda Ghost and band Rural. It hasn't been released on its own, but they are working on a full version and a single release sometime in the future. ^_^</p><p>Oh well... kinda sucks that its going. Journeyman will appear on DVD some time in the future.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-update">Journeyman Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight is the mid-season finale of Heroes, but unfortunately Journeyman will not be trailing.  Tonight at 9 (10 eastern) an episode of Life will air starting a two-parter to end in its usual timeslot of Wednesday.  Next Monday, Journeyman returns with its Christmas episodes and the next week will contain two episodes ending at half a season.  These two episodes promise to bring some answers as to what is actually going on with Dan's time leaping.</p><p>The internet's mobilization to Save Journeyman begins today!</p><p>What you can do to help save Journeyman is log on to nbc.com and watch episode 10 entitled "Blowback".  In fact, here's a quick link for you: <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml" title="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml">http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml</a>.</p><p>This is the most recent episode of Journeyman and has really been the highlight of the show thus far.  In "Blowback", Dan learns more about the limitations of changing the past and how to fix mistakes when he alters the past beyond his "goal", whether or not his alterations were ethical.</p><p>The goal of this "demostration" is to show that people out there want to watch this show.  A spike in their online ratings should show we care right?</p><div class='title'><b>Quantum Leap</b></div><p>On a side note, one of my friends starting Netflixing Quantum Leap, so we've been watching an episode here and there.  That show is really a trip back in time in itself these days, seeing how it was made back in 1982.  Going back in time even further than that to fix the past makes it very interesting on several levels.</p><p>The shows humor and story are still quite solid to this day.  Definitely check it out, especially if you remember watching that show.  I used to watch that show over and over again when they aired re-runs on USA and the Scifi channel. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman &quot;final&quot; episode will air" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-final-episode-will-air">Journeyman "final" episode will air</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Episode 10 will air on Monday December 10th, followed by Episode 11 on the following Monday.  Episode 12 is placed on Wednesday December 19th at 10/9c.  Not too shabby.  (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>As that article suggested, the decision to air episode 12 came from the caring, passionate support of internet fans, namely those at <a href="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/">SaveJourneyman.net</a>.  Those involved with the site are trying to organize a "Save our Show" campaign similar to what happened with Jericho.</p><p>Earlier this year <a href="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/">Nuts Online .com</a> instituted a campaign called "Nuts for Jericho" where fans contributed money towards a daily shipment of peanuts to CBS New York.  A grand total of $56,968 was spent, totaling over 8 million peanuts.  Check it out: <a href="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho">Nuts for Jericho</a>.</p><p>And it worked!  CBS signed Jericho for a 2nd season.</p><p>It doesn't really look like SaveJourneyman.net is as organized as Nuts for Jericho, but there's plenty of time.. thanks to the strike.  Even though Life and Chuck were renewed, they still need to make those episodes..  If the strike is resolved within this next month, I wonder if they'll try to complete seasons by May..</p><p>hmm... I should probably netflix Jericho to see what all the fuss is about.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to NBC Monday Night updates" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nbc-monday-night-updates">NBC Monday Night updates</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Heroes is really coming down to the wire.  After last week's phenomenal episode, the story continues to build to the fall season finale.  This story arc ends next week, and with that we probably won't see any new episodes of Heroes for a while, due to strike.  With the strike..  episode 11 of Heroes Season 2 is somewhat posed to be the overall season finale. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>Recanting <a href="/old/v7/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman">last week's post</a>, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter (episodes 8 and 9) .. brings big numbers."  I watched both episodes and they were quite good.  I'm almost sad to see the show go.  The plot of Journeyman is really coming together, and the fall finale (two-parter of episodes 11 and 12) bring the plot full circle as it is finally told why Dan is traveling through time.</p><p>Journeyman has 3 episodes left, but won't be airing next week.  Next week, after Heroes, that new cop-drama, Life, will air the beginning of a two-parter to end on its normal timeslot on Wednesday.  The week after is Journeyman's "Christmas episode".  The next Monday after that on December 17th, will be the first episode of the finale, episode 11.  Unfortunately, it seems that episode 12 may not even air according to <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883">Aint it Cool</a>.</p><p>After watching this past week, I'm really quite excited to see what happens, but with the numbers in the toilet, it doesn't seem like Journeyman will even gets its end aired.  But, for those fans out there, Journeyman will be released on DVD will its high-budgeted music soundtrack intact, and including all episodes. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>At this time, NBC has ordered more episodes of Life and that crappy show Chuck, through the rest of their debut seasons...  but Journeyman is still on the chopping block. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>I'd probably like Journeyman more if the episodes followed a stricter plot.  The episodes have been very episodic, giving bits and pieces of the overall plot in each episode.  I'd much rather be absorbed in the story the whole time, like in Heroes and Lost, then you can see everything in the show develop at once.. characters evolve..  plot is continuous.  You never feel like you're wasting your time watching an episode.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>In other news.... Strike</b></div><p>Some of the commercials tonight for new programming beginning in January really makes me feel like the Strike is taking its toll on programming.  Especially with a trailer for the return of <b>American Gladiators</b> to prime-time television, beginning January 7th-ish.  ugh...  I'll probably still watch the premiere episode, though..</p><p>Some good news, though..  Yet another <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897">Aint it Cool</a> article states that the strike could be resolved before Christmas.  Nice! ^_^</p><p>...and just in time for the strike ending, I got my "Support the Strike" cancer bracelets in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071126_wga/100_0946.webp" /></p><p>Lemme know if you'd like a bracelet..

Its Heroes night.  Tonight's Heroes is chapter 9 of the 11 chapter fall season.  The next two weeks will put a cap on the current story arc that supposedly explodes tonight.

To paraphrase, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter airing tonight and next Monday brings big numbers."</p><p>I suppose this would be a good time to talk about Neilson ratings and market share or something else if I actually knew what I were talking about..  I would like to see just how big the viewer difference is between Heroes season 2 and Journeyman.</p><p>Anyways, kiss your ass goodbye Journeyman.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Undeclared" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/undeclared">Undeclared</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 6, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My whole reason for signing up with Netflix was to rent Undeclared.  Undeclared is a TV show that aired on Fox beginning in 2000 and lasting one mere season before being canceled.  Much like other brilliant Fox comedies, we hardly knew ye.</p><div class='title'><b>Premise</b></div><p>Undeclared centers on Steven Karp, new freshman to the University of Northeastern California.  Now in college, Steven is able to shed his geek nature and start a new life.  His roommates are Lloyd, a dashing british exchange student going for a degree in theater, Ron, a business major played by Seth Rogen, and Marshall, a scruffy looking guy working on a music degree despite his parents pushing his into business.</p><p>The first night of college changes Steven's life as he meets Lizzie, a cute girl from across the hall with an overprotective boyfriend at home, played by Jason Segal.  Her roommate is Rachael, whose having her own problems with adjusting to college.</p><p>Each episode attempts to center on a specific topic of adjusting to college life, much like Freaks and Geeks did for High School and home life.</p><div class='title'><b>Interest</b></div><p>Undeclared was created by Judd Apatow, which was the sole purpose for my initial interest in the show.  He also co-created Freaks and Greeks which I've written about before (<a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">here</a> and <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">here</a>).  He's also been chiefly responsible for 40 year old virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad.  All with the underlying theme of Freaks and Geeks..  Freaks being pot heads and burn outs, and Geeks being..  geeks.  Because they follow this pattern, Judd Apatow's properties are full of movie references and drug humor which our generation can easily identify with.</p><p>Undeclared is no different than the rest but really shows Apatow's true calling in his craft.  Don't get me wrong, I think Freaks and Geeks is probably his greatest show to date, but it's too heavy and too real.  I feel so much emotion when watching that show, I'm not sure how more of it I can take..  Undeclared takes a step back from that and focuses more on the comedy.  The comedy floats to the surface and lets the subtle drama aspects govern the plot, but not the scene.</p><p>The Office uses a similar formula.  You come to the show for its comedy, but stay and continue to watch because of the characters and their relationships.  The Office wouldn't work with any other actors playing these characters, and neither would Undeclared.</p><p>Squeezing the show into half an hour really forces the comedy to take center stage too.  There's really no time to build a compelling drama high in such a short time and still make it funny.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>This show is pretty damn hilarious..  Each character and actor complements each other so well..  It makes the show incredibly believable and enjoyable.  Definitely check it out ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Writer's Guild of America on Strike" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/writers-guild-of-america-on-strike">Writer's Guild of America on Strike</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Writer's Guild of America's Contract ended on Halloween and without fair wages and proper benefits to renew their contract, they strike! Which means if this is not resolved in a timely matter, all our favorite shows will see some major hiatus.</p><p>As the article states, Late night shows will be the first to suffer and won't be seen tonight.  Sitcoms and Dramas, such as The Office, 30 Rock, and Heroes have roughly 5 unaired episodes at their disposal, which will keep the shows "new" until the end of November.</p><p>For Lost, lostpedia says that they are in the middle of filming episode 4 of season 4, but with plans to air the show without hiatus, we may see Lost season 4 a bit later than February next year.</p><p>Honestly though, this isn't so bad.  It'll give us a chance to wake up for our television coma, just as we did in the summer months.  We can go outside and enjoy the winter when TV runs out of TV at the end of November.  Plenty of time to start renting TV shows out on DVD.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688">Ain't it cool news</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Office tonight" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-office-tonight">The Office tonight</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Now that they jumped the shark at the end of season 3, I was really wonder what they were going to do with the show..</p><div class='title'><b>Recap</b></div><p>Last season, everyone finally got what they wanted when after 3 season of tickling our assholes, Jim finally made a move to date Pam.  This story arc really began in Season 2 when Jim's feelings  surfaced episode after episode of awkwardness.  At the end Season 2, he finally told her about his love before she married Roy.</p><p>Jim saw this as his last opportunity to profess his feelings before taking a job in New York to get away from these feelings.  Season 3 began rather awkward focusing on Jim in the New York and the regular cast back in the Scranton branch.  Pam had called off the wedding and began searching for what she wanted.  While at the New York branch, Jim started dating fellow co-worker Karen..</p><p>Eventually these two branches became one and bits of drama began to ensue..  Now that Pam was free, it took all season for Jim to realize what he wanted was there, and that Karen was out of desperation.</p><p>6 weeks in, Karen has come back into the show and we find that she's a general manager of her own branch of Dunder Miflin.</p><div class='title'><b>Business Side of things</b></div><p>There are two points of business at work for this show..  There really is no overall story anymore with Jim and Pam together.  They tried to do something with Dwight and Angela, but their characters are as captivating as Jim and Pam.  The same with Michael and Jan.  These romances are more comical than real..  they have their moments, but not enough to carry the show.</p><p>At the same time, NBC's Thursday night line-up has a flat-tire at 8.30pm.  Scrubs is a funny show, but once you've seen a bunch of episodes, you've seen it all.  Except for story elements, you could watch a new episode and swear you've seen it before..  Scrubs will end in May 2008, so what the hell are they going to do to replace it?</p><p>News Article: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619">NBC developing The Office 2</a></p><p>It looks like The Office will be trailing The Office next fall in place of the Scrubs time slot..</p><div class='title'><b>Speculation?</b></div><p>With tonight's episode with Karen managing the Uttica branch of Dunder Miflin..  Is this the beginning of The Office 2?  Will this season start to tear apart itself after season 3 began stitching the cast back together at Scranton?</p><p>This doesn't sound like a particularly great idea..  The Office really works because of its great cast..  finding another cast as balanced and hilarious will not be easy..  I think it would have a LONG way to go without feeling like a complete ripoff.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Heroes Speculation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/heroes-speculation">Heroes Speculation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of last night's episode Hero, the plot for the whole season seemed to emerge.  Especially with the trailer for the next episode.  Peter makes his way to Canada, finds stuff in the helix marked apartment and moves into the future with the irish girl.  They find themselves in downtown New York (against a green screen), where the streets are deserted and full of trash..  A slightly different apocolyptic vision than Hiro saw last season..</p><p>Hiro went into the future twice in season 1.  The first time was a glimpse of New York right before "the bomb" went off.  The second time was a few years after that with New York in ruins and the public going ape-shit after mutants.</p><p>The future that Peter has traveled to shows that by stopping "the bomb" last season, they did INDEED change the future.  I guess we already knew that, though..  The date and time of "the bomb's" explosion had already passed from what it should have been.</p><p>Peter picks up a piece of paper that reads "Evacution, June 2008", which puts them near the date of the final episode of Season 2.  The trailer goes on to say that 93% of the population was killed by a virus.. Most likely, the very virus Mohinder and Bob were talking about earlier to reverse mutants back into normal humans.  Looks like, in the future, Mohinder has failed in suspressing the company from making a virus/vacine..</p><p>It seems like they're following the same pattern from last season.  Catching a glimspe into the future reveals a catastrophic event only they can stop.  Save the cheerleader, Save the world..  what's the tagline going to be this time?  Stop the company, Save the world?  Stop parker's father, save the world?</p><p>I wonder when the first hiatus is....<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/13">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/11">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
