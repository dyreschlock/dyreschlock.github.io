Earlier in the week when getting caught up on "the scene" in Minneapolis, I broadened my search to see what was coming up in Chicago and noticed that Infected Mushroom was down there this weekend.  The one thing I had planned this weekend was canceled, so I thought, "why the hell not?"  I figured that Tony and Erika would want to come with so I invited them along ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Chinatown</b></div><p>One place I've heard about in Chicago is Chinatown.  Erika always mentions Chinatown when the subject of Chicago crops up in conversation.  So we figured that would be an ideal location to visit.  First, we got something to eat since we really hadn't had anything all day and then we took a look around at the area and the shops.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" /></p><p>Chinatown was spread out much more than I thought It was going to be.  I was thinking it would've been cramped together like the one in Nagasaki, or the type of thing you'd see in a Hong Kong action movie.  Thing alley-ways with tons of shops.  There were tons of shops, but it felt like an actual town, rather than a closet.  I guess that's just the American environment at work...  When they first laid the groundwork for Chinatown, they had the room to spread out.  They were confined to a single square block.</p><p>They have some sort of festival coming up on Sunday July 20th sponsored by McDonalds that looks like it'd be fun.  Unfortunately, I'll be in Minneapolis that weekend for my High School Reunion, so that's out.  Maybe next year.</p><p>It'd definitely be neat to check out the other international areas of Chicago in the future.  Erika mentioned a Greek Town and Korea Town..  maybe there's a little Italy in there somewhere.  The one is probably full of mobsters, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Downtown</b></div><p>Afterwards, we hopped back on the trains and went downtown and killed a couple hours walking around and looking for stores that no longer exist.  We came across the still under construction Trump tower that you might know from the first season of the Apprentice.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" /></p><p>They still have a ways to go before they claim the title of tallest building in Chicago, though.  We hung out around the river for quite a while as day turned to dusk turned to night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" /></p><p>We hung out at the two-story museum-like McDonalds for another hour until the doors finally opened up at Visions.</p><div class='title'><b>Visions</b></div><p>It had been a while since the last time I was at Visions.  Actually, I'm not even totally sure when the last time was...  Lemme see..  ah, it was Sasha in 2004.  Luckily, I have all this crap <a href="/old/v7/club" title="/club" title="/club">written down</a>, back when I really cared about it ^_^  2004 was aksi when I started going to fewer clubs...</p><p>Anyways, there was actually a decent line forming in the front of Visions.  People were pretty excited for Infected Mushroom ^_^  It wasn't too long before we got in, but they kept everyone waiting in that extra club that you usually go right through into Visions.  Nope, they had the door shut and a guy posted at the entrance to keep people from actually getting into Visions.  So all of us the fanboy crowd sat in there while we could clearly see others in Visions...</p><p>Oh well, at 11pm the dude opened up the doors and we all piled into Visions.</p><div class='title'><b>Jimmie Page</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" /></p><p>Jimmie Page greeted us into Visions with some fantastic tracks and kept them coming all night long.  The pounding beats built into a mass hysteria of funk and house.  I think I bought a CD of his a couple years ago and it sounded nothing like this.  Honestly, I need to hold reservations on people until I hear them live.  I think that's the true test of quality and ambiance.  Can the performer really resonate with the crowd and build up the set keeping the audience in suspense while still giving them exactly what the want?</p><p>Jimmie Page proved he was that man, and he really blew me away.  I got a demo CD from him too, so I can't wait to listen to that later on. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" /></p><p>Though, the crowd began to slip away from Jimmie with the anticipation of Infected Mushroom and their vacant equipment sitting on the stage opposite of the DJ booth.  Thankfully the fans weren't too rude by chanting "Infected Mushroom" or anything, but they were definitely there for the Mushroom.</p><div class='title'><b>Infected Mushroom</b></div><p>After a 2 1/2 hour set, Jimmie relinquished aural command and all eyes set themselves on the stage where Infected Mushroom was set to go.  The fans went nuts. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" /><br/>I've heard of Infected Mushroom, but never actually heard them previous to this night.  The name made me immediately think of PsyTrance on the order of Hallucinogen and such groups, but I was dead wrong with that classification.  I'm not really sure what sub-sub-genre of Electronica they'd fall into, but they'd definitely be right next to Prodigy on the shelf.  Tony was thinking Hardcore, or, at least, somewhere in that area, which sounds about right.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" /></p><p>Infected Mushroom were fucking incredible, though..  I think they're my new favorite band, ^_^.  For over an hour and a half they keep playing song after song after song and didn't quit.  Bam Bam Bam Bam, like the thunderous body-pounding bass surging into your chest with every beat.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" /></p><p>I don't think I've ever seen a crowd this energetic for anyone.  Most of the DJs or bands I see are mostly low key or if they have a pounding beat are still strung together with a melodic ambiance that is still calming.  Infected Mushroom is constant barrage.  Bam Bam Bam Bam, punching you in the face, in the shoulder.. pushing you around.  Their music has this surge of adrenaline that keeps you moving fist pumping in the air and yelling as loud as you can.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" /></p><p>The night was quite amazing and I'm glad I asked Tony and Erika to come alone with. ^_^  This is the type of thing where'd I usually run off alone and not ask anyone to join me, but I figured they'd be interested in checking it out, at the very least.</p><p>More Pictures can be found here: <a href="/old/v7/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago" title="/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago" title="/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago">http://www.theschlock.com/photo/080622_chicago/</a></p><div class='title'><b>The drive home</b></div><p>Bar curfews very from city to city.  Minneapolis has a curfew that all bars and clubs must close by 3am on a Saturday night.  I think, Madison is 2am..  But Chicago can go all the way to 5am.  Fortunately, Infected Mushroom finished off their encore around 3am, so we didn't stay all that late in the windy city.  I think we got out of downtown and back on the highways around 3:45am or 4am.</p><p>That drive home is always difficult for me because I've just come from this immense loud ear-damaging party, and now must drive for quite a while until I'm finally able to sleep.  I've never made it all the way before..  Usually, I find some motel and sleep in the parking lot for a few hours to muster the energy to finish the trip later or stop off at one of those Oasis McDonalds and buy enough food to keep me busy.  I almost made it to Rockford this time ^_^.  Erika offered to drive the rest of the way to Freeport and Tony drove the rest of the way back to Madison.  We got to watch the sunrise as we trotted along the highways.</p><p>Anywho, today I'm so completely sore.  I feel like I was thoroughly beaten up.  It was really more of love beating, though.  It'll be tough to top last night with the several events that are coming up in the next few months, but they're spread out enough that shouldn't ruin them.  Hopefully I can find something decent in Tampa for the July 4th weekend....<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chuck Palahniuk's Snuff Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">Chuck Palahniuk's Snuff Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Almost a week now, I ran up to Minneapolis in the middle of the work day to catch Chuck Palahniuk at the Triple Rock Social Club.  This was his second stop on his two or three week tour around the US, which came just one day after his new novel, Snuff, was released to the public.  I've been to a few book signings before, but this one was a completely different experience despite, fundamentally, being the same thing.</p><p>The Triple Rock's venue is clearly a music venue.  The elevated stage overlooks a sizable dancing pit-like area with a lounge area surrounding it and there's a bar in the back to pick up drinks.  Unlike the book signings I've been to before, it was standing room only, minus a couple of tables of chairs here and there.  The place was setup as if some band was about the crash the stage and everyone would rock along and, quite honestly, that's pretty much what happened.</p><p>After Chuck signed a bunch of books at the front, the moderator of the venue got up on stage and introduced him.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" /></p><p>He greeted the crowd and laid out the events for the rest of the evening.  Chuck introduced Don Pollack to the stage and Don began to read from his book, Knockemstiff.  The vibe of the audience was quite the same of any book reading.  Everyone was quite polite and gave Don their ears.  However, the tone and content of the book sent the audience into a joyous hysteria.  The book was pretty funny, and no one held back any laughter.</p><p>Afterwards, Chuck took the stage again and began to read a short story he'd written, Loser, which he has no plans to publish.  The atmosphere erupted again with laughter, hanging off of each word Chuck spoke.  The excitement and joy of the crowd really elevated the story and brought it to life.</p><p>That atmospheric involvement worked incredibly well with Chuck's writing style.  Chuck's writing is always in first person and illustrates the characters thoughts and emotions thoroughly and comically.  I really feel like I'm inside the character's head and can understand his motives and reasons for doing what they do.  And experiencing it within the same bubble as everyone else, and being on the same page is a very collective feeling.</p><p>The variety of poeple that came to this event was far from homogeneous, yet through the brunt dark reality of Loser we're all connected.  I think it takes a certain personality to really thoroughly enjoy Chuck's writing, a dark honest side we can relate to but never live..  and it's interesting seeing all the people that probably feel the same way and how they look just like anyone you'd ever meet.</p><div class='title'><b>Aside from the readings...</b></div><p>Anyways, aside from the readings, Chuck interspersed a few games between the night's events.  The game, which we played twice, we see how fast you could inflate blow-up dolls that he through into the audience.  Winner's of the game would receive a copy of Don's book, Knockemstiff.  I have some pretty decent lungs, but the people in the front row were just a little bit quicker.</p><p>After the games, Chuck held a Q&A session, where most of the questions came from the moderator :rolls eyes:.  Thankfully, the questions weren't really all that bad.  For each little question she asked, Chuck really owned the answer and brought it back to something that was probably rehearsed.</p><p>He said that he really isn't that big a talker, but he loves to listen to people.  He listens on how they talk about others.. and how they're really talking about themselves.  When you're talking about another person, you're really describing yourself through them.  You elevate and highlight what emotions you feel when you think of them, whether it's good or bad, and paint a separate picture of them that's distinct from who they actually are.</p><p>I found this interesting because that's exactly how his recent novels are written, contrary to his early novels which were the opposite.  All of his first novels centered on a single character and you read from their point of view the entire book.  Everything was first-person and about you.  Actually, Diary was the first one that really changed this pattern where he tried to write in third-person, but from the first-person perspective of some one else.</p><p>In my opinion, Rant was his first success in writing this way.  Rant had the first-person perspective of many people focusing on the third-person view of a single character.  Snuff is laid out the same way, but I haven't read it yet to fully comment on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Free Stuff</b></div><p>He also spoke about using props within the context of the book to keep the characters centered, and always bring the reader back to a point or theme.  Themes are pretty good for describing and flushing out characters, but I think using props to enforce those themes is a little too obvious.  Like having flowers for a symbol of love..</p><p>Chuck said that Snuff has several props throughout the book, two of which were a blow-up doll and an autograph hound.  He had already thrown a bunch of blow-up dolls into the audience for the games, but he had several garbage bags full of autograph hounds he gave to the crowd as another thank you for coming. ^_^</p><p>Luckily, I'm tall, so catching all this stuff above the crowd is pretty easy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" /></p><p>Also, every participant of the reading got a pre-signed copy of the Snuff novel with a Choke bookmark.  The bookmark has a rather symbolic prop from Choke attached to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Choke</b></div><p>Speaking of Choke, we were also treated to the Trailer for the Choke movie which comes out in theaters this coming September.  Choke is Chuck's third novel, and the movie has been "in the works" for the past 8 years.  The initial movie rights were sold a year after Fight Club came out in theaters.</p><p>The Trailer is online today, and you can find it <a href="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956" title="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956" title="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956">HERE</a>, at MTV's website.  It'd probably be the first movie I've ever seen where I've actually read the book FAR in advance of the movie's release.  I should probably read it again before September.<br/>____</p><p>Anywho, I had a great time ^_^ and hopefully next time I'll hear about tickets far in advance, so I can get some more of my books signed by him.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Speed Racer is Amazing" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/speed-racer-is-amazing">Speed Racer is Amazing</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I think the Wachowski brother nailed the intensity of racing with the fast paced cuts and transitions of Anime and lit everything together with THE most brilliant and vibrant colors I've ever seen it a movie.</p><p>I think it's one of the few movies to actually bring live action elements into the cartoon world, rather bringing its characters into the real world.  I reminds me a lot of Dick Tracy and The Flintstones, rather than Batman or Spiderman.  The characters and their environment are completely in sync, rather than some goofy cartoon logic in our own world.</p><p>Critics seem to be pissed about this though saying the movie is sensory overload disconnected from reality.  That's exactly what it is.  What did you think it was going to be?  How is that fact a downfall?  Critics are killing this movie in the same way they did with Matrix Reloaded.  They expect one thing... and get something else.</p><p>Honestly, I think when the Wachowskis ground themselves in reality, the results are horrible.. like V for Vendetta.</p><p>Unfortunately, the critics get their way since Speed Racer flopped taking in only $20.2 million this weekend, a percentage compared to Iron Man's opening $100 million weekend and another $50 million this weekend.</p><p>I loved every minute of this minute and can't wait to see it again.  Next time, it'll be at the Imax.  If you hate the movie because its crazy, then you're too old.</p><p>Also, I'm disapointed in Mathew Fox.  He has absolutely no acting range and will always be known as Jack from Lost.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 2008 Summer Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/2008-summer-movies">2008 Summer Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This summer is huge for movies and there are a bunch I'm particularly interested in.<br/>___</p><p>April 18th - <b>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</b><br/><a href="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/" title="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/" title="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/">Imdb</a></p><p>Written and Starring Jason Segal, one of the vets from Apatow Productions, plays opposite Kristen Bell who break up in the beginning of the movie and Segal goes to great lengths to forget her and fails miserable.  The ads on TV don't really paint this movie in a fantatic light, but that was the same for Knocked Up and Superbad.  I guess we'll see.<br/>___</p><p>May 2nd - <b>Iron Man</b><br/><a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/" title="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/" title="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Imdb</a><br/>___</p><p>May 9th - <b>Speed Racer</b><br/><a href="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/" title="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/" title="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/">Imdb</a></p><p>I've been hyped up for this movie ever since I saw the first images and trailer.  This is the kind of movie that hype lends rather well because you know exactly what to expect from it.  Sweet sweet eye candy.  Speed Racer looks absolutely amazing, full of vibrant colors and life, fast paced action in a very anime style.  And with the wachowski brothers at the helm, this movie won't fail at those points.</p><p>I have no doubts the story will be utter crap, acting may be poor, and the whole family-centered attitude will constantly annoy me, but the action will probably make up for it.  I'm psyched.<br/>___</p><p>May 22nd - <b>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</b><br/><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html" title="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html" title="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/">Imdb</a><br/>___</p><p>June 13th - <b>The Incredible Hulk</b><br/><a href="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/" title="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/" title="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/">Imdb</a></p><p>I dunno... I'll probably see this movie if other people are going.  The previous Hulk movie was rather horrible, but this new Hulk stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner.  That along makes it worth viewing, in my opinion.<br/>___</p><p>July 2nd - <b>Hancock</b><br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/" title="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/" title="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/">Imdb</a></p><p>Hancock looks absolutely hilarious.  Will Smith plays a bum with super-powers and doesn't care about the damage caused by "Saving the Day".  Eventually Will Smith runs into Jason Bateman who tries to reabilitate him into a stereotypical do-gooder.  Or something like that.  Check out the trailer.<br/>___</p><p>July 18th - <b>The Dark Knight</b><br/><a href="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/" title="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/" title="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">Imdb</a></p><p>The long-time hyped sequel to Batman Begins and the "remake" of the original 1989 Batman movie, pits Batman versus The Joker.  huzzah.<br/>___</p><p>August 8th - <b>Pineapple Express</b><br/><a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/pineappleexpress/index.html" title="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/pineappleexpress/index.html" title="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/pineappleexpress/index.html">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910936/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910936/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910936/">Imdb</a></p><p>Written and Starring Seth Rogan who plays a regular old guy buying some pot from dealer James Franco when they witness a murder.  Then the murderers are after Seth and James and they cops think they did it, so they're being chased by everyone while trying to clear their names.<br/>___</p><p>August 28th - Chuck Palahniuk's <b>Choke</b><br/><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt1024715/" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt1024715/" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt1024715/">Imdb</a></p><p>Really?  Is this movie really finally coming out?  Imdb has some pretty slick character photos of the cast so that's some great signs that this might actually finally come out.</p><p>It's been 9 years since Fight Club hit theaters and became an instant cult classic.  Fight Club made me a huge fan of Chuck Palahniuk, and Choke was the first book I read of his.  I'm very excited to see if Choke will bring some more amazing things to film like what Fight Club brought.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha &amp; Digweed @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">Sasha &amp; Digweed @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last night, I went up to Minneapolis to check out Sasha and Digweed on tour together for the first time in 6 years.  The last time, they brought the sounds of Delta Heavy throughout North America and the rest of the world.  This year, they're starting off the Spring season of clubbing the very same way.</p><p>In Minneapolis, they came to Epic, which everyone in Minneapolis would know formerly as The Quest.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting to Minneapolis</b></div><p>As most of you know, near the end of 2007 I smashed my car and have been making use of public transportation rather than buying a new one.  This works out pretty good for getting around madison, but making it outside of madison can be difficult.  Since I couldn't find anyone to go on a work night, I had to do a little investigating into the cheapest way to travel 300 miles north by north-west.</p><p>I settled on taking a fancy greyhound bus since it was super-cheap.  It cost $88 round-trip and took 5.5 hours.  That's almost cheaper than driving actually, since it was always take me almost 2 tanks of gas to get there and back.  PLUS, now I can sleep on the way up and have plenty of energy for the club.</p><p>The greyhound station in minneapolis was only a few blocks away from Epic, so this was a very very lucrative offer.  Unfortunately, I waited until the night before to buy the tickets, so I had to get to the station in Madison earlier than I would've liked to redeem my tickets.</p><p>It wasn't half bad...  Though, I got to Epic about half an hour early, so I sat outside until the doors opened.  The "line" was rather disappointing.  6 years ago when waiting outside of the same place half an hour early on a work night, the line stretched along the sidewalk to the edge of the building.  Today, around the same time, I was the only one that made up the line.  Rather sad, if you ask me, but it didn't that long for people to show up after I did.</p><div class='title'><b>Epic</b></div><p>Over half an hour later, music finally began to seep through the open doors and crawl into the streets like a mist.  After trying to figure out when we were going to get in, the music acted as a starting bell as we jumped off our marks and filed inside.</p><p>Epic was actually pretty nice.  It had been almost 3 years since the last time I stepped into the quest and that was when they shoveled James Holden up into the back room, rather than the main stage.  You could still tell it was the quest, but they made some very nice changes to the place to make it more accessible.</p><p>Changes such as flattening all of the first floor to the same level, rather than having a raised dance floor and a fenced off area in the back.  They also chucked all the chairs and tables on the ground floor, and had very few tables here and there for standing.  They took out a little bit of the balcony facing the stage and put in a stair-case right in the middle of the club, rather than going through the back room.  All those crappy TVs are gone and replaced with flat screens.  Nearly all the walls glow and change colors with the rest of the lights.</p><p>The Quest went through a huge makeover thanks to the new management.  Epic is still very much The Quest, but with much more than just a new coat of paint.  Plus that scafolding is no longer hugging the front of the building.  That's a huge plus.  There's still some road construction out front, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Kazel</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" /></p><p>The night began with the very solid sounds of Kazel.  He did an excellent job of setting the tone for the evening. I don't really remember most of his set because of what was to come after, but I was never bored during his time.  It built to the suspense and excitement of Sasha and Digweed.</p><p>At the same time, I was amusing myself with some of the crowd members.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" /></p><p>One of the most beautiful things of the evening, were the visuals up on the stage.  It was fitted with tons and tons of LED lights, which formed something simliar to a Jumbotron screen right in front of us.  The visuals used on these LEDs were stylistic 2D graphics in a 3D space.  Mostly shapes moving around and different colors, whee!  It was quite pretty.0</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha and Digweed</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" /></p><p>After plenty of time to build a massive crowd, Sasha and Digweed took over the stage, finished up Kazel's last track, and Sasha began his sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" /></p><p>Sasha took the point position with Abelton.  Unlike Delta Heavy or previous Sasha and Digweed collaborations, this was pure Sasha.  He has evolved passed fundacion, but it's still very similar.

| February 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Over the weekend, the WGA and the AMPTP have finally agreed on a contract and tonight, the members of the WGA will vote to accept this contract, END the strike, and return to work on Wednesday morning.  Good News ^_^.  This contract succeeds at getting writers a fair shake at internet reruns and new form of media, but really screws over writers for reality TV shows.  It's rather interesting how much actual television and movie writers look down upon reality TV writers.  Actually, what I find most interesting is that reality TV shows have writers.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 Saved</b></div><p>Anyways, with the strike ending ABC has picked up 9 series for the coming fall season.  LOST, of course, is on that list. ^_^.  Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof have wasted no time with the end of the strike near, to announce they have plans to finish Season 4 the way it was intended.</p><p>Originally, Season 4 and subsequent seasons, have been slated for 16 total episodes, but with the strike, Season 4 had only 8 episodes completed.  Cuse has stated today that they are going to push out another 5 episodes to complete all the Season 4 story arcs and finish it correctly (<a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574">aint it cool</a>).  Good News, indeed ^_^</p><p>So far, Season 4 has rather interesting.  At the beginning of Seasons 2 and 3, we began from the point of view outside of the cast, in the eyes of whom the largest mystery was in the previous season.  That didn't happen this time.  In fact, it did finally happen in episode 2 of season 4.  Episode 1 felt more like an extension of the Season 3 ending, but still introduced new topics for Season 4.</p><p>I felt episode 2 was kinda flat, but episode 1 was pretty slick.  Keep 'em coming ^_^</p><p>Another little bit of news, thanks to the "enhanced" episode of the Season 3 finale, and the "catch up" episode prior to the season premiere, Lost Season 4 Episode 1 netted 16.1 million viewers: one of their highest viewer turnouts in the series history.  The highest point was 18 million, i think, for some episode in season 1.</p><div class='title'><b>More TV</b></div><p>Just as a reminder, <b>Jericho</b> Season 2 premieres tonight on CBS, though you can download episodes 1, 2, and 3 on the internet if you don't want to wait.  These 3 episodes pretty much confirm my feelings towards the series.  Great characters, great entertainment, but the whole "mystery" has pretty much been revealed.  The intrigue of the series now is watching to see what happens.</p><p>Also on CBS, <b>Dexter</b> Season 1 begins this coming Sunday in its full edited form.  It's a great show, but cutting out all the death and blood in a show that is built on death and blood doesn't sound like a great move.  If you haven't seen Dexter, definitely check it out ^_^.  Hopefully, they've done a professional editing job.</p><p>Along-side Dexter on NBC is the 2 hour premiere of the new <b>Knight Rider</b> series.  This is a direct sequel to David Hasslehoff TV classic.  <a href="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html" title="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html" title="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html">Here's a sneak Peak</a>.

| January 6, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>One week ago, Aint it cool posted a defacto list of <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35177" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35177" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35177">spring season premieres</a>, which contains the dates of 3 shows I care about: Lost, Jericho, and Sarah Connor Chronicles.  All Dates that I previously <a href="/old/v7/television-next-year" title="/television-next-year" title="/television-next-year">wrote about</a>.  Those Dates again are...</p><p>Sarah Connor Chronicles (Terminator) Series Premiere, Fox, Sunday January 13th<br/>LOST Season 4, ABC, Thursday January 31st<br/>Jericho Season 2, CBS, Tuesday February 12th</p><p>The other day Aint it cool posted a very similar list that detailed <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35192" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35192" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35192">spring season finales</a>, which were much different than i thought they would be.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4</b></div><p>Lost begins on Jan 31st and ends on Mar 20th.  That's a mere 8 episodes compared to the scheduled 16 episodes.  I guess the 8 episodes that were completed before the strike is it..  they didn't finish off the rest of the series whether it was written or not.  They halved it.  Just like Heroes, and every other show that started back in September.</p><p>No wonder Cruse and Lindelof think the season "ender" isn't as powerful as previous seasons..  It'll probably parallel the first 6 episodes of Season 3 over a year ago.  "Here's a taste of this Season.. and you won't get the rest until later."  Of course, with Season 3 they wanted to hold off until all the episodes were complete and they could air without hiatus.  The strike paints a much different reason for hiatus.</p><p>I'm somewhat concerned about the future of Lost if the entire Season 4 is a mere 8 episodes...</p><p>Towards the end of Season 3, the creators of Lost states that Lost has an ending.  Lost was set to end with 6 seasons total, with 16 episodes in each of its remaining seasons.  I'm not sure how strong those set of previous facts were...  if there is a contract behind that or...</p><p>What are these 8 episodes..?  Are these 8 episodes all of Season 4 or are these the first half?   and will we get the remaining 40 episodes that were intended to follow..  are those 40 episodes scaled down to 32 now?</p><p>If these 8 episodes fall flat, is Lost, as a series, in trouble..?  Is Lost cancellable?  God I hope not...</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho Season 2</b></div><p>Speaking of cancellable..  Jericho Season 2 is literally Jericho's second chance as a series.</p><p>Over the Christmas break, I watched all 22 episodes of the first season and I'm hooked..  Jericho presents itself very much like Lost and the story of Jericho perpetuates it beautifully.  The difference is that Jericho has split nearly all its mysteries by the end of Season 1.  At that end of the season, I'm more concerned with what is going to happen than what is happening.</p><p>In Lost, they keep the important mysteries floating around and unsolved so you continue to speculate.  Each season finale of Lost posts a significant milestone in the series.  Some huge event occurs that dramatically alters the story, the final missing piece of a puzzle is revealed, and is topped off with a cliffhanger giving the direction of the next season.</p><p>The entire first season of Jericho continued to escalate and escalate.  The writers basically threw everything into the fire to keep it burning as bright as possible..  but a brilliant fire burns twice as bright, half as long.  Season 1 is a fantastic ride, but I really don't have the ambition to watch it over again.  Once Season 4 of Lost is complete, I'll probably start the series all over again at episode 1, but would I do the same with Jericho?</p><p>ANYWAYS...  Jericho Season 2 begins on Feb 12th and ends March 25th..  only 7 episodes.  This is Jericho's final test for the market.  If these 7 episodes don't get the ratings...</p><p>I dunno...  I am skeptical...  Jericho is pretty well laid out at this point...  we just need to wait and see what happens.</p><div class='title'><b>Sarah Connor Chronicles</b></div><p>On the other hand we have a completed new show: Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which takes place 2 years after Terminator 2..  several years still prior to Terminator 3.  I guess this story will show just what happened to Sarah Connor in between those movies and show how John Connor learned to trust her vision of the future.</p><p>This kinda screws up the beautiful chronological space the movies shared.. Terminator 1, 2 and 3 happened in 1984, 1991, and 2003, respectively..  both when the movies were released and when the events in the Terminator timeline happen..  In fact, Terminator 4 is slated for 2009..  6 years into the machine war. ^_^</p><p>Oh well, a little side story filling in the important gaps in a different medium can bend the rules a little bit.</p><p>Keep in mind that in Terminator 2, they machine war break out was supposed to occur in 1997, but in Terminator 3 it came full circle that you cannot change the future... only delay it.  In this case, the delay was 6 years, and the Sarah Connor Chronicles should reveal more of how this delayed..  or perhaps how it was inevitably set to ignite in 2003.</p><p>I really really wonder how well the Sarah Connor Chronicles will stick to the chronology of the series.  2 years after Terminator 2 is 1993..  Are we going to see 1993 objects?  or 2007-8 continuity errors..</p><p>On last thing to note is that the good terminator, previously played by Arnold, is played by Summer Glau, famously known by geeks as River Tam of Firefly and Serenity.  She's really the show's biggest star too...  unless you count the Terminator branding, which will be the main, if not only reason people would bother watching this show.</p><p>ANYWAYS..  Sarah Connor Chronicles begins next Sunday Jan 13th, and continues on Monday Jan 14th to its normal timeslot.  It will continue 8 weeks until March 3rd, spanning 9 episodes.  Odd that IMDB has 12 episodes listed.</p><p>I'm definitely going to check it out next Sunday ^_^..

| December 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Last night my little brother and I caught a movie at one of our local theaters, the Eden Praire Mall. It was a real heartwarming tale, but there were two things that really distracted me about the movie that kept me away from feeling the raw emotion so many women in the audience felt.</p><div class='title'><b>Synopsis</b></div><p>Juno is about a young girl (Ellen Page) named Juno. She is sixteen years ago and has found out that she is pregnant after having sex for the first time with her boyfriend (Michael Cera). She realizes that she can't possibly care for the child herself and she toys with the idea of abortion but can't go through with it. So she turns to adoption and finds a couple Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and her husband (Jason Bateman).</p><p>By the partial cast listing, it's pretty easy to see why I wanted to see this movie. I was very interested in seeing Michael Cera and Jason Bateman in serious roles outside of their type-cast roles they've been in since Arrested Development. To their character, they still were Michael and George Michael, but they acted great in their moments of seriousness. I hope they find more roles like this in the future, so I can see more of their acting ability. ^_^ I'll settle for their hilarious comedic character though..</p><p>Tangent: Both have movies coming out, by the way.. Michael Cera will return in Apatow's Year One sometime in 2009, while Michael Cera will support Will Smith in Hancock July 2008.</p><div class='title'><b>Distraction #1</b></div><p>Anyways, these two nagging distractions really only apply to me. One thing that really pissed me off was this searing pain in my neck I had ever since I woke up in the morning. I mean, it was like someone hammered a nail right into my spine in the base of my neck .. The pain was almost paralyzing. I'm actually quite reliefed that I can move today. That and I was so monsterously sick the past two days.. ugh. but Hurrah.. i'm in better health today!</p><p>Unfortunately, the nagging pain was the main emotion I felt which really drew away any overwhelming happiness the vast amount of the female audience felt due to their constant sniffling and "awwww honey, hold me" sentiment.</p><div class='title'><b>Distraction #2</b></div><p>The other thing that nagged me a bit was their location in the movie. From the beginning, it looked like Juno lived in any normal rural town. The first name drop was given by Michael Cera's character when he mention his friend or brother went to <i>Mankato</i> for college. That was a big flag.. 'Mankato? As in Mankato State in Mankato, MN?'.. hmm..</p><p>My suspicions were confirmed with Juno gave the next name drop when she talked about some girl tearing off all her clothes and jumping into the fountain at <i>Ridgedale</i> mall. Bingo.. I knew it. West Suburbs of Minneapolis.. where I grew up. The mission became to figure out exactly where Juno lived in the movie.</p><p>Well.. that's where the location kinda falls apart. A couple times in the movie Juno drives out to see the adopting parents who live in a rich suburb entitled <i>Glacial Valley Estates</i>, which is later identified as residing in <i>St. Cloud</i>, an <i>hour and a half</i> away. OK, so if Juno goes to ridgedale often and St. Cloud is an hour and a half away, then she probably lives in Plymout, Maple Grove or whatever cities are in between there.</p><p>What screws up this theory is Juno's Step-mom says "why the hell would go the East Jesus out there" when talking about St. Cloud. Ridgedale is in Plymouth which is directly West of Minneapolis and Maple Grove is directly North of St. Cloud. To go to St. Cloud from Ridgedale, you'd take 494 to Maple Grove and continue along I-94 to St. Cloud, which is directly North-West of Maple Grove. There's nothing East Jesus about it.</p><p>For St. Cloud to be East anything of Juno's house it would take her around 3 hours to get to Ridgedale, and the scene where Juno just happens to run into Vanessa AT Ridgedale makes absolutely no sense. Well.... nevermind, I guess it could make sense if it were a Satuday or Sunday. I guess North-west-wise Ridgedale is the best mall option.. both Northern malls are crap. well, Northdale is probably remodeled by now, but its difficult to get to and further away than Ridgedale.</p><p>Anyways, that was bothering me the whole movie. I'm glad I went to go see this movie with my little brother because if I saw this with anyone in Madison or from school, they would have been constantly annoyed with me talking to myself trying to slooth their location. In fact, the woman sitting next to my little brother kept telling me to shut up with her evil eye.</p><p>Later on, you get full view of their high school's name: "Dancing Elk High School", which I'm fairly certain doesn't exist.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't have Internet here so I can't really check up on anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Anyways, Juno is fantastic. It's comedy-style has a very Napoleon Dynamite spin, but thank god the characters don't act that way. It's extremely heartwarming, powerful, funny.. It's really great. Definitely check it out.</p><p>Thankfully I got their nagging distractions out of the way the first time I saw it, so when I see it again and show it to people I'm not constantly talking during the film.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Television next year" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/television-next-year">Television next year</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This week is the last week for new TV.  Most shows have already finished, but "last to cross the finish line" new show <b>Journeyman</b> finally makes it in with Episode 11 tonight at 9pm central and Episode 12 on Wednesday at 9pm central.</p><div class='title'><b>Journeyman Finale</b></div><p>These final two episodes finally explain how Dan Vassar has been traveling through time answering that Lingering question.  Although with the end of the series, due to poor ratings, we are missing out on the bigger question of why Dan is traveling through time.  Series creator Kevin Falls has said that if the show had continued the season finale would have put all of Dan's time traveling into perspective.  Each leap through time is meant to align time in such a way to make an event happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, Journeyman was too slow and too disjointed to give this impression starting off.  If the audience would have realized Dan's time traveling was important, I think they would have much more viewers.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>January 2008</b></div><p>With Journeyman's finale 2007 ends, but despite the writer's continued strike, Late Night TV will return in January with or without their writers.  Specifically The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  Both shows will return and air new episodes beginning Wednesday January 2nd.</p><p>Both Leno and O'Brien have been huge supporters of the strike.  Their return is to start supporting their non-writing staff who have been laid off during these last two months of reruns.</p><p>David Letterman, on the other hand, is attacking the situation differently.  Letterman is attempting to strike an interim deal between Studio Execs and the WGA so when he returns on January 2nd, he'll have his writers.</p><p>Interesting developments..  The below linked article also suggests some alternative programming for Leno and Conan in lew of their monologue.  They might have more guests to fill in the time...</p><p>(source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A">New York times</a>)</p><div class='title'><b>February 2008</b></div><p>Besides Late Night returning, there are 2 amazing TV shows which return in the Spring that we haven't seen since their finales back in May..  Lost and Jericho.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 - Thursday January 31st, 8pm Central</b></div><p>On Friday, the Lost Season 4 trailer flew across the Internet and made many people happy.  Here it is, in case you missed it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho</a></p><p>At first I was baffled..  "really?  It's still coming out despite the strike?  Last I heard, they only completed 8 of the 16 episodes before November 1st."  Later in the day, Aint it cool <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076">reported</a> on the return of Lost stating that January 31st will be the beginning.</p><p>Upon further inspection, it looks they finished up Season 4 without the writers..  I mean, all the scripts were written before the strike began, but the writers are VERY involved with each episode as they make it.  They are always on hand to guide and shape each episode to fit their perfect vision.  They completed 8 episodes this way before the strike, so the final 8 episodes were done without the personal touch, which doesn't bode well.</p><p>Aint it Cool states that Showrunners Carlton Cruse and Damon Lindelof think the season finale is weak compared to previous Seasons.  That's rather pessimistic.</p><p>Lost Season 4 is 16 episodes which will air week after week without break.  I don't know if the season premiere and finale count as 2 each..  probably not.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho</b></div><p>Over the weekend, I caught my first glimpse of Jericho and my god..  this show is pretty damn awesome.  It's a lot like Lost except it hits real close to home..  I don't want to give away any of the story, though.</p><p>I went into Jericho episode 1 completely blind.  I had no idea what Jericho is, what is was about, or who was even in it.  All I knew is that the Internet saved this show and that people love it.  The first couple minutes of the show were pretty stereotypically, but when that climax music began to seep into the opening and you could absolutely tell that at any moment the plot of the entire show was going to hit...  I even said outloud.. "whatever is about to happen is going to make me love this show.. I just know it.."</p><p>then BAM...  I am an instant fan of this show.  It was totally engaging and made me want to watch every single episode after.</p><p>Jericho Season 1 has been out on DVD since October, so you can definitely netflix it..  OR you can watch every single episode of Jericho on the CBS website.  Yeah, it's crappy quality and Yeah, they have advertisements, but it'll give you a taste and, personally, a taste is all I needed.</p><p>Here's a quick link to all the episodes on cbs.com: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261" title="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261" title="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261</a></p><p>If you really want to give yourself they perfect experience, Netflix the first DVD, put in it your player, turn up the sound, and turn off the lights.  You'll be on the edge of your seat.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho Season 2 - Tuesday February 12th, 9pm Central</b></div><p>Anyways, thanks to the Internet, Jericho has been saved from cancellation and CBS has ordered 8 more episodes.  If all goes well with the ratings, CBS will order the rest of the season and probably more to come ^_^.</p><p>Much like Lost and other shows, these 8 episodes were surely completed before the strike, so they should be magnificent.</p><div class='title'><b>Other shows</b></div><p>For now, that's really all I can foresee coming to TV.  Some episodes of The Office, 30Rock and Earl were completely before the strike, so those couple episodes will probably air here and there in the spring..</p><p>In the meantime though...  enjoy winter!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End of Journeyman" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-of-journeyman">End of Journeyman</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>On Monday, episode 10 of Journeyman aired and without Heroes to bring viewers to NBC on Monday Nights, the show didn't do so hot. Yesterday was NBC's deadline to secure the show for a second-half, but they passed on it, which means the cast is free to look for work elsewhere and has no obligation to continue working on the show. Balls..</p><p>This doesn't mean NBC can't renew the show.. They can do so at anytime. SaveJourneyman.Net is still holding on hope of renew. With the writer's strike there will certainly be a sharp decline of pilot episodes for the coming spring, so why not renew the show.. You aren't going to have anything new to show otherwise?</p><p>SaveJourneyman's compaign continues, though. Much like the Nuts for Jericho campaign, they are sending boxes of Rice-a-Roni to the studio executives along with letters from the future.</p><p>The most-likely final episodes of Journeyman will air on Monday and Wednesday next week and hope to answer some of the reasons why Dan is time-traveling and what is actually going on. They should have answered these questions much sooner. It would have made the show more interesting and plot heavy, rather than focusing on the more heavy drama aspects of the effects on his family.</p><p>My favorite thing about Journeyman is the excellent theme song. It's a collaboration between UK artist Amanda Ghost and band Rural. It hasn't been released on its own, but they are working on a full version and a single release sometime in the future. ^_^</p><p>Oh well... kinda sucks that its going. Journeyman will appear on DVD some time in the future.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/media/12">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/media/10">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
