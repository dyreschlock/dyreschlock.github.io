| March 15, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>How long ago was Evangelion 1.0 released in theaters?  I think it was around July 2007, wasn't it?  Even so, it's been out for a while.  And you'd think a die hard, unapologetic Evangelion fan such as myself would have seen it by now.  But I have not.  I guess I thought I was going to have or attend some big group watching Party with friends to see the rebirth, but that never happened.  At this point, I figured that the North American Bluray release would finally be the time I'd see it.  Funimation is releasing it in November 2009.</p><p>Anyways, this weekend was the first free weekend I've had for a while now.  So far on this lazy Saturday my accomplishments include: Watching the 5 most recent episodes of Late Night w/ Jimmy Fallon and sleeping on and off for about 12 or 14 hours.  As I ran out of Jimmy Fallon episodes to watch and read Eva fans going nuts over <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65" title="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65">Asuka's name change</a>, I thought about finally watching Evangelion 1.0.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 1: Finding a torrent</b></div><p>Finding a torrent for Evangelion 1.0 wasn't too difficult.  Though, my choices of which torrent to use was varied and confusing.  I finally picked one that had a decent amount of seeders and looked like an English language version.  It took about an hour or two to download.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 2: Playing the movie</b></div><p>The file I downloaded was a Matroska (MKV) file.  One of those ridiculous video formats that Anime geeks like because you can swap out subtitle files at your whim.  I thought I had means to play MKV files, but Media Player and DivX Player informed me that this was not the case.  <a href="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html" title="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html">Matroska dot Org</a> had the answers for me.  I downloaded a copy of Media Player Classic, and the video played perfectly. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 3: Subtitles</b></div><p>The torrent was kind enough to provide only the movie file.  So, when Shinji listened to the phone recording in the first moments of the film, it was in Japanese without the aid of subtitles.  It only took about 10 minutes of searching on Google to find a subtitle file.  (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf" title="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf">http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf</a>).  I opened up Evangelion 1.0 in Media Player Classic, set the subtitle file, and prepared to watch.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 4: Correcting the Subtitle file</b></div><p>Not every video file of Evangelion 1.0 is the same.  Some are recorded from a Camcorder in the theater.  Some are directly ripped from the DVD release.  Whatever the case, my copy of Evangelion 1.0 has about 32 seconds of Company IDs at the beginning before the film actually begins, which the subtitle file doesn't take into account.  So, Subtitles start to appear 32 seconds before any dialogue is said.</p><p>The whole beauty of the MKV format is that you can make your own subtitle files.  The subtitles aren't hardcoded on the video.  You can edit them.  So, I'll just fix the subtitle file by changing every time in it.  I'd do it by hand, except there are over 1000 lines of dialogue to change.  I could write a program much faster than I could do fix by hand.  Plus, it would be much more interesting.</p><p>So, that's what I did.  Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java">github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/EvaSubtitleFixer.java</a>.  If you want to use it, feel free. ^_^  You might want to change the ORIGINAL_LOCATION to whatever your subtitle file is called.  And change OFFSET_BY_SECONDS to however many seconds your subtitle file is off.  It'll plop a file called subtitles_fixes.srt in your C directory.</p><p>I guess this'll really only work with Subtitle files of the srt format.  I'm not sure how the other subtitle formats are designed.  I just took one look at the SRT file and figured out the pattern instantly.</p><p><i>Update: I wrote that code in a web application, so you can use it right now without needing any compilers or experience or whatever.  The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a></p><div class='title'><b>Success</b></div><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-2">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's quite incredible. The suspense is perfectly controlled leading to the finale. It builds from the little bits of plot and story peppered in the beginning and gradually mounting an explosion in the end.</p><p>Season 2 really doesn't quite compare. Though, it tries to do the same thing. And has a pretty decent starting point with the aftermath of Season 1. It does a great job of building off the previous season and builds a story of its own, which also leads to a great ending. Unfortunately, the main focus is split.</p><p>Season 1 has a very clear focal point that everything centers on. There are 2 main plots that eventually weave together into one. Season 2 has a focal point, but there is too much plot. And just a little bit of story. Thankfully it's masked but consistant suspense.</p><p>Season 2 is still decent, but Season 1 is great.</p><p>Don't talk to me about Season 3.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Day The Earth Stood Still" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-day-the-earth-stood-still">The Day The Earth Stood Still</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month I've been sitting on the first two Blurays of the Terminator television program, Sarah Connor Chronicles.  I think the Xbox is largely to blame for that, but I finally switched back to my Playstation 3 and started watching.</p><p>Honestly, I think this show is pretty dumb.  The humor solely relies on Summer Glau acting inhuman because she's a robot.  And the show comes off as shallow because it relies too much on the action which isn't all that good because it has a Television show budget.  The humor and the action try way too hard to live up to Terminator 2.</p><p>And the unforgivable plot device used in the pilot episode completely breaks the mythos of Terminator.  YOU CANNOT travel forward in time.  Only backwards.  I'm sure fanboys were completely up in arms on the Internet after that aired.  Messing around with time is a dangerous plot device that I think Terminator skirted by only allowing backwards time travel.</p><p>Even after that travesty, I continued watching the show because...  well, I had the discs and wanted to return them to Netflix.</p><p>But some goods things have come out of the show after watching the first six episodes.  After having some time to think about it, my opinion isn't as harsh as it initially was.  I'm still on record as saying it's dumb, though, so I have my bases covered...</p><div class='title'><b>Alternative Missions</b></div><p>In each Terminator movie the plot was exactly the same.  Skynet sends back an evil terminator back in time with the mission to (effectively) kill John Connor, the future leader of the resistance.  Future John Connor, sends back a force of good, whether it be a good terminator (Arnold) or a resistance fighter (Kyle Reese) in order to save John Connor's life from the terminator.</p><p>That's pretty much the plot of the pilot episode, but afterward they run into other terminator with missions that didn't involve killing John Connor what's so ever.  In fact, they weren't really even programmed to know what John Connor looked like.  So, Connor could walk right by one and it wouldn't ever matter.  Of course, if these Terminators realized that this is John Connor, they would kill him.</p><p>Anyways, for example, one such mission was to gather Caltec (?) Alloy which is the base material for creating the Terminator Endo-skeletons.  The mission was to gather this stuff, bring it to this specific location and await further instructions.  The Terminator completely this mission and stood by the door awaiting further instructions.  His wait instructions was something like this...<br/><pre>while(door not open && not interrupted) {    wait(15000); }</pre><br/>Honestly, no one would really be coming to this specific location until after the machine war broke out.  So the Terminator would be completely standing still there for 5 straight years.  That's computer logic for ya.</p><div class='title'><b>Time Travel Semantics</b></div><p>Traveling through time in the Terminator Universe will transport to a different time, but you'll be in the exact same position on earth.  I guess that makes sense.  That's also how it works in Back to the Future and other time traveling movies.  It doesn't work that way in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure though.</p><div class='title'><b>Survival Instincts</b></div><p>In the first episode, they "destroy" the evil Terminator and travel in the future 8 years.  But, what d'ya know, the Terminator actually survived, but has been beat to shit.  The Terminator lies in pieces around the scene at which he thought he killed Sarah and John Connor, but they really went into the future.  8 years later, they appear and the Terminator gets a second wind.</p><p>This Terminator, whom they've named Cromartie, has had its head blown off and flesh completely rotted away.  So he must find his head, but still blend in with humans.  He finds his head, but must create a new skin for himself.  So he finds some scientist and gives him the formula to create the skin.  So now he has skin, but he looks like the Toxic Avenger.  So, he finds a reconstructive surgeon to make him look like an actual person.</p><p>Rather than just going directly after John Connor, Cromartie is rebuilding himself and camouflages himself to accomplish his mission.  He realizes his limitations and must adapt.  I wonder if this is what the Terminators in the future realized after some time fighting the humans.  You can't win head on.  You need to deceive to conquer.  And even then it doesn't really work all that well.<br/>____</p><p>Anyways, I'm excited to see how the first season ends.  Though, I'll probably be dissappointed.  I keep forgetting that the whole Terminator mythos is one that puts Action first, and other things second.  Hopefully, they'll keep building up the mythos with these little tidbits rather than trying to make "awesome" action sequences.</p><p>We'll see though...  The second season has already begun!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Via Domus" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus">Lost Via Domus</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i><b>Lost Via Domus Spoliers</b></i></p><p>You'd think a television show such as Lost would be above whoring itself out to sell a couple of bucks but here are.  I'm pretty sure ABC owns the actual rights to the Lost name, or else this game probably would not have been made.  But after spending the afternoon with Lost Via Domus on Xbox, starting at Noon and finishing around 5:30pm, I'm glad it was made.</p><p>Lost Via Domus is a pretty decently put together fan fiction spanning 7 episodes taking place during Seasons 1 and 2 of Lost.  Each episode lasts about 30 to 45 minutes and centers on main character, Elliot Maslow.  Elliot finds himself on the island with no memory of the past and a mysterious man out to kill him.  Inklings of his past start to trickle back to him, when Lost characters confront him about his past.  Elliot must piece together his past in flashbacks while using this information in the present to progress further.</p><p>The writers of Lost Via Domus have a very good grasp of Lost lore.  Each Lost character confronts and deals with Elliot and his problems in a very stereotypical way for their character.  Jack doesn't believe you.  Sawyer doesn't care.  Hurley's your buddy.  Locke leads Elliot through the woods to find himself.  Michael yells Walt a couple times.</p><p>Each episode is meant to take place during the storyline of Lost, but in time breaks it and then breaks it completely wide open.  In the beginning, I was completely with Elliot fitting into Lost.  His character was out of the real story and in his own.  But eventually, Elliot starts to do things that he shouldn't be doing.  Like opening and closing blast doors from inside the hatch.  And using dynamite to blow open a secret area of the Swan hatch and neutralize the magnetic reactor.</p><p>The story does not fit into Lost, but the themes and style are pretty well put together and are very Lost.  The themes of your past eventually confront yourself on the island, and you have the choice to diverge from those themes and learn from the past, or doom yourself to repeat it.</p><p>Aside from that, the environment and graphics are absolutely beautiful though.  If you've ever wanted to walk around on the set of Lost, all you need to do is pick up this game.  You walk around the beach, the Swan hatch, the Hydra station, the Flame station.  You can even find the mediical "Staff" station and "Pearl" station to walk around to, if you can find them.  Each setting is absolutely perfect in the game, and taking pictures of various Lost props gets you achievement points.</p><p>Overall, I think Lost Via Domus is a very unique gaming anomaly.  It's an interactive fan-fiction totally made by and for Lost fans.  As a Lost fan, I can respect this product and think it succeeds at its goals.  As a gamer, the game isn't really all that bad.  It's well put together, but very simple.  If this game had a story completely of its own, I would probably like it on its own and look forward to what the team was doing next.</p><p>But, even after all these kind words, I would recommend it as a <b>rental only for Lost fans</b>.  Once you finish it, that's it.  It's just 7 episodes of fan-fiction...  nothing more.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Choke" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/choke">Choke</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year has been fantastic for movies.  Cloverfield.  Speed Racer.  Dark Knight.  I just got back from my second viewing of Pineapple Express.  Fantastic!  Summer is winding down, though.  The air has become chill.  And all the kids are back in town for college.  The year is not quite over, but there's still one movie left that I eagerly anticipate.  That's <b>Choke</b>.</p><p>9 years ago, <b>Fight Club</b> introduced me to the satirical dark writing of Chuck Palahniuk.  Throughout those 9 years, I've read all his novels, watched Fight Club a billion times, and even seen him in person.  Fight Club made me an instant fan.  It brought my from cinema into novels and even fosters some creative writing from time to time.  I'd probably be playing video games on the bus if not for Fight Club, really.</p><p>Anywho, 9 years later, another of Chuck's books has finally made it to theaters.  Choke opens September 26th in select theaters, but some people have already seen it at various film festivals.  And from what it looks like, there are some haters out there.  The negative reviews seem to have a similar tone... 'It ain't Fight Club'.  Well, it's funny you should mention that...</p><p>Fight Club has a very distinct tone throughout the movie.  It's a very dark dank vision of society and the people around you.  Putting on a polite show for humanity, despite feeling completely empty and emotionless.  Then starting to break out of your shell just a little with growing confidence in yourself as a person.  This distinct thought process is beautifully translated from the book into film.  When I read the novel, I feel like I'm inside the main character's head.  The same way you are in most of the film.</p><p>After I read Fight Club, I went right on to the next book.  I read Survivor, Choke, Lullaby, Invisible Monsters, and Diary.  Each one carried this same tone.  Each novel placed you deep into the main character's thought process, feelings and emotions.  As I read each novel, I felt completely in tune with the main character.  Choke felt very much like Fight Club.  Only a different setting, different character background, different vices.</p><p>3 months ago, I saw Chuck Palahniuk in Minneapolis for the release of his recent novel, Snuff.  During the event, they played the trailer for Choke.  I was excited.  Even more excited than I had been from just being at the event to begin with.</p><p>However, after viewing the trailer, I felt very conflicted.  It was absolutely nothing like how I pictured it in my mind.  As you can see for yourself, the tone is completely comical.  poppy.  funny on the outside.  Complete opposite emotions I felt when reading the book.  Not Like Fight Club.</p><p>So, I watched the trailer and the red band trailer a bunch of times and went back to read the book.  I read the book from the mindset of a comedy movie.  Maybe I just read it wrong?  Perhaps Fight Club was pushing my expectations into the deep dark mood because the movie effected me in such a way.  Maybe this is a strictly comedic book.</p><p>Naw.  The timing is totally off in the book.  The focus is clearly the emotions and thinking of the main character, Victor Mancini.  The little one liner jokes in the trailer are completely moved around to make it a comedy.</p><p>But!  Then again, these are fricken trailers.  Trailers are created by production staff to promote the movie to as wide an audience as possible.  Thinking back to 9 years ago, I thought Fight Club was garbage from the TV spots I saw.  I only saw it later on DVD when my friends made me watch it.  The overall feeling of the book or movie can't be easily illustrated in a 3 minute clip.</p><p>I'm still totally stoked for Choke, though.  I think I'm going into the film with a unique perspective that I have never  had with any movie I've seen before.  I think this'll be the first movie where I've read the book way in advance from the film being announced.  It's exciting to see the movie adaptation clash with my imagination.  For some reason I imagined the characters a lot skinnier...  Especially Paige Marshall.</p><p>4 more weeks!</p><p>Check out both trailers on the <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/" title="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/">Official Site</a>.  The can be a little tricky to find though.  Go to the restricted area, then go to videos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Scanner Darkly" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/scanner-darkly">Scanner Darkly</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today is Sunday, but it's not a normal Sunday.</p><p>I'm on a couch.  No, not my own couch.  I don't even own a couch.  It's a friend's couch and I'm stayed at his apartment last night.  He and I aren't the only ones here either.  Many friends of ours came to visit him.  We went to the massive drinking party known as Irish fest.  As usual, I drank more than my share, but I had a great time.  Drinking and Dancing.  I remember pretty much all of it.  The only part that escapes me where my steps exiting the gates and arriving to the couch.</p><p>But, it's now Sunday.  A very hazy Sunday.</p><p>Waking up is always a chore when your body feels wrecked.  All of us in the room, feel the same, so I'm in equal company.  It puts me in a good mood.  A grand time experienced by us all.  Time is short, though.  My bus back to Madison is in a few hours.  And my ride to the bus time is even sooner.  I shower and pack and off we go.  My friend has a very busy day so he drops me off with a good hour before the bus arrives.  Luckily, there's a Perkins nearby.</p><p>Sunday is a very popular day.  It's the most popular day for Perkins.</p><p>With half an hour before noon, the Perkins is filled with after-Church goers.  Many seniors with their best set of clothes on their old bodies.  Many children in their best Sunday dress or slacks.  Families, both old and young.  And me.  Standing in the entrance-way holding a backpack full of worn clothes and shampoo.  Holding another bag with my computer and other personal belongings.  Alone.  With slightly damp untied hair down past my shoulders.</p><p>Table for one, please...   Jim.</p><p>To the inquisitive population my mouth moves and spews out those words.  My eyes wander to the table of grandmas nearest to me.  Then they dart back across the restaurant to the front counter to catch a name tag.  Kim.  Slowing moving across the assortment of pies and muffins under glass.  I am a bit hungry, but that's way too much sugar for the morning.  That muffin is larger than my fist.</p><p>Should be about a 15 minute wait.</p><p>I figured that would be obvious from the crowds of lightly colored dressed people.  I find a bench and set my things down.  There are three other groups of people waiting beside me in this green and black carpeted foyer area.  Two of these groups are a single couple.  Both young men taking their girlfriends or wives to an early afternoon meal.  The other group could be either couple in 10 or 15 years.  A middle aged father in jeans with a ratty shirt with a Beer logo on it.  A wife with a big blonde pony-tail, jeans and jean-jacket combo holding a generic baby carrier with two screaming children using their mom as an obstacle for whatever game they're playing.  I smile, but inside I can't stop laughing.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>15 minutes later, the half-dead elderly couple had thoroughly scrapped themselves out of a booth for me.  I feign sincerity as they pass by.  I lift up my belongings and follow Kim to a now lonely booth by the window.  Such a waste.  Isn't there a smaller table for just one person?  Am I really expected to fill this 4 person space?  I complain to myself, but say only thanks.  My bags take up all the room next to me.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Quickly, A young short woman greets me.  She's incredibly perky for a Sunday morning.  Morning to me, anyways.  Hi, I reply.  She asks me if I want anything to drink.  Milk, I reply.  She asks me what size.  Large, I reply.  And what would you like to order today, She asks with a smile.  What's with all these questions.  So fast.  I hardly had anytime to look at the menu, let alone think a response.  Can I get a water too, I reply.  Sure thing, do you want a minute or two to look at the menu, She asks with a smile.  Yep, I reply.  And off she goes bouncing around with her blond pony tail swaying from side to side.</p><p>What <i>was</i> up with all those questions?  Do single patrons always know automatically what they wish to order?  Oh geez, I wonder what I was suppose to say...  Well, at least I can figure out what to order before she comes back.  I want an omelet of sorts.  Nothing else really looks as fine to me at this hour.  That's what I'll say when she returns.  And I'll practice it in my head a couple times so it doesn't sound weird.  Ugh, that's weird in of itself.</p><p>I bet that grandma over there think I'm weird.  Why is that gentlemen alone, she must wonder.  She probably asks herself a lot of useless questions like that.</p><p>The cheery waitress returns with my drinks and asks the question I've already answered in my head a couple times now.  I want an omelet of sorts.  What kind of sorts, she inquires.  One with tomatoes, mushrooms, veggies, and these two cheeses.  Splendid, she says with a smile.  You also get a muffin and some breakfast potatoes.  Splendid indeed.  And off she goes to put her scribblings up in the kitchen for the minimum wage chef.</p><p>I don't normally talk that way.  In fact, can I even be sure that really just happened?  Now I don't have anything to stare at with the menu gone.  Perhaps now is the best time to finally that book I've been reading.</p><p>Scanner Darkly</p><p>I've seen the movie before.  I've owned the movie for a while now.  And have watched it several times.  But the book is incredible.  Bob Arctor is truly beside himself in ways that the movie simply did not convey.  He is paranoid and a drug addict.  He feels he's doing the right thing by working for the police and spying on his friends.  His dark dank life is injected with a little good through himself.  But Bob Arctor is also Fred.  The undercover law enforcement officer spying on Bob Arctor and his friends.  What despicable lives they have.</p><p>Bob Arctor continuously takes Substance D as a stress reliver, recreational activity, and... well, just because it's there really.  He's addicted.  And the overuse of Substance D causes his brain to split.  The two hemispheres reveal conflicting information.  One side is Bob Arctor, the depressed drug addicted loser.  The other is Fred, the crappy undercover cop who's really wasting the government's time.</p><p>Reading the book reveals the full picture of Bob Arctor and his friends.  The movie is really just excerptse from the book.  Carefully chosen and edited scenes picture perfect from the text to paint a cohesive story that leaves several details out.  Details that didn't really matter to the story, but gave more insight to Bob Arctor and his growing paranoia.</p><p>I like this book a lot.  The whole 60s/70s lingo is fun too.</p><p>This is the first book written by Philip K Dick I've read, and I plan to continue read more.  But I get the feeling they won't live up to this one.  I'm not really a big fan of Sci Fi novels.  I think Sci Fi novels focus too much on the science fiction of the environment rather than the characters...  and so forth.  I love reading about the characters and what they're thinking during events.</p><p>Here ya go, sweetie.</p><p>Excellent.  Eggs, Veggies and little breakfast potatoes.  I consume them while getting closer to the ending.  The perfect meal for this Sunday.  I get my muffin to go and say Goodbye to the lovely waitress with a handsome tip.  The sun is slightly higher in the sky and I have 30 minutes before the bus arrives.  Through the window, I see the waitress bouncing around from one table to the next.  Across the street, I see my destination.  The bus stop.</p><p>Over the road and across the parking lot to the Goerke's Corner I go.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent

| July 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b><em>SPOILERS</em></b></div><p>As I'm sure everyone else has said, Heath Ledger as Joker is brilliant.  Not the casting call, but Ledger's acting job,  it's Fricken incredible.</p><p>I found it really interesting that Nolan intentionally neglected to provide an back story for The Joker.  I'm sure it was the exact same case for the criminals of Gotham when Batman appeared.  One day, he just showed up and completely ruined everything for them.  One day, this day, Joker just showed up and changed the equation again.</p><p>He's not just some super villain for Batman to fight in another Batman movie..  he's a true nemesis.  He exists because Batman exists.  There's no other reason to Joker's plot or ambition.  It's just to put wrong with what is right.  To play around with society and knock it off it's tracks.</p><p>Everything else in the movie was muted compared to Joker.  Everyone else took backstage and I really didn't care about them because Joker cast such dark shadow of their acting abilities.  Why the hell does Bale talk like he's coughing as Batman anyways?  Dent completely changed character so fast after becoming Two-Face..  yeah yeah, he's two-faced, but he went to killing cops kinda fast.  Gary Oldman was fantastic as Gordon, but his character whispers all the time and doesn't stand out.</p><p>It's a truly sad affair that Heath Ledger killed himself earlier in the year with a drug overdose.  All that potential and brilliance is completely gone now, but I guess it doesn't matter.  It puts his performance completely stand-alone in the series.  Between both movies, this feels like the climax of the entire new Batman movie series.  What other super-villian could come along and mean more to the series as Joker?  Mr. Freeze?  Poison Ivy?</p><p>I think Nolan has outdone himself, and even though they are working on the next Batman movie already, how can it really compare?  This first movie looks silly compared to this thanks to the Joker.</p><p>Joker, Joker, Joker..  that's all Dark Knight really is to me.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's all melting around me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me">It's all melting around me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 15, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the mail today, Netflix graciously delivered <b>House of Wax</b>.  That 2006 piece of shit horror movie with Paris Hilton and a supporting actress.  I'm not really sure how it snuck itself all the way to first place in my queue, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through the entire thing.  To be fair, I did have the things on 1.5x Play to make sure I only wasted an hour, rather than an hour and a half.</p><p>My expectations were pretty simple..  I knew this film was garbage.  I expected garbage.  But House of Wax still managed to disappoint me and fail my expectations.</p><p>Though it did not fail my expectations as badly as Nintendo and Sony had today.  For this week is E3, the Electronics Entertainment Expo is Los Angeles.  The event that has set itself as a milestone in game development and allows companies to show what they have accomplished and what big things they have in store for gamers in the coming fall and Christmas season.</p><p>Yesterday, Microsoft had some great announcements such as a new 60 gb Xbox 360 coming out in a couple of weeks to replace the 20gb.  The harddrive expansion should help out a bit since another announcement was that you can install full Xbox 360 games onto your harddrive for far faster loading.  EVEN bigger news was that Microsoft has teamed with Netflix to stream "Watch Instantly" titles directly to your Xbox 360 if you have a Netflix subscription and an xbox live gold subscription.</p><p>They also showed off some of there games namely <b>Gears of War 2</b> (dumb) and <b>Fable 2</b> (sweet!) and ended their conference announcing that Final Fantasy XIII will be coming to the Xbox 360 in America.  This news literally broke some corners of the internet..  namely neogaf.  Squaresoft held a Q&A session afterward where everyone wanted to know the details.</p><p>The Xbox is looking quite lucrative..  Even before the conference, Fable 2 was really the only next-gen game that interested me this Fall and with the Netflix integration and new 60gb models, I'll be in line that mid-August morning to pick one up.  Hopefully there'll be some sort of sale..</p><p>That's fine for the Xbox though, but I'm MORE interested in the game consoles I own.  I've owned a Wii for well over a year now, and in the last 3 months I haven't even touched it.  There's nothing on the Wii I want to play right now, and nothing down the pipeline either.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same is with the Playstation 3.  I bought that thing about a month ago, loved Metal Gear Solid 4 to death, and now all I do with it is play DVDs and Blurays.  There's nothing on the Playstation 3 coming down the pipeline I want that I wouldn't have a better time with on the 360.  Any multi-platform titles that has a smidgen of Online functionality, I will choose the Xbox version because I have MORE friends with Xboxes and it's MUCH easier to join games with them.  <b>Ghostbusters</b> has Online co-op?  Xbox purchase.  <b>Resident Evil 5</b> has Online Co-op?  Most likely Xbox purchase.</p><p>SO, that made me quite excited for this morning when Nintendo and Sony had their E3 press conferences and I feverishly waited for a megaton announcement to rival the Final Fantasy XIII on Xbox announcement yesterday.  In fact, I popped up the live video to listen to while I worked rather than just looking at the news pouring in from sites.</p><p>The first conference of the day was Nintendo.  They showed off a snowboarding game with the Wii Balance Board, then<b> Animal Crossing</b>, then some DS games..  Then they showed off <b>Wii Sports Resort</b> (Wii Sports 2), which I thought was pretty damn important for them.  It'll definitely sell a ton of copies since everyone knows and loves Wii Sports.  I was somewhat excited for them, but for me..  who cares?  It's just another collection of Wii mini-games to go along with all the other top-selling games on the Wii.  Then they announced <b>Wii Music</b>, which was laughable.</p><p>And that was it...  Iwata mentioned that the Zelda and Mario teams are hard at work on new Wii titles, but gave absolutely no hint as to what those titles are, nor when we know of them.  All the games shown for Wii were more crappy mini-game compliations and Animal Crossing, which is an MMO chat room furniture collection game I've already played to death on the gamecube.  Frakking bullshit.</p><p>I shrugged it off though..  my Wii is kinda broken now anyways, and my monitor only accepts digital signals, so the Wii looks like crap on it.  I've been setting my sights on HiDef gaming more recently so bring on the good news Sony!</p><p>Nearly 2 hours later, the Sony conference began and I sat listening to Jack Trenton talk and talk and talk.  <b>Yakuza 2</b> (on PS2) got a little face time in the Playstation 2 trailer, which made me happy.  That's another game coming out this fall that I've been waiting for.  Trenton unveiled PSN movie rentals which was the biggest joke after Microsoft announced its Netflix partnership the day earlier.</p><p>He also announced that they have 130 titles coming to PS2 by the end of the year...  That's a lot more than they have for the Playstation 3.  Obviously the Playstation 2 has a huge attach rate, but it's time to move on.  Focus on the Playstation 3 because the Xbox hit 5 or 6 home runs just yesterday, not to mention all the blockbuster releases last year.  Metal Gear is all you have going for you and Microsoft has shown that it doesn't need it.</p><p>An hour into the conference and they finally get to showing off the upcoming games for Playstation 3.  Sony officially announces God of War 3 (boring), they show off some other game, and unveil MAG, a 256 player war simulator.  Another fucking war game...  and that's the show.</p><p>Once again, absolutely nothing that appeals to me at all..  No immersive single player experience that will have me loving video games the way Twilight Princess, Mario Galaxy and Metal Gear Solid 4 have.  Resident Evil 5 will probably fill that bill, but Sony didn't give any face time to it.  Microsoft showed off a demo and gave a March 13th, 2009 date AND announced online co-op.</p><p>The future is grim for my interest in these two consoles in the next year.  There's still whatever game the Zelda and Mario teams are working on for the Wii (<b>Kid Icarus</b>).  And there's <b>Yakuza Kenzan</b> and <b>Yakuza 3</b> for Playstation 3, but haven't been announced for an American release.</p><p>The Xbox has Fable 2 coming out in October, and huge multi-million-dollar-deal DLC for Grand Theft Auto 4.  Probably some Mass Effect DLC once Bioware finishes Dragon Age.  There's also Galaga Legions from the creators of Pacman CE.  AND Online Co-op for Ghostbusters with friends!</p><p>I really feel that once I actually get an Xbox, my other two consoles will just sit there, against the wall.. especially the Wii.  The Playstation 3 I'll use for Blu-ray and upscaling Playstation 2 games.</p><p>There's not a whole lot of redeeming qualities..  much like House of Wax.  For a horror movie, there's NO nudity.. what the crap?!  The acting goes from bad to worse to slap-in-the-face horrible.  However, in the end, the main characters set the House of Wax on fire and frantically escape as it turns into a boiling molten pit of fire and craziness.  Also, Paris Hilton dies.  House of Wax will always have that over the Nintendo and Sony conferences.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Protomen @ Frequency, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-protomen-frequency">The Protomen @ Frequency, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is in this society where the evil robots rule.  The evil robots that were given life by the evil Dr. Wiley.  The Darkness must be vanquished.  It must change..  and thus.  In the year, 200X, the free thinker Dr. Light created Protoman.

The fight was over quicker than lightning, and Protoman had fallen.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080712_protomen/IMG_1519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080712_protomen/IMG_1519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080712_protomen/IMG_1519.webp" /></p><p>I have killed your leader and I will vanquish evil, but Humanity must pay for their weakness for they have made me kill my brother.  You call me a hero for killing him, but he is the true hero.  He has fought and died for you.<br/>____</p><p>This is the saga of Protoman.  A metal/garage rock opera telling this epic tale of courage and loss.  Unfortunately their time at the Frequency was way too short and they did not tell the full tale.  They played select tracks from their opera, and a few others from their other works.  With time running short they busted out Danger Zone for everyone to rock out with.</p><p>I did not stay for Fermata nor Les Breastfeeders, which were the real acts of the evening.  I had got my money's worth for a short hour of Protomen, and I also bought their two CDs, so off I went to meet up with people at bars.</p><p>The Protomen were a lot of fun. ^_^.
