So, I was pretty great to finally be cured of Pink Eye by yesterday in order to attend the concert I had already purchased tickets for.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5889.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Nick Nice</b></div><p>I got there pretty early, and was able to catch Nick Nice's entire opening set.  Nick Nice has been around Madison for quite a while.  He's always opening for shows at the Majestic and the headlining 80s v. 90s nights at Majestic.  He seems to wear several different musical hats.</p><p>This was the first time I had actually heard anything he's done.  I was pleasantly surprised when he began his set with some very melodic ambient progressive tracks.  Those first two or three songs he played were amazing.  Once more and more people arrived and there filled the dance floor, he quickly transitioned out of the layers and into some god awful house music.</p><p>Ugh... Why would you do that?  You spent 20 or 30 minutes building up this wonderful sound, and then through it all away for this crap.  Not all House music is bad, but when it carries no melody, no progression, or anything interesting at all, there's absolutely no point.  It's background noise.  And then he throws in a hard electro track out of nowhere.</p><p>Overall his set made no cohesive sense at all.  He started off brilliantly, but it turned into a mish mash of song that had no business being with each other.</p><div class='title'><b>Future Rock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp"  /></p><p>Future Rock were pretty incredible though.  I actually hadn't heard of them or any of their music prior to going to this concert.  I looked them up on youtube for about 10 minutes, and then bought the tickets, but that's about it.</p><p>The band seems somewhat outdated.  The name, Future Rock, sounds like something you'd hear in the 70s or 80s.  Especially with the heavy use of Keyboards.  The band members themselves look like they're in their 40s.  I wonder if they made this band in the 80s..  Or if they made it as a retro throw-back to those ideals.</p><p>They definitely sound like they're from that era.  The keyboards scream "Future" in terms of the past, like an old Science Fiction movie or Tangerine Dream album.  It's really neat. ^_^</p><p>Here's their opening song...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YhhRpY1ENXo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YhhRpY1ENXo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I decided to leave somewhat early.  I listened to them for over an hour.  Around a midnight they finished a set, and said, "Oh Madison, we're just getting started!"  If I hadn't been sick all week, and actually had been sleeping enough, I totally would've stayed until 1am or 2am.  But, I did the responsible thing and got home to sleep enough for work the next day.  Yeah yeah...</p><p>But it was fun.  The Majestic was completely full with young college kids too.  Much like MSTRKRFT @ The Rave this past weekend, I'm glad to see the youth of today getting into electronica. ^_^  It paves the way for a bright future.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5913.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5937.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MSTRKRFT @ The Rave, Milwaukee" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mstrkrft-the-rave-milwaukee">MSTRKRFT @ The Rave, Milwaukee</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last Night, Leif and I traveled to The Rave in Milwaukee for MSTRKRFT.  MSTRKRFT were pretty damn amazing, and La Doche Vita were pretty awesome, too.  But, The Rave is a fucking pit.  A dank disgusting disease ridden shithole that I will genuinely need to reconsider visiting.</p><div class='title'><b>Electro and Youth</b></div><p>It was pretty great seeing a vast amount of actual electronic music fans at this event.  The past couple times that I've been to The Rave definitely had fans of the music, but it really wasn't Milwaukee's scene.  Milwaukee has greater roots in Metal and Punk, rather than a bunch of raver kids.  Minneapolis and Chicago are the real hubs around here for that kind of music.  Maybe that scene traveled from somewhere else into Milwaukee tonight for MSTRKRFT?</p><p>Though, additionally, MSTRKRFT and Electro House music generally garners a different crowd than the music that introduced me into Electronica.  The Electro House genre is pretty new and is still exploding with new talent every year.  With its arrival brings a new generation of kids into the electronic music sub-genre and sparks it with the energy of youth.  The general age of the crowd was kinda young.  Much younger than the crowd for <a href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee" title="/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee" title="/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method</a> a couple months ago.</p><p>That endless amount of youthful energy feeds from the powerful charge of Electro.</p><div class='title'><b>MSTRKRFT</b></div><p>These guys continue to push and develop the genre how they see fit.  MSTRKRFT are the ones basically writing the definition of Electro House.  It's amazing how most other Electro DJs follow in their footsteps, but are still one or two steps behind.  MSTRKRFT keep a distinct sound for themselves that completely sets them apart from the rest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp"  /></p><p>I was confused about when they were going to perform.  When we arrived, it looked like JFK (Jesse F. Keeler of MSTRKRFT) was already up on stage with another dude..  Once they finished, and after La Doche Vita performed, fucking DJ Funk took the stage and completely ruined the vibe.  Is DJ Funk a legitimate DJ?  or a mock DJ?  I couldn't tell if it was a joke..  Leif and I left the room and went to the other area with some locals spinnin' songs.  After a little while, we checked the main room again, and they were on stage, huzzah.</p><p>It was pretty incredible.  I'm not very current on Electro at all, but when it's on, it's on.  They played some amazing songs including one of my favorites, "D.A.N.C.E" by Justice, which I captured some on video..</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>La Doche Vita</b></div><p>Right before DJ Funk nearly ruined the evening, La Doche Vita performed a pretty great set themselves.  They mentioned they're originally from Milwaukee, but got their start down in Chicago.  They are a very young duo having only formed in 2008, but since then, have made some incredible remixes of The Faint, The Prodigy, Femme Fatality..  They have a couple of these remixes available on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita" title="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita" title="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita">MySpace page</a>.</p><p>Their set consisted heavily of these types of remixes.  Leif was able to pick out Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, The Prodigy..  One of my favorite songs of the night was a remix of The Prodigy's "Smack my Bitch up" set against Deadmau5's "Ghosts 'n Stuff".  I got some video of that, too...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8XDdili0iPc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8XDdili0iPc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I'm pretty sure they were dead-set on playing that song when they noticed one of the dudes in the crowd wearing the Deadmau5 mask.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Rave</b></div><p>For the past couple of years now, living in Madison and visiting Minneapolis and Chicago regularly, it's been incredibly pleasant thanks to the Smoking Ban.  Cigarette smoke had never bothered me to the point of rioting, but it's subtle benefits are great.  My clothes aren't disgusting the next day and the air inside those bars and clubs are quite clean and occasionally refreshing.</p><p>The Smoking Ban has been yet to extend itself to Milwaukee, or at least this part of Milwaukee.  It's never been a problem for me before.  But my throat has been screwed up from food poisoning earlier this week and hadn't fully healed, yet.  Obviously yelling really loud wasn't a good idea, but with everyone smoking as if they needed it to live,  the polluted air was extra damaging.  My voice is pretty screwed up today.</p><p>Also, on the way home, I started feeling some pain in my left eye.  It was really annoying, and made me tear profusely.  It wasn't particular painful.  It just felt like something was stuck in my eye.  When I got home, my eye was a little puffy.  That's happened before..  nothing new there.  I just went to bed.  This morning my eye was inflamed.  It had fuse shut with all the gunk it excreted throughout the night.  It looked pretty gross.  A quick search of the symptoms and yep, I have pink eye.</p><p>How the hell do you get Pink Eye from going to a concert?  Especially when I hadn't touched a single thing inside the place at all.  Some website mentioned "sensitivity to light" being a cause.  Could a constant bright strobe light pointed at my face cause my eye to burst out in Pink Eye?  I've been going to clubs and concerts for years with like setups, and this has never happened.</p><p>Fucking diseased, smoke ridden venue...  Never again!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo @ House of Blues, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-hernan-cattaneo-house-of-blues-chicago">Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo @ House of Blues, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>October 2009 has been absolutely amazing.  The amount of talented musicians I've seen this month dwarf the entire year.  Seeing Moby Live for the first time was amazing, and John Digweed was incredibly powerful.  Dark Dark Dark came to town, and so did MC Chris along with his openers.  Each performance made me more and more excited for what was to end the month.  Sasha was returning to the midwest, and the day had finally arrived.</p><div class='title'><b>House of Blues</b></div><p>This was my first time to the House of Blues.  I've been to several clubs and venues in Chicago, but always manage to avoid the House of Blues somehow.  The House of Blues is somewhat close to Visions and Soundbar.  But unlike those clubs, House of Blues is more a venue.  It has an actual prominent stage that can be seen from almost anywhere in the place.  It's very easy to move around and talk with people too.</p><p>Being a venue, the people who attended the show were actual music fans.  It's quite a difference than the normal douchebag crowd you'd find at Visions.  It was rather refreshing.  Dave and I talked with a dude in the line about music while we waited.  And I talked with a few people inside too.  I'll certainly see some music nerds at Visions, but they are not as prominent as the rest of the club scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp"  /></p><p>Dave and I arrived at the House of Blues around 11pm and completely missed Chris Walsh and Wahi opening for Hernan Cattaneo.  This was my first time seeing him live.  And really, it was first time even listening to his music too.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_j_lEcpFlG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_j_lEcpFlG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>His sound was incredibly hard and deep.  It also echoed Electro to a degree.. but overall, very Tribal.  It was pretty damn amazing.  Though, I found it curious that he played at least 2 songs that Wahi played 3 weeks ago when Digweed was in town.  Hernan's tracks followed a somewhat predictable pattern, but that's not necessary a bad thing.  It made them more accessible and very easy to move to.  I definitely need to listen to this man some more. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp"  /></p><p>The tone of the atmosphere changed pretty quickly once Sasha got a hold of the decks.  The predictability went out the window.  And the sound became incredibly layered and ambient.  His selections were very organic.  The type of sound that fuses and shakes your body.  Like the rhythm of a heartbeat or the slapping of wooden instruments.</p><p>It was pretty amazing, too.  For a few years, I felt like I was drifting away from Sasha.  I felt like his sets were pretty solid and technically astounding, but lacked the variety that really made me a huge fan to begin with.  His set on this night felt like he was definitely returning to what made him an excellent DJ in the first place.</p><p>Mixing sounds that put him in a genre of his own, rather than simply Prog House.  It was all about layers.  Sounds building on other sounds.  Slowly building and slowly tearing down and slowly transitioning.  Like swimming in an ocean and letting the waves carry you to where ever...</p><p>Brilliant</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5rTbCHMOgsM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5rTbCHMOgsM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Wahi</b></div><p>It kinda sucks that we arrived too late to hear Wahi spin some songs, but hopefully he recorded what he did, so I can hear it later.

Thankfully, there wasn't a horrible ice storm of death, like last time.  It was actually really nice outside for a mid-October evening.</p><p>I'm not particularly a fan of Jonathon Coulton but I've actually seen him in concert a lot, which is somewhat weird.  I've seen him 6 times in the past 2 years.  Though, 3 of those were out of convenience of him performing at PAX.</p><p>Every time he comes through Madison, I buy a ticket and I wonder why.  I don't really like his music style and the crowd is usually packed with people that are WAY too into his music.  But, I still buy a ticket and attend the show.  And every time I'm glad that I did because I actually do enjoy myself.  It's pretty fun, and the show feels pretty unique, even though it's the same thing.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul &amp; Storm</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp"  /></p><p>Paul &amp; Storm have traditionally performed that exact same material every time I've seen them open for Coulton.  They start with Opening Band.  They sing the Nun song, the music tributes (the musician in this situation), the 15 second commercials, and end with Pirates.</p><p>Tonight, they actually performed new material and they didn't rely on the same formula of their past performances.  Here's their set list, which is a little out of order, and probably missing a song or two.</p><p>Paul and Storm - Theme Song<br/>The Way-Too-Early Christmas Song<br/>Frogger! The Frogger Musical<br/>Nun Fight<br/>Live<br/>Nugget Man<br/>If James Taylor were on Fire<br/>If Aaron Neville Were Waiting for a Parking Spot at the Mall, but Someone else Snagged it<br/>If They Might Be Giants were the Ice Cream Man<br/>Opening Band<br/>The Captain's Wife's Lament</p><p>Their Frogger song was pretty funny.  Starting off with new material gave their set of a fresh view for people that have seen them a couple times already.  When they sang their old stuff towards the end, it felt they were returning to the classics, rather than the same shit they sing every time.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp"  /></p><p>Like usual, the crowd couldn't stop yelling out random nonsense.  There was this girl behind us that couldn't help but yell in our ears as loud as she could.  There was some dude in the balcony that had a gasping, yelping laugh that was infectious at first, but annoying as shit after it continued for almost a minute straight.</p><p>Though, Paul &amp; Storm really feed off this crazy crowd.  They'll continue to respond to the random yelling and usually retort and continue the tangential cycle that keeps them from singing anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathon Coulton</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp"  /></p><p>Not too long after Paul &amp; Storm finished their set, Jonathon Coulton took the stage and immediately began his set, which is as follows...</p><p>1. ????<br/>2. Ikea<br/>3. Shop Vac<br/>4. Code Monkey<br/>5. I'm your Moon<br/>6. Curl<br/>7. Space Doggity<br/>8. "Dead" -They Might Be Giants<br/>9, Big Bad World One<br/>10. Creepy Doll<br/>11. Mr. Fancy Pants<br/>12. Drinking with You<br/>13. The Future Soon<br/>14. Skullcrusher Mountain<br/>15. Still Alive<br/>16. Mandelbrot Set<br/>17. You Ruined Everything<br/>18. Your Brains</p><p>1. A Talk with George<br/>2. First of May</p><p>Coulton certainly acts more mature than Paul &amp; Storm, so it felt rather awkward when the crowd would yell out random crap.  I guess Coulton didn't really care, but most of the nonsense he just ignored or attempted to cull.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp"  /></p><p>As I mentioned a few times, I'm not that big a fan of Coulton.  I've seen him 6 times live, but I've never actually listened to any of his music outside of a concert.  I've only heard the acoustic versions of anything he's done, except for Still Alive.  And every time he performs a song I've heard before, it's mostly identical to what I've heard before.</p><p>When I saw Moby perform earlier this year, his set was full of songs from his entire body of work, but each one was played in a new style, or brought something new to the table.  The concert was completely unique as it wasn't just a Live version of the song, but it was the 2009 Live version of the song.  Adding Paul &amp; Storm as background singers and percussion was a great addition, but maybe Coulton should bring something else or something more to his concerts to diversify.</p><p>It's great if you've never heard him before, but his past 3 performances in Madison are nearly identical.  I guess if you're a huge fan, you probably just want to hear the "classics" rather than some experimental evolution of his "classics".  I feel his songs have gone beyond the initial chuckle from the lyrics, and after that all you have is the underlying music, which I think is pretty standard.</p><p>He needs more experimental songs like Mr. Fancy Pants..</p><div class='title'><b>Coulton USB thingy</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp"  /></p><p>I mentioned that I've never bought or listened to any of Coulton's music before.  Well... that changed last night, as I purchased this Jonathon Coulton USB stick.  It's 2 gigs and contains ALL of his music, as well as, album art and source material for all the tracks of JoCo Looks Back (which is a CD of all his popular songs).  It was $50, which might seem like a lot, but, again, has all 9 or 10 CDs of his plus stuff he's posted on his blog.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/john-digweed-visions-chicago">John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The set lists that he builds are incredibly progressive and technically brilliant.  Tracks are meticulously chosen to build the progression of the set into a massive wall of bass.  Every time I've seen Digweed live, I have been absolutely blown away and wonder why I don't follow him as much as other DJs.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp"  /></p><p>The last time, I saw Digweed was with Sasha for their Spring tour on <a href="/old/v7/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">April 16th, 2008</a>.  But, the last time I saw him solo was on <a href="/old/v7/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">March 10th, 2007</a>.  At the end of both of those nights, I couldn't believe how fast the time had gone by..  Unfortunately, his set at Visions last night didn't capture they way he had in the past.

This is the second time I've seen him live and it's a little bit different than the last time.</p><p>The first time I saw him live was at The High Noon Saloon in Madison on April 27, 2009.  And that was actually the first time I ever heard of his music, too.  I had only known him from Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Sealab 2021, and didn't realize that he had such a body of work outside of Adult Swim.</p><p>I find his music to be somewhat inconsistent.  It seems to bounce back and forth between actual Hip Hop and Nerdcore.  I'm sure that's fine for people who like Hip Hop, but I'm not a fan.  Nerdcore is hilarious because I can actually identify with the Lyrics, but once he starts rapping about fuckin' people up and ass-jammin', I start to tune him out.</p><p>In a nerdy town like Madison, his performance was loaded with hilarious references to movies, games, and food.  He definitely won me over that night in April.  With the CDs I purchased at the show, I listened to them over and over, and eventually got all his previous CDs online and became a fan. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp"  /></p><p>Last Night, his performance followed that same pattern.  Here's most of the set list that I can recall...</p><p>1. ???<br/>2. ???<br/>3. Pizza Butt<br/>4. Japanese Maid<br/>5. Neville<br/>6. ???<br/>7. ??? (Robot Dog?)<br/>8. ???<br/>9. Robotussin<br/>10. Wiid<br/>11. Hoodie Ninja<br/>12. Geek<br/>13. Nrrrd Girl<br/>14. MC Chris is Dead<br/>15. IG-88<br/>16. Fett's Vette</p><p>He also told his story about a previous show at The Annex, where someone walked in on him taking a shit, which is probably why he performed at The High Noon Saloon earlier this year.  He also complained about the Killer Croc fight in Batman Arkham Asylum, which isn't that hard.  Though, after the show I mentioned that he might want to try flipping around using the Grappling Hook, rather than walking on the wooden planks.</p><p>Around that time, he was kind enough to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp">sign my CDs</a> and be photographed with me.

The genre attaches itself to my generation rather easily because those sets of sounds were the soundtrack to our youth.  The genre boasts many technical artists who try to get the most out of the primitive sound set, and others who try to make nifty sounding songs.  There's a fair amount of nostalgia listening to Chiptunes, but it still within the realm of electronica.</p><p>That isn't true with I Fight Dragons, who sing about Poppy nonsense from inspirations such as Weezer.  I think their songs stand on their own without the Chiptunes at all.  I guess they were trying to figure out someway of combining their love for Weezer and their childhood?  "Just sprinkle a little Nintendo on the top and we'll be so nerdy!"  Though, I'm sure some of those dudes are pretty nerdy.</p><p>It's one thing to cover old NES songs like Minibosses and many others, or to bring instruments into Chiptunes like Anamaguchi, but bringing Chiptunes into another genre with no context, cheapens the quality of your music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp"  /></p><p>Anyways, I bought their CD before the show and have listened to it a few times.  On a positive note, they are pretty decent for a Pop group.  If you visit <a href="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch" title="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch" title="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch">IFightDragons.Com/GimmeFreeMusicBitch</a>, you can download some of their songs.  If you sign up for their mailing list, they'll send you a link for 7 more songs.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dark Dark Dark " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dark-dark-dark">Dark Dark Dark </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 6, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><div class='title'><b>Dosh &amp; Friends @ Cedar Culture Center, Minneapolis</b></div><p><em>Originally seen on December 27th, 2008</em></p><p>Last year, a few days after Christmas, my little sister and I went to a concert in Minneapolis that sounded kinda fun.  The concert was entitled Dosh &amp; Friends, with Dosh headlining, Dark Dark Dark opening for him, and DJ Odd Nosdam spinning some tunes in between sets.  I had never heard of any of these people before, but the event was gaining some acclaim on MNVibe, so I figured it would be a good idea to check out.</p><p>Well, It wasn't quite what I expected.  It was held in a large community center type room with a shit load of wooden folding chairs filling the entire space.  "Ok.. I guess it's a 'sit down' concert.." I thought.  Jess and I grabbed some seats up front since it was pretty empty.  As the room began to fill with more and more of Minneapolis' hippy youth, it was starting to dawn on me that the music we were going to hear tonight probably wasn't the type of electronic music that I frequent.</p><p>There were some pretty weird people hanging around and talking with each.  My little sister and I kept ourselves busy by pointing out some other these people to each other.  After 20 minutes rolled on by (we got there kinda early), the room will pretty full.  The lights dimmed.  And some of those people we noticed earlier took the stage.  It was Dark Dark Dark..  And the crowd went overly politely silent.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp"  /></p><p>They began singing some songs with the audience at complete attention.  After each tune, the audience cheered and applauded for about 15 to 20 seconds, and then DEAD silence.  I mean, absolute silence in the entire hall of 300 or 400 people.  Not a single word was spoken for another 10 seconds, and they began their next song.  After they finished their song, there was applause and cheer and SILENCE.  It was the weirdest, most awkward concert experience I've ever had.</p><p>But Dark Dark Dark plays some interesting music.  The accordion brings an incredible old Italian romantic feel to their songs.  The banjo keeps the songs from getting too serious, and adds a laid-back layer to the sound.  And they have some cellos to provide bass lines.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp"  /></p><p>Even though it's very different from the "normal" music I listen to, their songs were very passionate and conveyed a very unique sound.  It's romantic and lonely and desperate and very human.  It feels like so much of their lives are each of their songs.  After listening to their music, it's like I just had a long conversation with them about their lives and how they live.</p><p>After performing several songs, the atmosphere of The Cedar became a little less awkward.  Head band members Nona Marie Invie and Marshall LaCount began chatting a little bit between songs and provided some background context.  At first glance, I thought they were brother and sister, but my mind was blown when they first mentioned children.  I guess when people find their soul mate and embrace it, they begin slowly transforming into one person.</p><p>Their set lasted an hour and a half, I'd say..  After some setup Dosh, started his set, which was pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dark Dark Dark (opening for Why?) @ UW-Memorial Union, Madison</b></div><p><em>which happened today, October 6th 2009</em></p><p>A month ago, I noticed Dark Dark Dark were going to be in Madison.  Even though, the skies were dark, and winds were fierce, I braved the storms and went downtown to see 'em.  Upon entering UW-Memorial, the Rathskellar was full of Madison's hippy youth.  I immediately knew I was in the right spot.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp"  /></p><p>Once again, their performance started off awkward.  Not as awkward as absolute silence, but awkward for the opposite reason.  Too many fucking people talking.  There are 2 very big reasons for this.  #1) This concert was free.  #2) The Rathskellar sells Beer.  The inhabitants of Wisconsin are a bunch of loud obnoxious drunks, so when we get any amount of Beer in our systems, our self-consciousness and attention span goes right out the window.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of the on-stage conversation Dark Dark Dark was trying to have was different to hear because of the noise.  Nona asked the audience how many people were from Minneapolis and not a single person raised their hand.  She asked another question, which I couldn't quite make out, that also went unanswered.</p><p>Their music was still just as romantic and infectious as the first time I heard it.  They were only on stage for an hour, but throughout that hour the atmosphere had changed.  By the end, everyone was on their feet at the stage.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Snow Magic</b></div><p>Back in December, after hearing Dark Dark Dark, I felt compelled to purchase their album, and I did.  But, I hadn't ever been in the mood to actually listen to it.  After recanting all these feelings I've had listening to their music live, I haven't really listened to them on my own.  But, I still have the CD and plan on giving it a listen.</p><p>The Snow Magic is their only album out right now.  Though, at their show tonight, they had a Vinyl single that contains two remixes.  DJ Odd Nosdam remixes "Junk Bones", and Dosh remixes "All the Things".  It seems like all those guys are pretty tight. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Moby @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">Moby @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I saw one of my favorite musical artists live on stage for the first time.  I haven't been with Moby since his beginning but since he released his album Play, I've been hooked.  Moby has a very infectious ambient sound that can calm my mood, but has been born out of a riot of punk and trance that he always keeps at his side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp"  /></p><p>Last Thursday, his concert displayed the range of his body of work.  It was like a concert of his greatest hits.  After a few songs, I thought it was a good idea to jot down his set list...</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. ???<br/>3. Wait for Me (Wait for Me)<br/>4. ???  (probably Jam for the Ladies)<br/>5. Bodyrock (Play)<br/>6. Go<br/>7. Pale Horses (Wait for Me)<br/>8. Great Escape (18)<br/>9. South Side (Play)<br/>10. In My Heart (18)<br/>11. ??? (Piano, "summer"?)<br/>12. Why Does My heart Feel so bad? (Play)<br/>13. We are all made of Stars (18)<br/>14. Porcelain (Play)<br/>15. "Take a walk on the Wild Side"<br/>16. Walk with me (Wait for Me)<br/>17. Natural Blues (Play)<br/>18. Porn Song from 1972<br/>19. Raining Again (Hotel)</p><p>Encore<br/>1. In this World (18)<br/>2. ??? (If I fall, let me go?)<br/>3. Extreme Ways (18)<br/>4. Honey (Play) + ???  (Guitar Hero)<br/>5. Feeling so Real</p><p>There are very very few concerts or musical events that I've attending where I knew the words to almost all the songs, but that I loved every minute of his 2 1/2 hour set.  In most concerts, the group only focuses on their most recent material...  Other groups are caught up in all their greatest hits from when they were good.  Even though, he played only a few songs from his new album, Wait for Me, Moby proves that his new album is stands along side his greatest songs.</p><p>With each song he played, the original melody and chrous was in tact, but was performed with the flavor and creativity building since its initial release.  Even though he "ended" with Raining Again, it wasn't the same version of the song you'd hear on the record from 2005.  He started off with the Porno music, and used that aura as a different direction to present the song.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics</b></div><p>After listening to The Protomen last year on <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen" title="/the-protomen" title="/the-protomen">June 13th 2008</a>, I modify my opinion of Lyrics in Songs.  Even though, they skew or are sometimes inconsistent with the message of the music, they provide a very solid base for remixes and future adaptations, almost as strong as melody.  Well, lyrics are basically part of the melody.  The only difference is that Lyrics have a literal meaning in language, whereas melody is interpretive.</p><p>Both are essential for defining a song.

| June 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Back in April, I finally got the chance to see one of my favorite electronic bands Live in Concert.  I'm not sure why Ladytron were on tour, but they came through Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>Ladytron has 4 members and originated in Europe (somewhere) in 1999.  They are somewhat hard to place because of some of their lyrics are in English, while others are not.  I always thought it sounded like Russian, but it's not..  It's not German either..  Wikipedia indicates Bulgarian.</p><p>I started listening to them somewhat by chance.  They'd been recommended to me a couple times, but it wasn't until I came across their CD in Exclusive Company (now out of business) that I decided that today was the day!  (Actually, that was only 3 years ago..)  One by one, I picked up each of their CDs and began listening to them more and more.</p><p>In the beginning their songs are pretty girly.  Most of the lyrics were about boys or other emo topics.  One song seems directly inspired by lead singer Helen Marnie's brief career as a fashion model.  "They only want you when you're 17.  When you're 21, you're no fun."</p><p>By 2003, with their release of Softcore Jukebox, I think they grew out of the emo mentality and started branching out with their music.  They tooked some risks and made some fun songs. ^_^</p><p>After that, Witching Hour and Velocifero were a definite return to their iconic electronic pop sound.  They've had some fantastic songs, but I think they rely on that sound a little too much.  I'd love for them to do another release on the lines of Softcore Jukebox.</p><p>One of my friends commented, "It's good to see a band steer away from emo lyrics.  I think most bands tend to start off strong and then go emo."</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron Live</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp"  /></p><p>My copies of 604 (their first album) and Light &amp; Magic (their second album) were actually re-releases that contained Live versions of their most popular songs.  This is the part of the CD I generally skip over because the levels are all weird and you can't hear the flange of the synthesizer pulling together the bass.</p><p>Unfortunately, this "problem" wasn't with the recording...  When Ladytron took the stage, it sounded like their levels were way off.  It sounded very amateur grunge (or whatever) without the omnipresent bass.  After a couple songs, I totally got into the event, but I think that was because I damaged my ears enough that everything blended together.</p><p>They played all of their iconic songs..  Ghosts, Runaway, Sugar, Seventeen, Destroy Everything You Touch, The Way That I Found You..  It was fantastic to actually hear a band live and know all the songs for a change. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp"  /></p><p>Afterwards, they were downstairs in Smartbar spinning records, but I pulled the old man thing and complained about my legs killing me and how all the kids in the venue are stupid.  So we left.</p><p>But before that...</p><div class='title'><b>The Faint</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp"  /></p><p>The Faint were pretty rockin'.  Prior to this engagement, I'd not heard of them.  So I didn't really pay close attention to them when they got up on stage, but throughout their set they won me over.  Not enough to actually buy their music, but enough to enjoy their performance a whole lot.  Their synthesized sounds mixed perfectly with their instrumental sounds. ^_^</p><p>The combination of The Faint and Ladytron made this night fantastic.  It sucks that we wussed out on their DJ sets, though, but oh well.  I'll visit Smartbar one of these days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Dave, Dan and I caught them for their most recent visit to The Rave in Milwaukee.  They came through the Midwest this weekend on tour of their 4th artist album, Divided by Night.</p><p>It's rather interesting that an electronica group so synonymous and iconic with electronic music has only released 4 artist albums.  These guys are legends and have been heard all over the world.  Even if you're reading this and don't know who The Crystal Method are, chances are that you've heard their music before but didn't know it.</p><p>Their first album, Vegas, which was released back in 1997 has been sampled, optioned, and used all over entertainment.  I was actually quite delighted when they played "Busy Child" during their set this evening. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp"  /></p><p>The Crystal Method rocked!  I've seen them before WAY back in 2002 when they were touring for their first mix album, Community Service.  Unfortunately, I don't have pictures from that event since it was before I owned a camera!</p><p>That night was pretty fun, but they just played their CD basically.  The first 7 songs from their set were mixed almost identically to the first 7 songs of their album.  Event-wise, I think they were too used to playing songs rather than being a DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp"  /></p><p>This was the first time I've seen them perform their music Live and it is a world of difference.  It was an amazing night with a super-friendly crowd that totally got into the music.  Everyone in the audience had a real great time.</p><p>The atmosphere completely changed once The Crystal Method got up on stage.  The aura at the beginning of the night was rather stale and toe-tapping.  It was playful, but the DJ didn't really know how to pump up a crowd.  He'd start building up to something, but then immediately tear it down.  He'd use songs with off-beat bass.  And he ended his set with "Push it" by Salt-n-Pepa.  weird...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp"  /></p><p>Once he left and The Crystal Method took the stage, the audience exploded.  A smile came across everyone's face, and everyone started bouncing around.  Whooo!  It was marvelous. ^_^</p><p>I wonder if they get this sort of attention everywhere, or if it's really unique to The Rave.  At the end of the set, they said that this venue was their favorite amongst the world.  That they've never had a bad crowd in Milwaukee.  I don't know if they were just pandering to the crowd or if they were honest or embellishing, but I'd believe it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/events/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/events/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
