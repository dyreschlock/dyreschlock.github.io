| December 17, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It has been nearly 2 years since I've been to a club, and actually heard some electronic dance music live.  After moving to Japan, I've focused on working in my remote town in the mountains.  But, this past weekend, I just happened to be free, and noticed that <b>Hernan Cattaneo</b> just happened to be nearby.  Way too coincidental to ignore.  I made the drive <a href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter" title="/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">from Takayama to Nagoya</a>, and went to see him.</p><div class='title'><b>Location</b></div><p>Club Mago is pretty easy to find.  It's a few blocks down from the Saeki area of Nagoya.  It's located within some standard looking building, which is currently under construction.  The club itself is on the 2nd floor of the basement, and shares the space with another venue.</p><p>Outside, there are plenty of open lots for parking.  Several were full when I arrived, but past 10 o'clock, those lots began to empty out, and there was plenty of space.  I parked in the lot directly across the street from the club.  At the end of the night, parking was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Inside, Club Mago is pretty small.  Once you get into the basement, you walk down a somewhat narrow hall, turn the corner, and are directly at the entry counter.  You pay your, and go inside.  There are two rooms.  </p><div class='title'><b>Space</b></div><p>The first room is fully lit, has several tables, and plenty of seating.  This area would probably feel like a club, if it weren't lit like someone's basement.  Stuffed around a corner in the room is a DJ spinning some lounge-y tunes.  And next to him is a food bar.</p><p>The next room has the main area.  Immediately to right when entering is the bar.  There are some seats at the bar, and across the way on the left tables and more seats.  The bar is maybe 12 or 15 feet long.  Then the room opens up into the dance area.</p><p>I feel like calling this place a "club" is a bit incorrect.  It's definitely a venue.  Past the bar, it's standing room only, and it's very dimly lit.  The floor, walls, and ceiling are painted black, and there's maybe 8 lighting rigs setup on the ceiling to illuminate the place.  It's not really flashy like I would imagine a club in a city as large as Nagoya to be.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Though, I think the real difference is that this place really doesn't have any offerings for V.I.Ps, or big spenders.  The dance floor is wide open for everyone.  There are no expensive drinks.  Cover charge is the same for everyone.  Everyone is the same.  This is way more characteristic of a venue than a club.</p><p>Obviously, there's nothing wrong with this.  I was just expecting something flashy and ridiculous as Japan often tends to do, but this was way more down to earth and normal.  I need to go to a club in Tokyo or Osaka and see how this compares.</p><div class='title'><b>Opener and DJ Ogawa</b></div><p>Though, upon entering, I definitely felt at home.  The opener prior to DJ Ogawa was spinning some familiar tunes I had heard recently on the Internet radio, and mixing them together quite well.  The first song was something off one of the recently Jody Wisternoff Intesifieds.  He mixed that into some remix of Delirium - After All.  The crowd was very sparse at this point.  There were probably around 20 people.  It was only 11pm, though.</p><p>The space began to fill up, little by little, and by midnight, DJ Ogawa took over.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He cranked out some pretty bangin' tunes, which certainly fired up the crowd.  I mentioned on Facebook that there were all rather predictable, though.  Predictable build, predictable release.  It was fine.  Certainly something the crowd needed in order to be ready for Hernan.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p>Hernan took over the decks around 1am.  According to Facebook, he was billed for a 5 hour set.  I really wonder if he kept going all the way 'til 6am.  I can't say, since I could not keep myself awake that late. :(</p><p>As he took over, his first tracks sustained the vibe built by Ogawa.  It was still a bangin' beat that kept the more energetic members of the crowd on their toes, and moving around.  Other members of the crowd weren't quite awake yet.</p><p>The crowd was yet another indication that I was at a venue, and not a club.  No one was really dressed to impress.  Most dudes that entered where simply wearing their street clothes.  Some were still wearing their backpacks, and bags.  Most dudes entered the dance floor, danced and rocked out with themselves.  Almost all of the crowds were dudes, really.  Very few woman.  Those that were there, really just danced and rocked out with themselves, too.  The crowd was really wholly comprised of music nerds and baseheads.</p><p>There were certainly outliers, though.  Mainly the western foreigners in the audience.  They actually came in groups, and danced with themselves.  They were drinking, yelling, and moving around the most.  They actually dressed up expecting this place to be an actual club.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At first, it seemed like Hernan was fighting the crowd.  He would play a bangin' track, and some members of the crowd began rocking out to it.  After the track, Hernan would pull back a little bit, and layer his songs.  It felt like he was building an atmosphere, a vibe.  He was really getting into his tracks, and letting us all see inside himself.</p><p>But the crowd didn't care.  As Hernan trailed making music, and building something, the crowd got bored, and mostly stopped moving.  Hernan threw back into more energetic songs to bring the crowd back on his side.  But when he trailed off again, the crowd didn't budge.  The crowd kinda sucked because it was a beautiful gorgeous vibe.  Any crowd from Chicago would've been following him completely.</p><p>Eventually he gave up, and turned his vibe far more energetic to appease the crowd.  Once Hernan changed and found the correct atmosphere for the crowd, the crowd completely woke up, and kept moving from that point on.  The more still crowd members began leaving as time went by.  Which left the true fans (and the drunk fans).  Past 3am, the crowd was amazing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Almost past 3am, I was starting to lose my energy.  I went back on the dance floor and rocked out for a while, but once I was out, I was done for the night.  I think I finally left around 4am.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>It was a pretty great night.  Though, it didn't really transform me in the way I was thinking.  When I was in the club and rocking with the music, I was no longer in Japan.  I was back in my music, and my vibe.  It was like any other club experience I've had back in the states.  I was no longer foreign.</p><p>This is a bit arrogant to say, but everyone else felt foreign like they didn't understand Hernan's vibe, and it took them a little while to adapt and change.  (Even though, Hernan was the one really changing his "tune".)</p><p>It was good to feel normal again.  Though, I've been away from the states long enough now, my "previous" life in the states is no longer normal for me.  Normal is coming back to Takayama and teaching these kids.</p><p>When I left the club, the musical vibe stayed with me.  But, as soon as I entered a convenience store to buy some water, I was back in Japan, and the music faded.  I was once again the foreigner, and out of place.  It's weird having my previous and current lives cross over each other.</p><p>Anyway, I'll certainly return there in the future when another fantastic DJ visits.  Great set by Hernan.  Hopefully I can stay awake next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Richie Hawtin's CNTRL Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/richie-hawtins-cntrl-tour">Richie Hawtin's CNTRL Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| December 6, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, legendary DJ Richie Hawtin came to Madison on his CNTRL Tour, which comes with the title "Beyond EDM".  The Beyond EDM moniker is the driving force behind this tour, and has several meanings behind itself.</p><p>Initially my thoughts were that "Beyond EDM" meant an exposure to other genres outside of the massive popularity of Electro House, Dubstep, Pop House, some Trance, and everything you hear on the radio, in most clubs, and so forth.  Many of the new kids to the scene don't realize the rich history and beautiful sounds of true House, Techno, and other more minimal genres that built the scene back in the day.</p><p>But, aside from exposure, the "Beyond EDM" meant something else, and something more.  In the strictest sense, "Beyond EDM" means there's more than just the music.</p><p>"Beyond EDM" means connections.  The wonderful thing about nearly all of electronic dance music is the community that supports it.  For those who are fans, it's about connecting with other fans and artists, supporting them, and sharing music.  For those who are artists, it's about reaching your fans, growing your fanbase, connecting with other artists, and supporting them too.  Support and Collaboration.</p><p>The best (and most unique) thing about Richie Hawtin's CNTRL tour was the education and community focus.  Earlier in the evening, Hawtin held a round-table style discussion and lecture at each of his tour stops, completely free.  Hawtin had 3 or 4 other panelists, and they would discuss various topics such as "the business of EDM", "EDM: Now and Then", "The evolving artist", etc.</p><p>In Madison, Hawtin held his lecture at the Madison Media Institute in southeast Madison.  It almost immediately sold out.  Along with Richie Hawtin, Kevin Saunderson, Ean Golden, Gaise, and Kurt Eckes, from Drop Bass Network all sat in front of us all and talked about EDM for about 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp"  /></p><p>The whole format was mostly question and answer, but the questions were a little bit leading, and were really more like prompts that guided the information the panelists wanted to say.</p><p>And I wrote a bunch of notes...</p><div class='title'><b>Rave Act</b></div><p>The first main topic of the night was history.  With the explosion of EDM today, we need to look at the past to make sure the same mistakes won't happen again.  Electronic dance music was rather prevalent in the late 90s with the rave scene, but it died out.  What happened?</p><p>This question was directed at Kurt Eckes.  Eckes is one of the founders of the Drop Bass Network, a company responsible for some of the largest rave events across the midwest in the mid 90s to the 2000s.  So, what killed his events?</p><p>Kurt had a few answers, but his main answer was the Rave Act, and the negative publicity of raves in general.  The Rave Act basically slammed an event where any illegal substance was found with a massive fine.  Cops would have the authority to raid any event they believed had a substance, and run through everyone there until they found something, or were satisfied enough, and left.</p><p>This was a huge bummer for several reasons.  Kurt admitted that nearly all of the parties he put on were illegal.  They never checked for drugs, and they pretty much didn't care.  After the Rave Act was introduced, it was way too risky to continue the way they were.  Hiring a bunch of security guards was a bummer.  And if, on the off chance, a party attendee brought something, and the Cops raided the place, he'd be slammed by the law.</p><p>Aside from that, other companies that did throw legal parties were still getting busted.  The cops would shut down the music, have everyone on the ground, and comb the place for an hour.  That's not a fun night for anyone, whether or not they actually find something.</p><p>The Rave Act killed the fun, and made everything too damn risky.  And Kurt's personal interest in the business was beginning to wane, and it just felt like too much damn work to go through all the red tape.</p><div class='title'><b>Clubs</b></div><p>One solution to the problem was to move the scene into the clubs.  But this had its own problem.  The club scene is not the rave scene.  Aside from banning illegal substances, clubs had strict operating hours.  Most of the places in the midwest had to close at 3am.  Most raves went until dawn, or even past dawn, continued through the next day, and night.  Raves never stop, but clubs certainly do.</p><p>The Rave kids just weren't into the club scene, so they just didn't go.  And with raves dying out, they had nowhere to go, and basically quit the music scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Shorter Sets</b></div><p>Even the artists had to adapt to the time restrictions.  DJs could no longer spin a 5 or 6 hour set on their own, they only had a time slot of an hour or 2.  True DJs don't play song after song after song, they play a set.  Songs are chosen to build off of each other, and tell a story.  6 hours is plenty of time to tell a story and try out new things.  But now that time has shrunk.  You can't tell a 6 hour story in just one hour.  There's not enough time to build, and have variety.  And instead of having 30 minutes to build up, you only have about 3.</p><p>There's very little time to be creative and flesh out anything new, too.  Hawtin mentioned that he really needs a good 4 hour set to try out new things.</p><p>To tell all that you want to tell, you need to build the intensity much faster with the shorter sets.  The story is condensed, and faster.</p><div class='title'><b>Larger Shows</b></div><p>Richie Hawtin asked the question, "Was the scene blowing up because of Skrillex, or did Skrillex blow up so fast because of how fast the scene grew?"  Obviously both the scene and Skrillex benefitted from each other greatly, but which one really started it?</p><p>Deadmau5 and Skrillex have raised the bar with the amount of production put into their stage performance at their shows.  But with the larger scale shows, this is so many more things that can go wrong.  Everything must be choreographed, and perfect for the show to be a hit.  Failure can be easy, so these DJs don't take as many risks anymore.  They can't.  They have to stick to a schedule, and can't be as flexible.</p><p>In fast, Deadmau5, who never considered himself a DJ in the first, really doesn't consider his artist persona his main job anymore.  He says that his title is an "event driven marketer."</p><div class='title'><b>Music Sales Today</b></div><p>Another big difference between the scene today and yesterday is that Music does not sell the way it used to, which is really due to piracy.  The whole panel really didn't slam piracy at all while they were up there.  Exposure is exposure.  It's just another vehicle to get your music out there and heard.</p><p>Hawtin gave the comparison that the scene was about a tenth of the size back in the day, but they sold about 10 times more records.  Which is incredible to think of.  But!  They were selling actual records.  These days, you can buy a whole album for $2 on the internet (or just pirate it).  And there's a ridiculous amount of competition.</p><p>Piracy is real and the competition, and the artist needs to be aware of these things.  You cannot survive on record sales alone.  You have to go out and perform your music, and personally spread your unique sound.</p><p>Which means you have to think of the whole package when composing music.  You have to know exactly how you're going to play your track, and design the track itself to be heard live.  And, your music ends up being advertising for your live show, and your message.</p><p>That last part is definitely true for me.  These days, if I hear something I like, I seek out the artist, and if I really like what they're doing, I want to see them live.  The live experience is a completely different monster than hearing something on the computer, or the iphone.  It is the whole package.</p><div class='title'><b>Balancing performance and creation</b></div><p>Building music and advertise your music means that you'll be out on the road and in the clubs a lot.  Hawtin finds himself having to schedule time to actually create tracks...  which is difficult.  You can't schedule creativity.  You need to be prepared to act when inspiration strikes.</p><p>And that isn't all that hard these days.  A lot of the music people make is on their laptops, and the very laptops they bring around with them to perform.  Going from studio work to club performance is nearly seamless.  You can perform works in progress, and really craft your tracks on the fly.</p><div class='title'><b>Copy Cats</b></div><p>It's really easy to make music today.  It's great for the artists, but it has opened the door for a lot of imitation and unoriginality.</p><p>You can take someone else's idea and run with it if you like, but people aren't as stupid as you think.  Fans and other artists are very in tune with what they hear and what they like and can spot a fake almost immediately.  They see right through them.</p><p>If you have no substance, authenticity, or originality, then you won't get far.  You have to be you.  Be natural.  Be genuine.  And the distinctiveness will shine with time.</p><div class='title'><b>Technology</b></div><p>The next question asked if anyone on the panel found it difficult to be creative with the massive influx of technology in the scene.</p><p>Hawtin replied with, "Technology opened up music creatively for me."  (or something like that.  damn autocorrect.)</p><p>He posed the question to the audience, "Do you really really care if the DJ is using the sync function on stage?"  Most of the audience basically just said no.</p><p>He continued by stating that Beat Matching is really is more mechanical than creative.  The machines we use today are WAY more precise than a record and a turntable.  DJ no longer have to chase records, and constantly make sure everything is synced up.  Technology today is incredibly liberating.  It gives the DJ peace of mind.</p><p>As such, they're able to be more creative and complex.  Hawtin can blend more than just two tracks together, and build a more unique layered sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp"  /></p><p>He demonstrated what he meant by that.  He went over to his laptop, and ran some sounds with each other using Traktor.  He had one track supply the baseline, while he blended the melody of two other tracks on top of that, and a fourth track with some samples.  This kind of thing is just not feasible with turntables.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment</b></div><p>The next train of thought went to the environment.  While the music should stand on its own, you're kidding yourself if you don't think the environment doesn't enhance the music.  Whether it be the crowd, or visuals, or being animated on stand, the environment is part of the performance.  It's part of building that moment for the audience.  And for some people, it's the catalyst that launches them into music, and transports them to another place.</p><div class='title'><b>Be Proactive</b></div><p>The scene is build on the idea of DIY, Do It Yourself.  Don't wait for someone to discover you, get out there and do it yourself!  Connect with everyone around you, and build your vision.  Reach out!</p><p>As you build your sound, let people in.  Accept criticism.  Accept help.  And give help back.  Be transparent, share idea, and include those interested around you.  That's how this scene was originally built in the first place!</p><p>Celebrate our diverse opinions, and grow!</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>Experimentation with your inspiration is how you find yourself.</p><p>Saunderson mentioned that one of the first things he ever did was attempt to copy a sound, or copy a feeling.  He would hear something, and try to recreate it from scratch in the studio.  And out of building toward that sound, the feeling, he found his own sound.  It was what he heard, but now it was through his own voice.</p><p>While copying things outright is rather opaque, you need to start somewhere.  Chasing what you like will give you direction.  And through that journey, you will find yourself.  You just need to keep at it.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>There were a couple more topics, but those were all the notes that I wrote down.  Hawtin ended the lecture with a rather inspirational quote, <b>"Dig deeper and continue to explore.  This is an incredible time.  Don't be disillusioned because popstars are making EDM tunes."</b></p><p>These times are pretty exciting.  I've met more people in the last 2 years into this kind of music, that I have ever met before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Majestic</b></div><p>I met up with Bryan after the lecture, we had dinner, and then we went to The Majestic, where the panelists performed.  Ean Golden started off the evening with an eclectic selection of tracks that went back and forth a little too rapidly for me.</p><p>The night began for me when Gaiser took the stage, and performed live.  Beautiful, rich, heavy Techno.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Kevin Saunderson took the stage, and blended some beautiful House tracks together.  Followed up by Richie Hawtin.  Absolutely incredible night.</p><p>The whole package was something truly unique and special: an education and a mind blowing performance.</p><p>Also, I broke my goddamn camera :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shpongle the Masquerade @ The Majestic" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shpongle-the-masquerade-the-majestic">Shpongle the Masquerade @ The Majestic</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 11, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I just got back The Majestic and it was another fantastic time put on by Simon Posford, otherwise known as Shpongle.  This is the third time I've see him DJing some fantastic tracks from his back catalogue, and every time he always pulls out something amazing of his I hadn't heard before.</p><div class='title'><b>DJ sets</b></div><p>The first time I saw Simon performing a DJ set was almost exactly two years ago in Minneapolis.  He was at the Epic event center, formerly The Quest.  His 4th album, Ineffible Mysteries in Shpongleland, was just released and his set consisted mostly of those tracks, along with Shpongle's entire catalogue.  I finally heard some of my favorite songs live, and the "new" song I heard that night was "I am a Freak".  </p><p>"I am a Freak" is by Younger Brother which is Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan.  Younger Brother is also part of Simon's record label, Twisted.  And Benji Vaughan also performs as a solo artist, Prometheus, also on the Twisted record label.  That night, Simon also performed a couple songs from Hallucinogen in Dub.  Hallucinogen is Simon's psytrance persona, and Hallucinogen in Dub consists of psydub remixes by Ott, also on the Twisted label.</p><p>After that night, despite playing all of my favorite Shpongle tracks, I realized his DJ sets were more of a showcase for his label with an emphasis on Shpongle.  Which isn't a bad thing at all.  This gives him PLENTY of content to work with and build a unique performance every time.</p><p>Last year, Simon went on a full fledged US tour with his stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  He played a fantastic set of original songs, remixes, and plenty of other songs on the Twisted label.  That night he played another spiffy Younger Brother song I hadn't heard before: the Cicada remix of "All I Want".</p><p>And tonight, it was another unique Shpongle experience.  His set was full of remixed Shpongle tracks, and he only played a few original versions of the songs.  His encore was freakin' incredible.  He played some fantastic psytrance beats layered with an Irish tone.  It was amazing how well those two sounds complemented each other.  I was off the ground, and hopping around to that tune.  Fantastic!</p><p>Simon was in a group called Celtic Cross back in the day, so maybe he pulled a song from the single album they produced.  His encore felt live an overall medly of Shpongle tracks though, so maybe he just mixed or mashed something in at the end.</p><p>Also, the audience was restricted from any audio recordings during tonight's performance.  It could be that Simon was road testing some new material for his upcoming 5th Shpongle Album.  I definitely heard plenty of Shpongle-like tracks tonight that I hadn't heard before, and didn't sound like remixes either.  I'm definitely looking forward to that new album.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage Presence</b></div><p>Another unique thing about each Shpongle performance has been the stage presence.  In Minneapolis, Simon toured with the dance troup Archedream for Humankind, which performed unique dances tailored to each Shpongle track performed by Simon.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" /></p><p>Last year, the Sphongletron absolutely blew my mind.  It just looked like a dumb weird looking setup when we first walked into The Majestic, but the Shpongle head attached to the front came to life when it was fully illuminated.  The projected face on the stage setup moved, twisted, and contorted along with the music.  It was so bright and lifelike that it actually looked like it was moving on stage.  You can see this in some video I took <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg">here</a>.</p><p>The Sphongletron experience was definitely my favorite time seeing Shpongle. :D</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" /></p><p>Tonight, Simon was back with a new contraption known as The Masquerade, I guess.  It was much larger, and had much more canvas for the projector to paint onto, but it was nowhere near as amazing as the Shpongle head on the Sphongletron.  The Masquerade had only visuals moving about the white canvas, rather than the canvas actually moving and contorting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" /></p><p>It was still an amazing time, though.  All 3 of these performances were unique and amazing.</p><div class='title'><b>Shpongle in America</b></div><p>It's pretty great that he's roaming around the US quite a bit these days.  I first came across Shpongle just after he released Tales of the Inexpressible, his 2nd album, in 2001 and really wanted to see him live.  But he never toured.  At least, not in the US.  He'd do shows in Europe, and Australia, but never in the US.  And now he's been through the midwest each May for the past 2 years.</p><p>AND his DJ performances have improved quite a bit over the last 2 years.  In 2010, it just seemed like he was playing track after track without a whole lot of transition between them.  Last year, he's been stitching the tracks together much more fluidly.  And this year, it was all a choreographed set.  The underlying tone flowed throughout his entire performance, and each track got its spotlight.  He's improved quite a bit!</p><p>Definitely check Shpongle out if he comes to your town. :D<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid-2">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, Gabriel & Dresden visited Chicago and put on an amazing performance that spanned genres, and eras.  At one point in time, Gabriel & Dresden were my absolute favorite trance group.  Their mixes were beautiful, melodic, layered, and sounded like nothing else, but I don't think they liked being restricted to a single genre.</p><p>Last year, I wrote a post about all of this: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">June 23rd, 2011</a>.  As time went on, they adapted their style towards the change in EDM.  They always featured some of the best tracks, and presented them with their own sound.  Their sound was as reactionary, as it was trendsetting amongst some Trance DJs.  I had always viewed them as curators of EDM, with an added focus on Trance.</p><p>After a 3 year break, they reunited last year with a slightly different sound than what people were used to.  It had a harder edge.  There was mainstream Trance tracks, some popular "House" tracks, and Dubstep tracks filling in some gaps, which was mashed up for consistent flow.  Plenty of fans complained about the change in style, but these people fail to realize that this is exactly what they've always done.  They've never been straight up trance.  (except for, maybe, at the beginning)</p><div class='title'><b>Last Year</b></div><p>Last year, they stopped by Chicago on <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid" title="/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">July 9th</a>, and performed a set nearly identical to others that had been broadcasted, recorded, and hosted online.  It was exactly what I wanted, but it had no surprises.  At that time, I think they were trying to get the word out there.  They built up a fantastic cache of mash ups, and remixes, and were ready to use them effectively in a city near you.</p><p>Fair enough.  They ended up using all those track to form an mix album, which was released on Armada towards the end of summer last year.</p><p>Today...  It's been a year since they've gotten back together, and they haven't been nearly as self-promoting as they were after the reunion.  I definitely wanted to see them again, and see what has changed, what they've learned, and how they've adapted to the rapidly changing landscape of EDM.</p><div class='title'><b>Last Night!</b></div><p>And they have adapted.  Last night, Dave Dresden and Josh Gabriel spun for a little over 3 hours.  And started off with some somewhat heavy tracks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp"  /></p><p>I caught the first 40 minutes on video, which you can find here:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU</a></p><p>They started off with a mashup of Beautiful Things, and went into some heavy tracks.  45 minutes into the set, they started shifting focus a little bit, and started playing a lot of their tracks from last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp"  /></p><p>I definitely heard the following tracks:</p><p>- Andain - Promises (Gabriel & Dresden Remix)<br/>- Motorcycle - As The Rush Comes (DJ Kue Remix)<br/>- Clashback vs. Michael Woods vs. R.E.M. - Losing My Outset (Gabriel & Dresden Mashup)<br/>- Josh Gabriel pres.

They played the obligatory Sun & Moon track, but started going deep into their pockets to give us a full out fan service retrospective.

I've now seen them twice after their reunion, and the other times were in 2004 when I was WAY into them.  Oddly enough, the first time I saw them live was February 28th, 2004, almost 8 years ago exactly.  And I wrote about that experience as well.  Be prepared, as it is very horribly written --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/chi-town" title="/chi-town">Click!</a>.  I took a lot of <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago">pictures</a>, too.</p><p>I met some people from the Trance Addict forum in real life, and we had a meet and greet with Gabriel & Dresden at a bar down the road.  It was awkward, hilarious, and insightful.  As that post states, Josh Gabriel explained that he thinks of sounds in the form of textures, and used the feel of a song for his composing and mixing.</p><p>I think that rings true today, as their recent sets continue to flow just as well as the ones back in the day.  In fact, I think their sets from the last year are more cohesive than the ones they played leading into their break up.  Sure, plenty of the tracks are popular, but it's never a jolting experience when it's mixed in.  They've edited and mashed the songs to fit their style, so it's consistent with both the original track and their sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Final Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I'm glad to see these guys continue to dominant.  I was a little scared when they hadn't been promoting as much these days, but they are far from dormant.  I'm sure we just got a taste of their upcoming performance(s) at WMC next month, and I can't wait to see what they have down the road.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis-2">Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

As they took the stage, right before midnight on Saturday, their gigantic LED display started off by saying, "Minneapolis, it's been too long."</p><p>Currently, on tour for their new artist album, <b>Group Therapy</b>, Above &amp; Beyond have visited a lot of lesser known clubs.  I think they intend to have another North American tour later in the year to all the American clubbing hot spots.  They've completely skipped over New York and Florida.  And have found themselves in Indiana, Ann Arbor, St. Louis, and plenty of Canadian areas too.</p><p>I was there in November 2009 when they took the stage and completely reopened my dormant thoughts about the good 'ol days of Trance.  All of their tracks were beautiful, melodic, and completely uplifting.  I was smiling all night.  <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Read all about it!</a></p><p>Last night was a little different though :/</p><p>A lot has changed in Electronic Dance Music over the past 2 years.  Electro House and Dubstep (and other) producers and DJs have brought the music genre into the mainstream, and popularity is currently at a ridiculous high.  Above &amp; Beyond have continued to capture the attention of old fans while still raking in new ones.  Which made for quite a crowded site.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp"  /></p><p>I've seen Epic (or The Quest) more crowded than it was last night, and still had a fantastic time.  But the crowd was a different beast than what I expect from Minneapolis.  Almost every time I've attended a DJ event in Minneapolis, the crowd is friendly.  They'll give you space, smile at you when you're dancing around, and be quite courteous and mindful of others.</p><p>Kids these days...  It's all pushing and shoving, and crowding out others while making more space for yourself.  Or maybe it's because it feels like the true fans of Minneapolis are STARVED for the type of music that pioneered the scene in the first place.  Now, if a remotely decent international DJ finally makes their back way to Minneapolis, every one remoted interested shows up, nerd or not.  Not to mention the #5 DJ Act in the world, Above &amp; Beyond.</p><p>I expect this kind of behavior from the crowds in Chicago, but Minneapolis?  And at a Trance show?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp"  /></p><p>Crowd mentality wasn't the only that has changed since the last time.</p><p>In order to stay relevant, Above &amp; Beyond have adapted to the changes in the EDM landscape with their own sound.  They have somewhat shifted away from the uplifting melodic sounds that blew me away 2 1/2 years ago, to more mainstream modern day trance, ala Armin van Buuren.  Their huge single last year, Sun &amp; Moon, is a perfect example of keeping some hints of melody while totally succuming to hard Trance beats.</p><p>I was very very hopeful, when they began their set with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c">Above &amp; Beyond - Filmic</a>, which is a beautiful track, but it turned into modern trance shortly after.  I was keeping track of everything they played, but it was pretty damn close to the Data Trasmission Podcast ep 200, and their Essential Mix last year.</p><p>Actually, one thing about those two mixes that I found absent in their set last night was the addition of some breaky tracks, or, at least, some breaky soundy tracks.  While the mixes were still modern day trance, it was refreshing to hear some of that mixed into it.  I don't recall hearing any of that last night.</p><p>Blah blah blah, complain complain complain... If I had picked up their new CD and listened to it a little more, I would have certainly been more prepared for modern day Above &amp; Beyond.  They should get Ocean Lab back together and make a follow up to Sirens of the Sea!</p><p>They did play On a Good (Metropolis) Day. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp"  /></p><p>I went up to Minneapolis with Fishy and Five.  Five had a great time.  He's more into the modern day Trance sound than I am, so he was absolutely in heaven the whole time.  Fishy was hopping around with her glue sticks (when we actually had a room), and attracted random people here and there.  Also, I was able to meet up with a childhood friend of mine, so the night turned out pretty great. :)</p><p>Once the night finished, Above &amp; Beyond exited the stage and raced back to the merch booth.  They blew right past Five as Jack Trash announced they're signing stuff at the merch booth.  Five turned around and was first in line for signed shit!  So, he picked up a $4 tour poster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp"  /></p><p>Only Paavo and Tony were signing things, though.  The third member, Jono, was not back there.  Actually, I never saw Jono on stage either.  Maybe he was waiting in the bus, or something.</p><p>Also, if you noticed the tour dates on that schedule, Minneapolis was the last stop on a 12-day concert binge for them.  Today was their first day off since last Tuesday.  And these 12 dates are almost the entire tour.  That's pretty crazy.  Though, I suppose if you have 3 members and only 2 of them are up on stage doing the work, it's not so bad.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/reuben-wu-of-ladytron-segredo-madison">Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They have negotiated a monthly (?) residency with Chicago local Dani Deahl, and they were able to get Reuben Wu from one of my favorite bands, Ladytron.  Rather than rescheduling, they just decided to role with it and have them both perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp"  /></p><p>Opening up for them were locals DJ Nick Nice and Mike Carlson.  Mike Carlson played a rather ridiculous set.  I think he fit almost every popular electronic dance genre into his set.  House, Techno, Electro, Electro House, Dubstep, Trance, and a little Acid House.  I (my phone) caught a couple of the tracks.</p><p>Steve Angello - Knas<br/>Freestylers - Cracks (Flux Pavilion Remix)<br/>Wolfgang - Illmerica<br/>Knife Party - Internet Friends<br/>Deadmau5 - Some Chords (i think?)</p><p>I though everything actually worked out quite well. Â Despite spanning all these genres, the whole set was pretty cohesive, and made sense.  It was rather interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dani Deahl</b></div><p>Dani Deahl took over a little bit before midnight.  She seems to have a lot of fans around the Midwest, and doesn't mind traveling up to Wisconsin to plays shows in Madison, or Milwaukee.  I've seen her before, opening up for JFK at The Mid.  That opening set was ok.  It didn't really seem like she was having much fun.  She was holding back.  She had to hold back, being a warm-up DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp"  /></p><p>Last night, she was able to completely let loose, and her set was fun for the most part.  She threw in several popular songs, but had an array of a few deeper tracks that really ripped up the crowd.  Here's some tracks I caught:</p><p>Calvin Harris - Awooga<br/>that Steve Aoki song<br/>iPhone marimba tone<br/>Swedish House Mafia - One</p><p>About halfway through her set, when she played that Steve Aoki song, I think things startedÂ deterioratingÂ for me.  And then she started throwing in more dubstep, and some ridiculous songs choices, like that track with an iPhone marimba tone drop?  What's the purpose of that song?  There's no musical reason for it what so ever.  Is the crowd supposed to laugh and say, "hurrr, it's that sound my phone makes"?  I hate dubstep (brostep).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Reuben Wu</b></div><p>Reuben Wu started around 1, and begin putting Dani's set to shame.  I feel like he started off a little dry, but after a few quick songs he tore into the crowd with a much harder edge.  I recorded the first half hour of his set.  I think it starts getting pretty damn good at the 14 minute mark.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o</a></p><p>I'm not really sure what genre this would be.  It's kinda of a mix of Electro House and Techno, I think.  I'm glad I recorded it because as the night (and drinking) progressed, my memory becomes less effective.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp"  /></p><p>It always interesting to see members of the band spin shit on their own.  I wonder imagine they play music they enjoy and draw some inspiration from.  I don't think Reuben threw in popular tracks to get people to like him.  I think he was a building a set he enjoyed and made sense.</p><p>Also, there was a decent crowd for Dani Deahl as she was throwing down tracks, but after Reuben took the stage, people started to slowly exit the club.  By the end, I think Segredo went from 400+ people down to 100. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Mira Aroyo @ The Rave last year</b></div><p>Apparently, all the members of Ladytron met in clubs in London while DJing back in the day, so I was always interested to hear what that might have sounded like.  Last year in Milwaukee, Mira Aroyo, one of the lead singers, was in Wisconsin as well.</p><p>It was a very odd night.  The Rave shacked her up in one of the side rooms, rather than either main room.  Only 50-70 people showed up throughout the night.  Most of those people were probably friends with the opening DJs.  (and) Beers were stupid expensive because it's The Rave, and that place is garbage.</p><p>Mira's mixing wasn't all that great, and her track selection wasn't very inspired.  She'd play a couple tracks, and then pick a remix of a Ladytron song. Play a few more tracks, then Ladytron remix again.  And the other tracks she played were either Electro, or Electro House, or Dubstep.  Mostly popular stuff.  It wasn't very cohesive, and she failed to build any kind of vibe.  The 70ish people there never really danced, so it was just a bunch of people standing around.</p><p>It was pretty awkward to begin with, but the most awkward moment was when she ended her set.  The crowd applauded, but then DEAD silence.  Mira gave a "Thank you", people clapped again, and dead silence again.  It was the saddest DJ event I've ever been to.</p><p>I like Mira quite a bit though.  I think she's my favorite member of Ladytron.  But after last night, I think Reuben is now my (secret) favorite.  Mira's set was pretty shallow.  And Reuben definitely proved he knows how to take command of the decks.  I'd be real interested to hear Helen and Daniel spin a set, but I doubt I'll ever have a chance to see that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago">Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He has had a residency at Ushuaia Beach Hotel, and hosting an event called "Never say Never."  As he puts it, this is chance for him to play any music he wants.  No expectations, no reservations.  Just spin all the tracks that give him inspiration from artists he loves and admires.</p><p>As such, the style of music is a bit different than his semi-typical Progressive House tone.  It's more light, semi-upbeat and rich Tech House.  But the feel is still Sasha.  The first time I heard a Never say Never, it was really odd.  The mixing and atmosphere was absolutely Sasha, but the music was all different.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha MixMag CD</b></div><p>You can take a listen for yourself. :)</p><p>For the November Issue of MixMag magazine, Sasha had the honor of developing and releasing a mix for their monthly guest CD.  Leading up to the actual release of the issue, Sasha mentioned heading back to the studio after a summer of traveling and playing various gigs.  And out of that came a few new tracks, along with some edits, and wonderful arrangement.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp"  /></p><p>1.

Out of all the times I've Sasha over the last 10 years, i have NEVER seen his as energetic, on having as much fun, or generally happy to spin his tracks.  He was moving around in the booth all night, shaking hands with the happy people up front, and even gave out his headphones at the end of the night.  (He got them back, though, after he went up for 2 encores.)</p><p>Every other time I've seen him spin, he seems so into the vibe, and stoic that it's hard to tell if he's actually having fun.  Digweed is somewhat similar too.  They stand there the whole night, and build and build, layer and layer.  Perhaps they're too much into the technical aspects of mixing and set building to actually have fun?  Or maybe Sasha feels like he's being pigeon holed into a specific genre, and mixing in other stuff won't work with what he's already built.</p><p>But he was having the time of his life in the booth this night, and it completely fed the crowd.  For being as crowded as it was, everyone had a smile across their face.  Lots of hand shaking, high fives, and hugs.  Sasha's good vibes energized everyone there.</p><p>It was very different than the (semi) normal douchebaggery crowd that tends to show up to a Chicago club.  Maybe the horrible weather scarred them away.  Or maybe because the crowd was 80% dude, there weren't any chicks around to bring out the douchebag clubber within.  Or it could be a combination that resulted in actual Sasha fans braving the weather, and filling the majority of the club.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and was holding my camera in the air the whole time to capture the audio.  All the video is up on youtube right now, with a bit of a tracklist.</p><p>Playlist //<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6</a></p><p>Chris Walsh<br/>0.

Two of the very best in Progressive House, Two of the my favorite DJs, Two of my idols, Two legends, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo made a stop at Sound-Bar in Chicago on their brief USA tour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/7wxA7.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p>I have been a fan of Nick Warren not too long after I started really getting into Sasha.  Much like Sasha, he's a huge proveyor of a layered, building sound, but adds his own rich ambient flair to the mix.  It was his mix for Global Underground #24 that hooked me for life, though I think his set from <a href="http://hybridized.org/sets/839" title="http://hybridized.org/sets/839">Tonic in 2004</a> illustrates the vibe from that time much better.  His ambient sounds builds a warm, comfortable atmosphere, that builds throughout the night into massive energy.</p><p>Nick Warren is one-half of Way out West with Jody Wisternoff.  Way out West is responsible for some of the best and influential acid house, trance, and progressive trance hits over the last 15 years.</p><p>Nick has two radio shows.  He flexs his ambient sound on Frisky Radio every 2 months for Sound Garden.  And he has another show on Delta FM which he does every 2 months, also.  He usually posts them on his soundcloud page, so give 'em a listen: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren" title="http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren">http://soundcloud.com/djnickwarren</a></p><p>For Hernan Cattaneo, I became a fan of his more recently.  His deep progressive house doesn't always resonate with me, but his live sets build an immense vibe that is unforgettable.  I missed his solo performance earlier this year at The Mid, so I was grateful to get another chance to see him so soon. :)</p><p>With Sasha and Digweed, I consider the 4 of them, the kings of Progressive House.  All of them are good friends, and tend to spin together at events.  They usually all get together for the bedrock boat cruise during the Winter Music Conference in Miami.</p><div class='title'><b>Sound Bar</b></div><p>Sound Bar did a horrible job promoting this event.  I only knew about it from Nick Warren's facebook page back in October.  Sound Bar said nothing about the event at all.  The promotion company, React, said nothing either despite promoting events into February already.  It wasn't until 2 weeks ago, when the event finally showed up on Sound Bar's webpage, and THEN react actually started promoting it.  So many people didn't even know this was going on until it was too late.</p><p>Sound Bar usually has a line around the block for weekend events, and there were only 4 or 5 groups of people in front of us when Five and I showed up a little bit before 11pm.  DESPITE that it still took 25 minutes to get into the building.  The lines bottleneck at the hostesses inside the door looking up names on the RSVP list.  They usually take about 3-4 minutes per person, unless you're a VIP or whatever.  She couldn't find my name, for some reason &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Throughout the night, Five and I went to the bar for some drinks.  Later in the evening, when I went to get some water, one of the bartenders was just talking with his friends off to the side not paying attention to the bar.  The other bartender was looking around at people, but didn't actually wait on someone until after 10 seconds of eye contact.  When she finally saw me, she started getting drinks for people right in front of her instead.  It was so bad for Five earlier in the night, that he just went downstairs to the other bar.</p><div class='title'><b>Progressive House</b></div><p>But all that annoying nonsense didn't matter when Nick and Hernan took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9069.webp"  /></p><p>They started spinning around 11:30pm!  Five and I had only just arrived, and they were already up!  I don't think I've ever been to a club in Chicago were the headliners started before Midnight.  AND they continued on until the end of the night.  Over 4 hours of pure Progressive House madness.</p><p>Nick started off with a couple smooth opening pieces, and gave the decks over to Hernan who followed it up with a deep vibe.  They continued this trend through out the night.  Nick would played 3-5 songs, and Hernan would follow up with another 3-5 songs, and it would go back to Nick.</p><p>Nick seemed to be leading the night.  His miniture 20 minute sets would start off smooth and continue to build and build and build until the entire dance floor erupted in crazy cheers and dance.  He'd give the decks back to Hernan and he would keep the vibe at the top of the room with a follow up 20 minute set.  It was absolutely nuts how raw the night was.  It kept building and keeping the level high all night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>I'm not as familar with the tracks Hernan was spinning, but I definitely caught a bunch of Nick's tracks from recent sets of his.  My favorite moment of the night was Nick mixing his track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_qufBb32A" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_qufBb32A">Rumbletump</a> into his other track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8">Buenos Aires</a>.  My second favorite moment of the night was Hernan when he dropped <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU">Guy J &amp; Henry Saiz - Meridian</a>.</p><p><b>Edit!</b> I was wrong.  It was Eelke Kleijn's remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuPHok0FgMk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuPHok0FgMk">Water Games</a> being mixed into Buenos Aires.  Still my favorite moment of the night, though.  I love both those songs :)</p><p>I recorded the first 3 hours of the night, which can be found on youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5C4BD6C22D412E86</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>It was an incredible rare ocassion that two of the biggest names in Progressive House teamed up for a unique massive event.  The entire crowd continued to rock out hard all night, and had nothing but smiles on their faces.  I think this is the first event I've ever been to in Chicago, where (pretty much) every one was getting along, and being friendly for a change.  Though, I think the nerds were in great attendance, so there weren't a lot of girls around on the dance floor messing everything up.</p><p>This was definitely the highlight of the year for me, and definitely in the top 5 music experiences of my life.  It's up there with Sasha from 2003, Hybrid in 2004, Junkie XL is 2004, and The Chemical Brothers last year.</p><p>Plus I got my copy of Global Underground 24 signed!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9087.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phantogram-high-noon-madison">Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Phantogram is an American indie band with members Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel.  According to wikipedia, they formed in 2007, but I don't think anyone really heard of them until 2009.  And 2010 is really when they got their "big break", so to speak.</p><div class='title'><b>Eyelid Movies Tour</b></div><p>I was introduced to them last year, right as they started their first national tour for the release of their upcoming debut album, <b>Eyelid Movies</b>.  I saw them on the upcoming board for High Noon Saloon, and my brother, Bill, had mentioned that they were pretty good, and that I'd probably like them.  I listened to some of their songs, and definitely liked them indeed.</p><p>On my birthday last year was when they came into Madison, and my local record store, Strictly Discs, had them put on an intimate in-store performance limited to 50 people.  I got down there the moment they opened up, and made sure to secure my place in line.  Well, it turned out that not a lot of people had heard of this.  Or they weren't interested.  I came back around 3pm when they were actually performing, and was 1 out about 30 people who listened to their short 30 minute set.</p><p>It was pretty fantastic.  They have a very melodic tone that builds a very ambient atmosphere, followed with a drum beat that guides the melodic and chorus of songs.  It's relaxing, but still energetic.  It paints a picture in my mind, every time I hear their songs.</p><p>I recorded the whole performance, last year: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4" title="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4</a></p><p>After they finished, everyone met upstairs for a quick meet-and-greet.  They brought along Vinyl copies of their yet unreleased album.  So I bought one of those, and got it signed by Josh and Sarah.  Unfortunately, I missed their performance at The High Noon later on due to birthday drinking.</p><p>Birthday Drinking wasn't a problem this year, because they came into town one day after. And the concert was on a Monday night, so I wasn't about to get shit-faced on a work night.</p><div class='title'><b>Nightlife Tour</b></div><p>It had been a while since I heard anything about Phantogram.  I saw them on High Noon's upcoming list, and had wondered if they were going to perform anything new since last year.  All of the concerts I had heard leading up to last year, were the same 11 tracks from their album.</p><p>Once again, my brother Bill sent me a link for an upcoming mini-album titled <b>Nightlife</b>.  It had 6 songs, but it still gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard them.  Some songs were rather similar to their earlier stuff.  But others actually iterated on their style, went in a few different directions, but kept their sound in tact.  I really like <b>Turning into Stone</b>, which seems to channel Moby but keeps it in their own voice.</p><p>Last night, they performed at The High Noon Saloon to a sold out crowd.  Sold out! on a Monday night, even.  Phantogram's popularity is exploding right now.  Many critics have very high praise for <b>Nightlife</b>, and even publications such as Wired are even commenting on them.  It's kind of crazy.  I doubt it would be possible to do an intimate in-store performance with them as the place would be overrun.</p><p>Along with greater popularity and a greater crowd, their stage performance has expanded.  They hired a drummer, rather than using a drum looping kit, or whatever.  Using a live drummer really makes their sound POP even more than before.  <b>They are much better live now.</b> Before it just sounded the same.</p><p>They brought along a bunch of lazers and lights too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp"  /></p><p>The crowd at the High Noon was interesting.  There were plenty of girls, hipsters, and kids totally into the indie scene.  They probably follow pitchfork, who have been talking this band up.  Right in the front were a bunch of bros whom I wouldn't think would attend such a show.  In fact, they were the most into Phantogram out of the whole audience.  They were probably drunk, but their hands were in the air the whole time, and they were rockin' out.  They bought me beer, too. :)</p><p>I recorded some video, but I mostly took a bunch of pictures.  I think I took enough notes to identify their set list, too.</p><p>1. ???

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, Five and I went down to Chicago to check out Amon Tobin's tour of his new album ISAM.  His tour included a crazy 3D visualization stage setup designed specifically with his album in mind, and is still currently touring across North America.  From the youtube clips I've seen of the show, it looked pretty neat.</p><p>Here is the trailer for his tour: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI</a></p><p>While the trailer represents what you see on the stage, it has a bunch of audience reactions, which leads me to believe their intended audience is the older, married, family crowd.  These are the types of trailers you'd see for the Blue Man Group, or magicians, or some stupid movie.  The type of trailer that's designed to get those boring people out of their houses and day-to-day lives, and experience something different for a change.</p><p>I'm not sure if they aired that trailer on TV, but the crowd in the Congress Theater was a bit different than the usual EDM crowd I'd expect in Chicago.  Sure, there were plenty of kids who most likely listen to dubstep and electro on the weekends.  As well as the crowd you'd find in clubs on the weekends.  But, there were also those couples who might have seen a commercial, such as the trailer, and figured they could use a night out for a change.  While the normal crowd was pushing and shoving their way around, the married crowd were respectful and nice about how packed the place was.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Opening for Amon Tobin was <b>Emika</b>, who was the official tour opener.  I really don't remember much of her set at all.  We got there about 10 minutes before she finished.  But before Amon Tobin took the stage, they sandwiched in a local opener, <b>Lorn</b>.  Lorn is one half of local electronica group <b>Omega Clash</b>, whose other half is <b>adoptahighway</b>.  I've seen adoptahighway before, and he's pretty slick.  Lorn wasn't too bad either.  He performed a somewhat downtempo, slightly experimental, yet banging set.  It was perfect for keeping the mood solid, while keeping the energy low in anticipation for Amon.</p><p>Lorn finished close to 11pm, and it took a little while for Amon to get everything setup.  I think he finally started around 11:30pm.  The curtains pulled up, and revealed the gigantic geometry stage thingy.  For the most part, it served as a canvas for the visualizations being blasted onto it from the projector right behind Five and I.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp"  /></p><p>The stage presence was huge, and reflected and reacted to the music. Amon Tobin's set was basically playing his new album ISAM from start to finish, with a little improvisation between tracks, but it didn't seem like much.  I hadn't listened to the album ahead of time, but I dunno...  It didn't really speak to me at all.  It was experimental in nature, and didn't really have any groove to it.  Without a constant beat to frame the sounds, it didn't capture my interest.</p><p>After Amon finished ISAM, he exited his contraption, got up a stage, and took a bow.  And went back inside for an encore.  After his encore, he did the same thing, and came back for a second encore.  The style of his first encore was much more drum 'n bass than experimental, and his second encore was kinda in the middle of his two styles.  I'm guessing that his started off as drum 'n bass, and eventually moved into experimental later.</p><div class='title'><b>ISAM v. Shpongletron</b></div><p>Earlier in year, Fishy, Chaos and I saw Shpongle as he rolled in Madison on tour with his own crazy stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  It has wings on the side, and an eye on the top that were made out of LEDs and had several visualizations programmed into them.  In the center sat the Shpongle head.  It would illuminate itself, and the colors would change.  The light source on the head would change as well, which was somewhat trippy to think of how it was doing that.  But then it moved!  The head twisted and contorted.  It would stick its tongue out at you.  It was really interesting to see, mainly because I wasn't expecting that at all.  And there wasn't a projector around either, so I really wasn't sure how that was happening.</p><p>Here's video I took from that show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWf</a> at the 18 minute mark.</p><p>With Amon Tobin's ISAM stage setup, that suspension of disbelief was never there.  The huge projectors in the middle of the floor shone like a spotlight on the stage, and you could clearly see the geometry of the stage setup for what it was.  Plus, there were few times when the visualizations actually took advantage of the cubed nature of the structure.  And even then, you could clearly tell it was being painted on by the projector.</p><p>It really wasn't until Amon's second encore when the visualization reached the level I had experienced with the Shpongletron.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp"  /></p><p>It painted a bunch of stacked cubes on the structure, and they twisted, and collapsed several times.  It was subtle and fit with the design, so it looked believable (at least until they fell over).  The whole rest of the show was way too deliberate.  Some of it would have been better off using a giant LED display instead.</p><p>Overall, it was alright.  Amon Tobin is part of the Ninja Tune record label.  And while I'm a big fan of that label, I think I need to remind myself that their music is very hit-or-miss with me.  Some experimental really grooves and speaks to me, but I think I need to be in a certain mood to receive it properly.  Otherwise, it falls flat :/<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/events/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
