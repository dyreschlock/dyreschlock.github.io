| October 5, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I listen to a lot of music.  While almost all of this music falls into electronica, and mostly dance and DJ music from there, I try to branch out a bit and find artists that sound different than the rest, or ones that sound totally amazing to me.  This is probably how most DJs cultivate and shape their careers.  At least the ones that actually grow and continue to be relevant, while others drown in the minutia of popular tracks from others.</p><p>I find some pretty amazing music, but end up moving on to the next thing after a while.  As such, I lose track of the artist.  And tend to forget about them, and not really notice if they create anything new, or how their career changes and sound evolves over time.  I never really understand them anymore than a single or few tracks from a particular moment in time.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>But there are a few musicians that I've kept track of over multiple years, and tend to shape my own opinion and taste in music.  One of these bands is <b>Ladytron</b>.  Ladytron has four members, Mira and Helen trade off singing vocals, while Daniel and Reuben are always on synths in the background.   I started listening to these guys towards the end of college in 2005 and 2006.</p><p>They've been around since 1999, and if I heard some of their tracks from the beginning, I probably would have shrugged them off and went on to something else.  In fact, who knows...  I probably did back in the day, and don't remember.  Most of their original songs were kinda emo and seemed to speak to teenage girls.  Their first two albums consisted of several songs dealing with boyfriends and modeling.</p><div class='title'><b>Witching Hour + Velocifero</b></div><p>Around the time I started listening to them, their sound had evolved.  Their third album, Witching Hour (2005), focused much more on the beat and progression of the songs, rather than the lyrics.  The lyrics served as flavor text to captivate the audience, while the beat hooks them in.  "High Rise", "Destroy Everything You Touch", "International Dateline", and "Fight in Built up areas" are all pretty bad ass.  I think <b>High Rise</b> might be my favorite song.</p><p>Velocifero (2008), their fourth album, continued with their more layered rocking atmosphere, but seemed to dial a little bit back, rather than push forward.  Ladytron went on tour in early 2009, which is when I saw them for the first time.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago" title="/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago">Ladytron @ Metro, Chicago // April 4th, 2009</a></p><p>After they finished up the tour, it seemed like they disappeared.  They didn't produce any new music.  They didn't go on tour.  They hardly did anything at all.  Apparently, there was rumor of them breaking up circulating last year.  I think Helen and Mira went off and worked on some new things of their own, while Daniel and Reuben worked on some new songs.</p><div class='title'><b>Gravity the Seducer</b></div><p>And then, early this year, it seemed like a flood of Ladytron news hit the Internet.  They had a brand new single, and an upcoming compilation album focusing on their first ten years, as well as a remix album.  In the middle of the year, they announced their fifth album, Gravity the Seducer, along with a tour promoting the CD!</p><p>While some of the songs on their new CD follow the same vein as Velocifero, Gravity the Seducer has several tracks that are much more ambient than anything they've done before.  It's somewhat odd because the two sounds don't really compliment each other.  <em>White Elephant</em>, <em>Ace of Hz</em>, and <em>Mirage</em> build up the album with their classic sound,  while <em>White Gold</em>, <em>Moon Palace</em>, <em>Altitude Blues</em> etc bring it to a different place.</p><p>I wonder if this inconsistency was born from their unofficial hiatus and rumored breakup.  Maybe Reuben and Daniel were working on this direction when Mira and Helen came back.</p><div class='title'><b>Tour in Minneapolis!</b></div><p>Anyway, last night!, their North American tour came through Minneapolis.  I rented a car, and met up with my little sister to see them live.  The Fine Line Music Cafe is a fantastic venue where I've seen some of my favorite concerts of all time, including Hybrid on <a href="/old/v7/hybrid" title="/hybrid">November 14th, 2003</a> and Moby on <a href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis" title="/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">October 5th, 2009</a>.</p><p>The place slowly filled up with fans, and the crowd was rather diverse and odd.  You had your typical hipster-like youth, and the slightly older alternative crowd.  There were also a couple of punkers there.  And the typical concert going music lovers, like myself.  In addition, there were several older patrons who I would not expect to find at the place.  One of these guys even talked with me at length at how he's such a fan of Ladytron, and how no one he knows has even heard of them before.  I wonder if this is how it'll be for me in 15 years.</p><p>Musician Sonoio was on opening duties, and he warmed up the crowd with his eclectic music.  I'm not really sure how to describe his music.  It was definitely experimental, but felt like it had a tinge of Japanoise thrown on top.  Not like over the top Japanoise, but a more mellow ambient rendition.  I dunno...  His music did not speak to me.  And the crowd swayed back and forth to his performance in anticipation of the main act.</p><p>Sonoio finished up, and started packing away his stuff.  Ladytron roadies took the stand, and performed sound checks.  One of the roadies pasted the set list to the floor...  Well...  Now I know exactly what they're going to play for the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp"  /></p><p>The set list is as follows:</p><p>1. <b>Soft Power</b> - Witching Hour<br/>2. <b>International Dateline</b> - Witching Hour<br/>3. <b>Mirage</b> - Gravity the Seducer<br/>4. <b>Ghosts</b> - Velocifero (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fTy8_fQJaI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fTy8_fQJaI">video</a>)<br/>5. <b>High Rise</b> - Witching Hour<br/>6. <b>True Mathematics</b> - Light &amp; Magic<br/>7. <b>White Gold</b> - Gravity the Seducer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfsI9qwiBis" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfsI9qwiBis">video</a>)<br/>8. <b>Runaway</b> - Velocifero<br/>9. <b>Ace of Hz</b> - Gravity the Seducer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5upN1DY6U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5upN1DY6U">video</a>)<br/>10. <b>Little Black Angel</b> - Best of 00-10<br/>11. <b>Discotraxx</b> - 604<br/>12. <b>Fighting in Built up Areas</b> - Witching Hour<br/>13. <b>Seventeen</b> - Light &amp; Magic</p><p>Encore:  (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l4a-gJXY8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l4a-gJXY8">video</a>)<br/>1. <b>White Elephant</b> - Gravity the Seducer<br/>2. <b>Destroy Everything You Touch</b> - Witching Hour</p><div class='title'><b>Performance</b></div><p>Ladytron were pretty damn awesome.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>They actually sounded much better than I've ever heard them live before.</p><p>In all of the live recordings on their albums, they always sounded a bit off.  The levels never matched the album versions of their songs.  The drums were either too loud, or not enough.  Some of the synths weren't harmonizing together.  It was a muted experience.  And that was reflected when I saw them in 2009.  It was the exact same sound as their live stuff.</p><p>But that wasn't the case this time.  Not only were all the levels at the perfect balance, and everything harmonized together, it was amplified ten fold and actually engulfed the audience in the atmosphere present from their fantastic songs of Witching Hour.  Also, I was right up from next to the speaker, so that helped too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp"  /></p><p>With the exception of Gravity the Seducer, I've listening to their other songs over and over again, so there weren't many surprises that came out of the night.  The whole audience kept in a constant groove as Ladytron went down their set list.  I kind of wish I hadn't seen that ahead of time.  &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Things did change when they hit "Fighting in Built up Areas."  That song really popped, and threw down a dancey beat.  Everyone was hopping around.  My little sister wasn't too impressed with the evening until they hit this beat.</p><p>Overall, I thought the concert was pretty fantastic.  These songs have never sounded as great as they did in The Fine Line.  Listening to their album version doesn't do the night justice.  I recorded a couple moments from the night, but I think "Fighting in Built up Areas", "High Rise", and "Little Black Angel" were the highlights for me.</p><p>Also!  My little sister and I got a poster of "White Elephants" signed by Mira, Helen, Reuben and Daniel.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp"  /></p><p>Score!</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tiesto @ Aliant Energy Center" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tiesto-aliant-energy-center">Tiesto @ Aliant Energy Center</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 19, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For his "College Invasion" Fall tour, larger than life, trance superstar DJ Tiesto, made Madison, WI one of his stops.  What?  It's kinda odd thinking about Tiesto performing in Madison.</p><p>Though, given how the scene has been exploding around here, and local bookers have been getting some serious talent to come to our town, AND how this is a college tour and Madison is one of top 10 schools in the country, I guess it makes sense.  This is a DJ concert anyway.  He's not playing in some fancy douche bag club.</p><p>Tickets were a mere $37, which is cheap compared to almost any gig in the last 5 years.Â  Also, he took the trouble to come to my town.Â  He's bringing the show to me!Â  I can walk to the damn concert.Â  So, I decided to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Merchandising</b></div><p>To prove just how big a sellout he is, upon entering the lobby of the Alliant Energy Center, I'm greeted with several booths selling and advertising shit.</p><p>There's Tiesto's merchandise booth with a whole lot of overpriced T-Shirts, and other crap.  There's a photo booth!  You can get your picture standing next to a picture background of Tiesto!  Hot Damn!  There was a booth that had the Playstation Move setup showing off some game.  There was a booth with energy drinks.  And another for Axe Body spray.</p><p>I think the bigger offense was during Porter Robinson's opening set.  The huge LED display behind would switch to ads! Which advertised the merchandise booth out in the lobby.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp"  /></p><p>People love rockin' out to T-Shirts!</p><div class='title'><b>Porter Robinson</b></div><p>Opening for Tiesto was Porter Robinson.  I got there around 8:30pm, so I caught the last half hour of his set before Tiesto began at 9pm.  As I entered, he was jammin to a remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4">Deadmau5 - Raise your Weapon</a> that sounded like Madeon's fantastic remix.  It was much longer, and the extended parts didn't sound like it at all, so maybe it was a mashup, or something.</p><p>He set was pretty cookie cutter.  He played songs similar to what I've heard the locals spin around here.  He threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc">Wolfgang Gartner - Illmerica</a> towards the end, which felt like he was going for the popular vote, rather than building his own sound.  (At least, I think it was Illmerica.  It was some well known Wolfgang song.)</p><p>But whatever, I only caught the last half hour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Tiesto</b></div><p>Man, I got there at the perfect time.  I didn't have to stand through any of the openers at all.  30 minutes after I arrived, Tiesto took the stage and started up his set.</p><p>I got the recorded the first 70 minutes of this (plus a few other clips), so take a look for yourself.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627</a></p><p>He starts off which a self indulging intro.  It's probably the club life theme song.  After he throws in a sample of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk">Imogen Heap - Hide &amp; Seek</a> (I thought it was BT at first), and starts hopping from trance anthem to trance anthem, and eventually goes into more Big Room (or whatever) House.  He pretty much kept with the Housey trend throughout the rest of the set, though some songs still kept a trancey vibe.  It's the kind of sound that he's known for these days.</p><p>He DID throw in a few classic tracks, which was a pleasant surprise.  One of which was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw">Delerium - Silence (Tiesto Remix)</a>.  Only it WASN'T the Tiesto Remix!  Arrgghh.  It was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4">W&amp;W + Jonas Stenberg Remix.</a> This song is evil.  It uses the exact same build up as the Tiesto mix, but then shits all over itself with a breaky climax, rather than the beautiful atmospheric sound of the original.  Fuck this song.</p><p>I caught a few other songs too, but I don't remember their names.  (I did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0">record</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ">them</a>, though.)

This is the exhibition hall in the Alliant Energy Center.  A huge room surrounded by concrete and steel.  And, as Zack reminds me, the same place were they have horse shows, and monster truck rallies.  It's the same basic layout as an airline hanger.</p><p>The accoustics are horrible.  The bass bounces off all the walls, and makes a thunderous sound that echos through the entire space.  It drowns out any actual noise from the bass itself.  It turns into this Boom-Boom-Boom.  So, every bass line is identical throughout the set.  You can hear this quite plainly in the video I took.</p><p>The rest of the levels were jacked up, so you COULD make out what the songs actually were.  But even that had echo in this huge concrete hall.  Certainly not as much echo as the bass, but it still blurred the songs a tad.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>A Good Time</b></div><p>While, I'm pretty down on Tiesto, and he is a total sellout and a bit of a hack, I had a great time.  But, with my expectations so damn low to begin with, there's no place to go but up!</p><p>The crowd was quite amazing, too.  I think that was the biggest surprise for me.  There were some college kids there, but they were mostly in the huge bit in front of the stage.  Hanging back in the comfortable section were the actual fans.  Tiesto fans maybe, but definitely Trance fans.  Clubbers from Chicago and Milwaukee, and a bunch of kids that just wanted to dance and have fun.  There weren't any huge assholes.</p><p>When Tiesto hit on his mark with the Trance hits, everyone in the crowd was dancing and cheering.  Everyone was totally in the moment with this concert.  People were actually paying attention!  Rather than typing on their phone, or yelling at each other, or trying to feel each other up.</p><p>I haven't seen a crowd this responsive in a while.  But maybe this could be because it was on a weekday rather than a weekend, and people weren't drinking the night away.  And most trance fans are older than the new crop of EDM fans who are into dubstep, electro house, and all that stuff.</p><p>I had fun :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp"  /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I wrote about my excitement leading up to the event a few weeks ago --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">here</a>.</p><p>I wrote that after a couple of their sets were recorded from the previous weekend and starting floating around the Internet.  The Beta Nightclub set from June 16th, and their Electric Daisy Carnival set from July 18th.  Both were very similar, and had a very unique sound that proved Gabriel &amp; Dresden had returned.</p><div class='title'><b>Style</b></div><p>While technically they fall under the Trance genre, they play a lot of tracks all over the place.  One of key parts of their sound is incorporating the current sound of dance music into their sets and into their tracks.  So they'll throw in some Skrillex and Wolfgang with the vocals to their tracks and others on top of them.</p><p>Given those recorded sets from June, I figured that we would hear something similar in Chicago, and that was absolutely the case.  Like I nerd, I stood there and recorded the whole thing, and have posted it to youtube.  Even recording kinda seemed like redundant as those two other sets are much much better quality than what my camera could do.  But, at least it gives us the opportunity to get a tracklist of the entire night and maybe capture a few deviations.</p><p>Here's the youtube link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349</a></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>The tracklist was pretty easy to develop given the amount of overlap.  There are a few wholes in my list, though.  Only 8 IDs!  Not bad...</p><p>1. Justice &amp; DJ DLG vs Gabriel &amp; Dresden - Tracking Civilzation Down (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>2. Afrojack vs. Way Out West feat. Tricia Lee Kelshall - Replica Of Mindcircus (Dave Dresden Mashup)<br/>3. ID<br/>4. Gabriel &amp; Dresden vs. Fedde Le Grand - Dust In The Control Room (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>5. tyDi vs. Mumbai Science feat. Boston - More Than A Gold Dream (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>6. Deep Dish vs. Wolfgang Gartner &amp; Francis Preve - Say Hello vs. Yin (Josh Gabriel Mashup)</p><p>7. Benny Benassi feat. Gary Go - Cinema (Laidback Luke Remix w/ Skrillex Remix)<br/>8. Groove Armada - Get Down (Henrik B Mix)<br/>9. Gabriel &amp; Dresden feat. Jes pres. Motorcycle - As The Rush Comes (DJ Kue Remix)<br/>10. Mumford &amp; Sons - Little Lion Man (Sander van Doorn Remix)<br/>11. Clashback vs. Michael Woods vs. R.E.M. - Losing My Outset (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>12. Funkagenda &amp; Adam K - Drift<br/>13. 68 BEATS - Replay the night (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mix)<br/>14. Moby - Wait for me (Laidback Luke Remix)</p><p>15. Enrique Iglesias vs. Fatboy Slim - Tonight (Dresden &amp; Johnston Remix) vs. Star 69 (Acapella)<br/>16. Calvin Harris - Awooga (Original Mix)<br/>17. Andain - Promises (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix)<br/>18. ID<br/>19. Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit (Myon &amp; Shane 54 Bootleg)<br/>20. Arty &amp; Mat Zo - Rebound (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Edit)<br/>21. Gabriel &amp; Dresden feat. Jan Burton - Dangerous Power (Original Mix)</p><p>22. ID (New?!)<br/>23. Sied van Riel &amp; Radion 6 - Radiator (Original Mix)<br/>24. ID w/ Gabriel &amp; Dresden - Tracking Treasure Down (Acapella)<br/>25. Above &amp; Beyond feat. Richard Bedford - Sun &amp; Moon (Dave Dresden Re-Edit)<br/>26. ID<br/>27. Josh Gabriel pres. Winter Kills - Deep Down (Josh Gabriel Remix)<br/>28. ID</p><p>29. Cold Blue - Lucidity<br/>30. Above &amp; Beyond feat. Zoe Johnston - No One On Earth (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix)</p><p>Leading into the weekend, Gabriel &amp; Dresden announced on Facebook that they were going to premiere a brand new song that they had just finished.  I think it's #22 on my list.</p><div class='title'><b>Duo</b></div><p>One thing that I found interesting about their performance was that they were both handling the controls during the entire night.  Both previous times I've seen G&amp;B in clubs, one of them would spin some discs, and halfway through the night, they'd switch.  Granted this was in 2004, back when they still had vinyl.</p><p>For Gabriel &amp; Dresden, I consider them to have 3 eras on distinct sound.  There's everything prior to 2004, 2004 to 2008 when they broke up, and their current sound in 2011 now that they've been reunited.  I wonder if they were spinning more as a concurrent duo towards the end in 2008, or if they were still separate as was the case in 2004.  Well, they definitely feel like a cohesive duo today. :)</p><div class='title'><b>The Mid</b></div><p>Overall, I had a great time.  Even though it was packed, it wasn't crotch-to-crotch packed, though some people seemed to think it was.  I still had room to move around, and rock out to the music.  Of course, I stayed in the exact same spot for 3 hours.  I didn't have to move through the crowds of people behind me.</p><p>The Mid has a very odd layout.  The dance floor is split up into two halves.  You have the front half in front of the stage that is completely clear and where all the dancing happens.  The back half, is completely roped off and filled with reserved tables for bottle service.  While, it seems perfect for those people who want to (or can) spend $500+ going to The Mid, and get a fantastic location in the club all to yourself, it's pretty horrible for us cheap (or budgeted) assholes who only pay for General Admission.  The reserved tables choke out the flow of human traffic from the back to the front.  The entire area surrounding that VIP is completely blocked off by bodies upon bodies of people trying to get somewhere else.  You have to shove your way through, basically.</p><p>But whatever, it's a nightclub.  If you want service or better treatment, shell out the cash.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ The Congress Theater, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-awakening">The Spring Awakening @ The Congress Theater, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Spring Awakening 2010 was the last one night event, they did before skipping 2011, and having the 2-day festival in 2012.  More on that one here: <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">July 21st, 2012</a>.</p><p>The Headlining lineup for 2010 was <b>Above & Beyond</b>, <b>Benny Benassi</b>, and <b>Second Sun</b> (Live).</p><p>Five and I went there together.  We arrived as opener <b>DJ BeBe</b> was finishing his set.  <b>Erik K</b> took over the opening duties soon after.  Both were fantastic openers. :)</p><p><b>Second Sun</b> were next, and they performed a great live set of their songs.  <b>Benny Benassi</b> was next.  I had not heard his music prior to the night.  He played some rather interesting tracks that really set his set apart from anything I had heard before.  Crazy drops and breaks in the atmosphere.</p><p>But, after seeing them in 2009, I was super excited to see <b>Above & Beyond</b>, and also introduce them to Five. :)  I felt like their 2009 performance at Epic was much more "magical".  At Epic, they felt much more connected to the crowd.  The Congress was just way too big to make that connection.  But they still were fantastic.  Here are thoughts on that event: <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">November 23rd, 2009</a>.</p><p><br/>Here are videos I took of the whole evening: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6</a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/paul-oakenfold-epic-minneapois">Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This night was a really great throwback.  Before Paul Oakenfold took the stage, Jack Trash addressed the crowd and talked about The Quest.  </p><p>"Do any of you remember the last time Paul Oakenfold was here?  It was in 2004, back when this place was The Quest.  It was dank, and dirty."</p><p>Aww, The Quest wasn't that bad. :/  But, I definitely remember.

I love living in a town where all the great venues, bars, and other attractions are all in one small area.  A town large enough to foster, nurture, and bring in some amazing talent.  Yet, small enough that I can get anywhere in 30 minutes at most. ^_^  Especially when it's January and the weather is horrible.</p><p><b>Dustin Zahn @ High Noon</b> // Jan 15th</p><p>Last weekend, we caught word of some amazing music at the High Noon and stopped there for the evening.  The air was filled with an amazing energy of raw techno, house and a little electro.  Dustin Zahn kept the crowd moving all night long.

The whole night gave off the vibe of a mid-90s rave.  The kind that were prevalent in niche corners of the USA, and especially in Minneapolis.  The Minneapolis rave scene gave birth to the amazing talent and fans that surge in Minneapolis today.  Last weekend was a glimpse into that pure energy.</p><p><b>Holy F*ck @ Majestic</b> // Jan 22nd</p><p>This weekend, Madison played host to Toronto's "must-see live act" Holy Fuck.  Apparently, these guys have "redefined" what it means to give a live performance by using their raw common-sense genius to build up new songs and sounds that make every one of their shows unique.</p><p>Unfortunately...  they conducted a DJ set.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>They played some pretty awesome songs.  And after hearing what I recorded, some of the other songs sound pretty good too.  But, they came at the tail end of a horrible performance by a DJ duo known as the Fun Cartel.</p><p>The Fun Cartel are two guys with opposing musical tastes and skill.  The skinny afro guy was pretty cool.  But his sidekick would throw in tracks that completely ruined the vibe.  In addition, they failed almost each one of their transitions.  In the end, their set felt like a 3 year old's finger painting.  "Let's just throw in all of our favorite songs.  Orange mixes with Blue, right?!"  Ugh..</p><p>Also, our dinner plans for the evening didn't go so hot either.</p><p><b>Erebus @ The Annex</b> // Jan 23rd</p><p>Erebus is not in my realm of music.  They are Metal.  And while their music is definitely different than mine, metal fans could not love their music more.  Metal fans are born to rock, congregate, and mosh together.  Erebus does an amazing job of channeling that passion, energy and fandom into something that anyone with a strong passion for music can love.</p><p>Examples:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Even though there were probably 30 people or less in attendance, Erebus performed with such enthusiasm and attention that everything they did on stage was clearly meant for us.  We were the reason they were on stage.  The songs they chose, the monologues spoken.. it was all for us.  And the true fans reciprocated by doing what Metal fans do:  Hopping off the stage, slamming into each other, head bangin', and truly rockin' out.</p><p>I've seen them a couple times before, but this was truly their best night, in my opinion.  Though, I might be semi-biased.  Erebus' lead members are Dave and Gage.  Gage is one of my good friends in Madison.  We met at Widen back when we were both interns.  I first saw them perform live almost exactly 3 years ago, when they first performed live themselves (<a href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show" title="/erebus-first-show">here</a>).</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways</b></div><p>Anyways, Madison is pretty amazing.  Great music at a small scale. Daedelus is coming to town in 3 weeks!Â  King Cannibal in 2.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Paul van Dyk @ The Kennedy, Tampa" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/paul-van-dyk-the-kennedy-tampa">Paul van Dyk @ The Kennedy, Tampa</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 29, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, after seeing <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Above &amp; Beyond in Minneapolis</a>, I compared the Electronic Dance scenes in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago.  I've always wanted to see how our little corner of the DJ world compared to the major hubs.  Tampa isn't a "major" hub by any means, but Miami absolutely is.  I figured that other major cities in Florida would have quite a bit of crossover.</p><p>I've been to Tampa 4 times now, and all previous times have turned out lame.  But the opportunity finally arose this Thanksgiving as Paul Van Dyk was in town!</p><div class='title'><b>The Kennedy</b></div><p>There was some back and forth as to which Venue he was going to be at.  He was originally scheduled to be at The Kennedy but they moved him over to The Ritz in Ybor City a couple months ago.  Then 2 weeks ago, they moved him back to The Kennedy.  I'm not sure why, but the email said "our original venue has been cleared for PVD, so we're back at The Kennedy."</p><p>The Kennedy is pretty fancy.  It's setup exactly like one of those Night clubs you'd see in some TV show based in Miami (CSI, Burn Notice).  There were lush velvet couches in corned rooms lining the walls, which were roped off for VIPs only.  The edges of the walls were lined shimmering lights.  The wood throughout the place had a cherry finish with intricate designs like an old armoire.  It was a fancy cush little place.</p><p>But that what it's biggest problem.  It was little.  It was about the same size of any bar you've ever been to.  Well, maybe just a little bit bigger.  The Bar area was placed in the middle of the building and consumed almost all the space.  It started at about 40 feet from the DJ booth and continued back from there.  The dance floor was not at all wide either.</p><p>Justin and I got to The Kennedy around 10:30p.  There weren't that many people there, but it was still dense.  An opening DJ was playing songs from somewhere, but the DJ booth was vacant.  Time went by as we waited for PVD to show up, and more and more people filtered into the place.</p><p>By the time Paul Van Dyk showed up at Midnight-ish, I could hardly move.  There were nearly 2000 people in this tiny fucking place.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp"  /></p><p>I have no idea why they decided stuffing us into a fancy little lounge bar was a great idea.  Rukes has some pictures of what The Ritz looks like here: <a href="http://photo.rukes.com/ritzybor/ritzybor.html" title="http://photo.rukes.com/ritzybor/ritzybor.html">http://photo.rukes.com/ritzybor/ritzybor.html</a>.  That would have been so much nicer.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul Van Dyk</b></div><p>Justin and I were crammed against the edge of the dance floor.  It worked out well since I would only have people knocking into me from 2 sides rather than all sides.  We were against a railing which kept us out of the VIP area.  When Paul arrived, he actually walked right past us on the way to the bar.  He hung out there while mini-Paul setup the decks for him.</p><p>20 minutes later he took the stage and pounded our ass with sound.  Here's the beginning:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UWax8OxmmZo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UWax8OxmmZo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>He played some amazing stuff throughout the night, but a lot of familiar titles.

There were some pretty cool people who were mindful of space and didn't push people around.  There were some that did, but for the most part everyone was there for the music.  As evidence by the kids on Trance Addict, there are a lot of devoted fans in Florida that will journey across the state for the music.  People weren't there to get shit-faced or noticed, they were there for Paul Van Dyk, and that's really how it should be.</p><p>I look forward to the next time some amazing DJ stops by Tampa when I'm there. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>November continues to sound with amazing talent in the midwest and this weekend was one of the biggest.  Above &amp; Beyond came through Minneapolis and Chicago.  And Deadmau5 stopped in Chicago and Detriot.  A couple of months ago, I started listening to Deadmau5 and was quite excited to find out he'd be in Chicago soon enough.  Well, after waiting too long to form a party, Deadmau5 sold out without me...  I was disappointed, but he'll be back.</p><div class='title'><b>Above &amp; Beyond</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6015.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6015.webp"  /></p><p>Yes, Above &amp; Beyond were my plan B for Friday Night...  BUT it was the best thing that could've happened.  Above &amp; Beyond played some beautiful uplifting trance that sparked my long forgotten love of the genre.  It's absolute candy to my ears.  This ended up being one of my absolute favorite nights of the year.</p><p>They began the night with their recent remix of Dirty Vegas "Tonight"</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/loVoLv2w_ng&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/loVoLv2w_ng&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>They also played one of their new songs, "On a Good Day"</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yON4kUqqjEA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yON4kUqqjEA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Both songs titles clearly describe the loving atmosphere of the night.</p><p>...and to complement to beautiful ear candy, was wonderful eye candy too..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6041.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6063.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_6077.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Electronic Dance Music</b></div><p>But, before the beauty, we were greeted with the sound of Boom Jinx, which was a perfect introduction back into Trance.  Boom Jinx played tracks nearly identical to the Trance I started off on around a decade ago.  The simple beauty of build ups and tear downs in an absolute aura of melody.  It was a warm feeling to hear that sound again.  But it certainly made me question the evening.</p><p>Over the past years, I've paid most attention to Sasha, Digweed, Moby, Ladytron, Way out West (Jody Wisternoff and Nick Warren), and the DJs of Hybridized.org.  Way out West was really my only link back to Trance, and both Jody and Nick are almost exclusively Progressive House now.  I've heard a few things from Armin and Paul Van Dyk, but never followed up.</p><p>It was odd to think that Trance hadn't evolved at all in the past 10 years, if this is what Trance today sounded like.  Of course, once Above &amp; Beyond took the stage and blew everyone away (ign dot com), I was foolish to have ever thought that.  Though, most of Above &amp; Beyond's set had a very House style to it, in a similar manor to how Paul Van Dyk sounds these days.  Once Trance, now a Housey Trance which PVD refers to simply as EDM, or <b>Electronic Dance Music</b>.</p><p>I find this odd, since the term itself implies it covers the entire genre of music, rather than just a sub-genre.  Maybe with using this blanket term, they're trying to get everyone else on earth to stop calling electronic music "Techno", and start calling it "Electronic Dance Music" or "EDM" or whatever.  It would make sense since most the <a href="http://www.djmag.com/top100" title="http://www.djmag.com/top100">Top 10 DJs in the World</a> play tracks in genres that either <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> EDM or at least orbit it.</p><p>Do people still refer to electronic music as "Techno" anyways?  The only group I can think of who might even be considered in that sub-genre are The Crystal Method.</p><div class='title'><b>Minneapolis</b></div><p>As mentioned before, this was Plan B for Friday Night.  Though, I could've saved the 4.5 hour drive to Minneapolis and gone to Above &amp; Beyond in Chicago (2.5 hour drive) on Saturday Night instead.  They were at Vision in Chicago, though, and I'm getting rather sick of that place.</p><p>The vast majority of people who go to Vision are those only interested in the night life rather than the music.  It was a bit of an eye opener going to the House of Blues are being completely surrounded with genuine fans, rather than a bunch of douche bags with popped collars, dark glasses, glamour muscles and are only there to be "seen".</p><p>Minneapolis' "scene" was born out of raves.  All of the kids back in the 90s who partied in barns and rundown community centers, run and contribute to the nightlife these days.  That genuine fandom and experience makes Minneapolis one of the best places in the nation to hear any EDM performance.</p><p>For proof of Minneapolis' fantastic electronic music community, you need only check out <a href="http://mnvibe.com/" title="http://mnvibe.com/">MN Vibe</a>, which was fostered and promoted talent for the past 8 years.  Not to mention, <a href="http://simshows.com/" title="http://simshows.com/">Sound In Motion</a> who are the ones that bring all the fantastic talent to Minneapolis.</p><div class='title'><b>Boom Jinx</b></div><p>But anyways, Boom Jinx played some pretty rad songs.  It was a lot of fun, until he started acting in that douche-baggy DJ manor.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_5990.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_5990.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091120_ab/IMG_5990.webp"  /></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/events/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/events">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
