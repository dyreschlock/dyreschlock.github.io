| September 30, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Anbousan <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> is another very near by mountain.  It's peak is on the border of Furukawa Town <span class='ja'>古川</span> in Hida City <span class='ja'>飛騨市</span> and Kokufu town <span class='ja'>国府</span> in Takayama City <span class='ja'>高山市</span>.  From the summit, you can see all of downtown Furukawa.  It was another great day on Saturday morning, so I woke up early and took off toward Furukawa.</p><p>There are 3 ways to reach the summit of Anbousan.  Here is the correct way:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913_t.webp"></a></p><p>In Furukawa, between Kita Wakamiya Shrine <span class='ja'>気多若宮神社</span>, and Yoshiki High School <span class='ja'>吉城高校</span>, there's a graveyard.  And behind that graveyard, there's a small parking lot.  Past that parking lot, the road continues into the forest, and connects with the trail entrance.  From here, the sign indicates it will take an hour to ascend the mountain and reach the summit.</p><p>But, I didn't do that.  There are 2 additional ways to reach the summit.  One of which is going through the Taie neighborhood <span class='ja'>太江</span> west of the mountain.</p><p>In the Taie neighborhood, there's a sign pointing toward a farm.  I drove past the sign, through the farm, and reached a gate.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7531.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7531.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7535.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7535.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7535.webp" /></p><p>This gate is not locked.  In fact, the sign says <span class='ja'>ゲートを開けたら心ず閉めて下さい</span>, which means, <i>"If you open the gate, please close the gate."</i>  Entry is not prohibited.  I think it's just meant the keep out bears, and other wildlife.</p><p>As the sign indicates, it's a quick 6 km drive to reach the summit.  Parking is directly next to the summit.  Using this route, there is no climbing at all.  The road is completely paved, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I reached the summit around 7:30 in the morning.  There were perfect clear blue skies when I left my apartment at 6:45, but some clouds began to move in and obstruct the view. :(</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7561_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7561_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7561_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7561_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7561_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7568_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7568_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7568_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7568_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7568_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The clouds started making my photos a bit uneven, and it was a little difficult to get decent captures of Furukawa below.  But, you could totally see all of Furukawa.  You could see the station <span class='ja'>古川駅</span>, the museum, route 41, Furukawa elementary school <span class='ja'>古川小</span>, Furukawa junior high school <span class='ja'>古川中</span>, Yoshiki high school <span class='ja'>吉城高校</span>, too…  everything.</p><p>Unfortunately the trees and hills of the east obstructed views of Kokufu.  But the encroaching clouds looked beautiful and layered.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7619.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7619.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7619_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7619_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7619_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7647_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7647_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7647_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7647_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7647_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was a bit discouraged.  I figured the clouds would eventually clear up, but I didn't want to wait around for an hour or two.  So, I continued toward the other interesting part of the area, Kojima castle ruins <span class='ja'>小島城</span>.</p><p>There was a fork in the road a few kilometers back.  Taking a left brought me to the summit.  Taking a right will bring me to the castle ruins.  I made my way back to the fork, and continued toward the ruins.</p><p>Unfortunately, this road was not as well kept as the road leading to the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cracks and fissures separated parts of the road.  This was probably a nice dirt road before the typhoon and floods and all that.  The running water cut through the weak points of the road, washed away the dirt, and exposed the heavy rock underneath.  It was slow driving, but not impossible.</p><p>It felt like forever, but only after 10 minutes, I made it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7727.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7727_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7743.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7743.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7743_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7743_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7743_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7754.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7754_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7754_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7754_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There really aren't any signs of any previous structures in this area at all.  The only record are the pillars planted in the ground in a few places indicating buildings that once used to be there.</p><p>Prior to Yoritsuna's seizure of the Hida province, and the creation of <a href="/old/v7/mastukura-castle-harayama" title="/mastukura-castle-harayama">Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></a> in the 1500s, in the 1300s, another general of the Anegakoji line seized Hida for his army.  He built Kojima castle <span class='ja'>小島城</span> to defend Hida.  He created a few other defending castles in the area as well.  In fact, throughout time, this whole area had more than a dozen castles and forts.</p><p>I was at the ruins for a little while, and I noticed the sky has really opened up.  All the clouds that darkened the view from before had gone away.  With this opportunity, I hopped in my car, and drove back to the summit.</p><p>And everything was a lot more clear when I returned. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7851_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7851_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7851_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7851_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7851_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7835_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7835_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7835_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7835_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7835_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The town was crystal clear.  There was a group of hikers at the summit when I arrived.  4 men and a woman.  They were taking group hiking photos of their recent accomplishment, and having a good time.  They left not too much longer after I arrived.  They made some comments about how I drove to the summit, rather than hiked.  I dunno.  I guess driving up this mountain was cheating, but whatever.</p><p>I was satisfied.  I exited the road through the original gate, and drove around Furukawa a little bit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7874_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7898.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7898_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7898_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7898_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I drove to the official and correct entrance to look around.  Again, near the entrance is Kita Wakamiya Shrine <span class='ja'>気多若宮神社</span>, one of the more prominent shrines in Furukawa.  Behind this shrine are a series of dams that lead up the mountain.  The trail for Anbousan follows the dams and rivers.  I reached this area about an hour after I left the summit.  I met up with the same group of hikers from the summit, too.</p><p>Anyway, that's Anbousan.  You can drive to the summit, and view all of Furukawa from the peak.  I would love to go here while the sun sets and see what the town looks like.  I might be able to get up here during the winter, too, provided someone plows, or the snow on the road melts.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>7:10am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Taie Gate <span class='ja'>太江ゲート</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361">N36° 15' 16.47", E137° 11' 12.25"</a></td></tr><tr><td>7:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>7:30am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Anbousan Summit <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917">N36° 14' 59.28", E137° 12' 46.05"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:00am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:10am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kojima Castle Ruins <span class='ja'>小島城</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2517861,137.1747528" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2517861,137.1747528">N36° 15' 6.43", E137° 10' 29.11"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:35am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:45am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Anbousan Summit <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917">N36° 14' 59.28", E137° 12' 46.05"</a></td></tr><tr><td>9:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>9:10am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Taie Gate <span class='ja'>太江ゲート</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361">N36° 15' 16.47", E137° 11' 12.25"</a></td></tr><tr><td>9:45am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Anbousan Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> <span class='ja'>登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2436722,137.2059583" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2436722,137.2059583">N36° 14' 37.22", E137° 12' 21.45"</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ontake-yama Eruption 御嶽山噴火" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ontake-eruption">Ontake-yama Eruption 御嶽山噴火</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 29, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Saturday, around noon, the nearby mountain, Mt. Ontake <span class='ja'>御嶽山</span>, erupted spewing ash and debris into the air.  The ash cloud shot into the air and completely covered sky.  Some eye-witness hikers reported that day almost immediately turned to night.  The ash rained down on the upper areas of the mountain, and covered the terrain.  Some area have a layer of ash at least a meter thick.</p><p>It was a beautiful clear early autumn day, so the mountain had plenty of hikers out to conquer the mountain.  Many of those hikers are now stranded at the mountain's summit building.  Others are still missing.  Others have been confirmed dead.</p><p>The eruption was unexpected, so there was no time to warn anyone on the mountain.  The last seismic activity observed from the mountain was in 2007.  And it lay dormant since.</p><p>I have never lived so close to an erupting volcano before.  So, yesterday, I drove out there to take a look for myself.  Additionally, I wanted to collect a jug full of ash.</p><div class='title'><b>Location</b></div><p>Mt. Ontake is the second largest mountain in Japan at 3067 meters above sea level.  It's located on the border between Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span> and Nagano prefecture <span class='ja'>長野県</span>.  In Gifu, Mt. Ontake is in the Hida region.  Part of the mountain is in the Takayama city area <span class='ja'>高山市</span>, in the village of Takane <span class='ja'>高根村</span>, in the Hiwada neighborhood <span class='ja'>日和田</span>.  This is the very south-eastern outskirts of Takayama.  Up until 2008, there used to be a school here.  Hiwada covers less than half the mountain, though.  The rest of the Gifu's claim to Ontake-yama is in Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span>, which is still part of the Hida region.  In Gero, this is Osaka village <span class='ja'>小坂村</span>.</p><p>I don't know much about Nagano prefecture, but on that side of the mountain, within Nagano is Kiso village <span class='ja'>木曽村</span>.</p><p>From downtown Takayama, it took about an hour to drive to Hiwada.  And from the remnants of Hiwada's old elementary school ground, I could clearly see Ontake-yama.  This is north, north-east of the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The steam and exhaust from the eruption continued to escape into the sky.  Looking even closer, several helicopters circled the erupted peak.  They were still searching for survivors, and possibly evacuating the survivors remaining at the summit.</p><p>So, I wondered how close I could get to this disaster, and if I was able to collect my jug of ash.</p><p>From Hiwada, I continued driving and entered Nagano prefecture in Kiso village.  This beautiful scenic route offered plenty of opportunities to stop along the road, and take some photos of the beautiful, yet currently dangerous mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The turnoff for the Ontake gondolas was in a small farming area of Kiso village.  This was almost directly north-east of the mountain.  From here, you could begin to see the extent of just how much ash covered the mountain.  The north side of the mountain was relatively ash-free.  The south-side was almost totally covered.</p><p>At this point, I was about 7 kilometers away from the eruption.  In this farming area, there were no signs of ash on the ground.  Everything looked pretty normal.</p><p>I continued south towards the gondola entrance.  The roads became a little bit more gray, and I began to realize there was a thin layer of ash almost everywhere.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8009.webp" /></p><p>Most of it has been cleaned up by the street sweepers, though.  Some fire trucks and emergency vehicles drove by as I took photos on the side of the road.</p><p>Traveling just a little bit further, I came to the gondola entrance, which was blocked by emergency vehicles.  There were many other gawkers there as well.  Their cameras lined the shoulder of the road, snapping photos of the peak.  This was directly east of the peak.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8020.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8020.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8020.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016a.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016a.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016a.webp" /></p><p>From here, I had a full view of the eruption.  Additionally, looking further, I could clearly see the summit building.  It was almost totally buried in ash.  Helicopters continued to search overhead looking for survivors.  I did not notice if the helicopters were actually evacuating people, though.</p><p>I wanted to get slightly closer, so I could collect some ash.  The emergency vehicles prevented people from gaining access.  I looked on the map for alternatives.  Down the road a bit further was a farm that had an access road to the gondolas.  I drove there, but it was blocked by fire trucks.  D'oh.  I drove back north, and went down another side road.  Again blocked.</p><p>But, in this side road area were many plants that had collected some ash on their leaves.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was able to grab these plants and brush off the ash <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8044.webp">into my jug</a>.  From this, I was able to collect about <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8046.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8046.webp">100 grams of ash</a>.  Not a lot, but it's better than nothing.  I collected ash for about 20 minutes, then decided to continue.</p><p>There were a few more turnoffs that lead to the mountain, so I drove down these roads to see what was there.  The next area I went to was some kind of cabin camping area for rich people named <span class='ja'>やまゆり荘</span>.  Within this neighborhood was a miniature golf course, a swimming pool, and some tennis courts.  This was about 5 or 6 kilometers from the eruption.</p><p>And these tennis court were the perfect receptacle for collecting volcanic ash.  There were a large wide open space, presently untouched by nature or man.  The ash from the eruption had not been cleaned or blown away.</p><p>Nearby were broom to clean the court.  I grabbed one, and swept up a bunch of ash into a pile.  Then, I put it all into my jug.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8055.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8061.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8061.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8061.webp" /></p><p>Success!  A jug of volcanic ash.  Nearby was a sink and running water, so I was able to clean my hands.</p><p>I continued driving around the neighborhood, looking for a trail entrance, or some other way of getting closer to the mountain.  It's somewhat hard to see, but this whole area had a light layer of ash covering everything.  The street sweepers did not yet have a chance to clean the roads.  As I drove down these roads, my car kicked up some clouds of ash, which made my car a bit dirty, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8082.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8082.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8082.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8088.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8088.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8088.webp" /></p><p>I wrapped around the neighborhood, and came across a trail entrance.  Every road leading to the mountain had signs like the one above.</p><p><span class='ja'>御嶽山噴火により</span> - Due to the eruption of Mt. Ontake.<br/><span class='ja'>入山禁止</span> - Entrance is prohibited.</p><p>Eh, I drove up this road anyways to see what was there.  When I reached the trail entrance, there were police waiting.  A single cop car was perched on the road making sure no one continued along.  The two policemen approached my car, and told me that entrance was prohibited, and I should leave.  So, I turned around and went back.</p><p>The emergency teams of Kiso village were pretty thorough.  If even this tiny little entrance had a patrol, I was most likely not going to find anyway else to gain access to the mountain.  And really, I already got my jug of ash, and enough photos.  I didn't need to proceed any further.</p><p>I went back to the farms, then took to the road returning to Hiwada.  It was around 1pm now.  With the afternoon sun directly above, the air became a bit hazy, and more difficult to get decent shots.</p><p>The mountain continued to erupt.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I arrived in Hiwada, and decided to go to the Ciao ski resort to take a look of the mountain from that side.  Given the direction of the wind in the Kita Alps, Gifu is most untouched from the eruption.  The wind has blown all the ash and debris into Nagano.</p><p>The Ciao ski resort is directly north of the mountain peaks.  The actual eruption was slightly obscured by the northern peak of Ontake-yama.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8149.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8149.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8149_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8149_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8149_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8150.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8150_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8150_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8150_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At Ciao, there were plenty of people taking photos.  There were no police or emergency vehicles.  It felt like this whole eruption, despite being on joint Gifu and Nagano land, was really only being handled by Nagano.  I guess that makes sense, though, since that's the direction of the fallout.</p><p>I went up to the resort a little bit and looked around.  I noticed some hikers returning from the hills.  I think they were there for the same reason I was.</p><div class='title'><b>Safety</b></div><p>Anyway, Takayama is totally safe from the eruption of Ontake.  Even Hiwada, the closest area of Takayama, seemed unaffected by the blast, and fallout.  Hiwada didn't even have any ash.  They probably didn't even feel anything.</p><p>Kiso village in Nagano seemed hit the most by the disaster, as well as the visiting hikers, some of whom lost their lives.  I think at this point, there are still 30 hikers missing, most likely buried in ash somewhere near the peak of the mountain.  I hope rescue workers are able to recover them before they die. :(<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Akigami Elementary 秋神小学校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/akigami-elementary-school">Akigami Elementary 秋神小学校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And as the sun set, the sky continued to stay completely clear, void of clouds.  As Summer continues to wane, and Fall becomes the official season, I think there will be more and more days like this.</p><p>This was the first night in a very long time without any cloud cover.  There was no moon, either.  It was 11pm, so I decided to look up how to take night images with my camera, and then I tested it from my apartment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Holy crap, this actually worked.  A little bit, anyway.  There was a spot on my lens.  Plus, I needed to cut out almost all the darkness from the levels, and crank the brightness a little bit.  But, I could see quite a bit of stars. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Into the Dark</b></div><p>Obviously the best places to take starry photos are from really really dark places.  Living in the mountains is perfect for this opportunity because there is very little light pollution.  Takayama is small, but it's still the biggest city around here, and gives off some light pollution.  I wanted to test my camera a little further.  So, I hopped in my car, and drove to <b>Nyuukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span></b>.</p><p>Nyuukawa Village probably has about 4000 people.  It's mostly mountains and forested wilderness, but the area nearest Takayama has some wide open farmland.  I drove west from central Nyuukawa until I came across what looked like an open space.  I think I actually parked in some guy's driveway.</p><p>I could see everything.  I could see the Milky Way galaxy, and the millions and millions of stars throughout the entire night sky.  It was..  huge.  Sure, it was faint.  But being engulfed in most darkness allows the eyes to adjust.  </p><p>I laid down on the ground, and looked up at the starry sky.  A bizarre feeling of dizziness came over me.  Like I was going to fall over, but I was already lying down.  I guess that's vertigo, right?  The vastness of space was laid out before me.  The near infinite landscape of the cosmos.  I saw a shooting star, too!</p><p>Anyway, I set up my camera, and took some photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They turned out way more clear than the ones I took from my apartment.  Unfortunately, the scene was simply to vast, and my camera is not sensitive enough to capture everything.</p><p>It was able to capture some interesting things, though.  If you look closely at those photos, the star are actually colored either red or blue!  It's pretty amazing that my camera is able to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification">the temperature</a> of the stars. </p><p>About 20 minutes into my time taking photos, an airplane passed by overhead, so I tried to taking photos of that.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7487.webp" /></p><p>All in all, I spent about 45 minutes in this guy's driveway taking photos of the night sky, and the surrounding area.

| September 20, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Takayama City <span class='ja'>高山市</span> is known in Japan as a city that has kept its Edo period roots.  The old streets and sake breweries in the heart of the city, and being completely surrounded by mountains and nature convey these old feelings.  There really isn't another place like it.</p><p>Before it was created in this image, Takayama was the site of a few battles.  In the 1500s, some dude named Yoritsuna seized the Hida province and built the Matsukura castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span> to defend it.  Some decades later, Kanamori <span class='ja'>金森</span> was ordered to attack Yoritsuna and capture Hida, who then ruled the Echizen Ono Castle <span class='ja'>越前大野城</span>, which you might remember as the 3rd castle on my <a href="/old/v7/20-castle-stamp-rally" title="/20-castle-stamp-rally">20 Castle Stamp Rally Card</a>.  </p><p>Kanamori battled and defeated Yoritsuna in 1585, and became the ruler of Hida.  Matsukura Castle was a warrior's castle, though.  It was built for battling and defending, but this is not what Kanamori and his clan wanted for Takayama.  In 1588, Kanamori began construction of the Takayama Castle <span class='ja'>高山城</span>, and basically created Takayama in the image of a castle town.  He's basically the founder of modern day Takayama, and you can find all kinds of info and artifacts about Kanamori in the Takayama Museum of History and Art.  After his capture of Takayama, it basically became a peaceful place.</p><p>Matsukura Castle was abandoned, and eventually destroyed somehow.  The rules of this castle (and the Takayama Castle) are still present today.  Though, the Takayama Castle ruins aren't nearly as interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>The site of the Matsukura Castle is located near current Matsukura Junior High School <span class='ja'>松倉中</span>, on the southwest corner of the heart of Takayama City.  This time I actually went hiking with a friend. :)  After lunch, we began around 2pm.</p><p>To get to the ruins, drive up the hill past Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨の里</span>, and you'll find a plateau where you can park.  From there, you will find a path that leads up into the forest.  It takes about 10 minutes if you're driving from Takayama Station.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" /></p><p>The path is only 250 meters, and it takes about 5 or 10 minutes to hike through the slightly rocky terrain.  Being in such close proximity to the city allows the trails to be easily well kept, and well traveled..  There were really no traces of any large animals along the trail, either.  But there were plenty of mushrooms.</p><p>Heavier rocks are embedded in the trail as we continued, and then came across a partially collapsed edge of a castle wall.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" /></p><p>The trails leads past the wall, and around the main wall of the castle ruins.  There were trees and grass, but the area was still very rocky.

Just a few quick steps to climb, and we had a much more wide open view of lower Takayama, and the Enako neighborhood <span class='ja'>江名子町</span>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the above photo..  On the bottom of the photo is lower Takayama, where Hie Junior High School <span class='ja'>日枝中</span> and Sanno Elementary School <span class='ja'>三王小</span> are prominent and clearly visible.  The area above that is the Enako neighborhood <span class='ja'>江名子町</span>, which has Enako Elementary <span class='ja'>江名子小</span>.  That school is probably visible in there somewhere.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are plenty of trees on this mountain which obstructed the full view of Takayama City.  It was still possible to see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6689.webp">Nakayama Junior High School <span class='ja'>中山中</span></a>, and the Mieda area in the north.  Further west, you could see some of the Shingu area, but it was almost all obstructed by trees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" /></p><p>It would really help if this summit had a platform that went up another 10 meters.  You could see over the trees, and completely view Takayama.  Maybe they can't build one, though.  I think this site is protected under some historical preservation law.</p><p>Overall, the castle ruins were interesting, but having the view obstructed kinda blows the full experience of the castle.  My friend was reminded a haiku poem that mentions the history one can feel in such a place.  More than 400 years ago, hundreds of warriors and soldiers lost their lives in battle defending this castle, and their souls linger and shape the life growing on this mountain.</p><div class='title'><b>Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span></b></div><p>The Matsukura Castle ruins was only the first thing on my list of things to do in this area.  We went back to the parking area, got some water, and took a look at the area map.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" /></p><p>Our next destination was the summit of Harayama, or Mt. Hara, which was only another kilometer away by hiking.  The whole area was a loop, but we already did most of the heavy climbing in my car.</p><p>We continued into the forest going the opposite direction of Matsukura Castle to reach the summit, and the trail was quite a bit more rough.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" /></p><p>Some areas were covered with some heavy rocks erupting from the ground.  Other areas slightly covered with foliage.  At some point, there was even a climbing rope provided to help us walk up a 40/45 degree incline.  The map indicated this was a walking path, but as my friend continued to mention, this wasn't really walking at all.  It was hiking.</p><p>I took some pictures, but we continued to press on.  We were supposed to come across some kind of house marked on the map, but we didn't see anything.  After traveling a full kilometer we reached a fork in the road and a sign that said we reached the walking path we thought we were on.  Apparently we took some kind of rough shortcut.  Bleh, whatever.</p><p>100 meters ahead was the summit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From here you could clearly see the entire Shingu neighborhood <span class='ja'>新宮町</span>, downtown Takayama, a little bit of Nyukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span>, and off in the west you could see one of the prominent neighborhoods in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6753.webp">Kiyomi <span class='ja'>清見</span></a>.</p><p>You could clearly see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6754.webp">Shingu Elementary <span class='ja'>新宮小</span></a>, which was in the middle of their Sports Festival. :D  We could even hear the announcements from the summit, too.  We were probably only 2 kilometers away at most.</p><p>The view was gorgeous considering the heavy clouds from the morning.  This has been a running theme in the current weather of Takayama.  It gets really cold at night, which brings in all these clouds, and fog.  In the morning, it's overcast, and gloomy.  Throughout the morning, it's still overcast, but the clouds begin to break apart with the increasing temperature.  Eventually the sky opens up in mid-day.  Then gets covered up again as the sun sets.</p><p>The tallest looking mountain in the whole view was <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6785.webp">Ibuseyama <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span></a>, which I visited a few weeks ago: <a href="/old/v7/ibuseyama" title="/ibuseyama">September 3rd</a>.</p><p>We took in the view for a while, then made our way back to the car.  We took the correct suggested route on the way back, though, which was excellent for some variety.</p><div class='title'><b>Kanodoko-iwa <span class='ja'>かなどこ岩</span></b></div><p>The first thing we came across was a big rock label Kanodoko-iwa.

Despite being the correct "walking trail", the terrain is still rather rough and rocky.  I brought up Skyrim as a conversation topic because I always think about that game when hiking through all these wooded areas.

Also inside is a large space for anyone to meet and hang out.</p><p>We continue to the front of the temple, and there's a another structure, a stage.

Every year on August 9th and 10th, a festival is held to pray and celebrate good health and a good upcoming harvest as fall approached.  Over those two days, members of the temple create those infamous Hida horse paintings for the townspeople and anyone willing to make the hike to their temple.  The artists work nonstop from the 9th to the 10th creating these painting and celebrating good fortune.

Parts of the walkway are even cobbled.  It's a smooth 800 meter walk back to the car at this point.

| September 11, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span> when taking a dan <span class='ja'>段</span> level examination for kendo <span class='ja'>剣道</span>, one of the components is a written test.  The Gifu Kendo Federation provides a book which details all the questions and answers they use for this test.  </p><p>I will take the test in November, and unfortunately for me, it's all in Japanese.  So, I translated the book into English, and then made a few edits with a kendo dictionary after.</p><p><i>Currently</i>, this is a work in progress.  I've completely translated the first 3 parts.  But for the 4th part of the book, I only translated the shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span> level questions for now.  I'll do the rest after November.</p><p>You can download my translation and take a look for yourselves, at the following link:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs/ <span class='ja'>剣道学科審査問題集</span> Kendo Exam Question Workbook - WOP-2014-09-11.pdf</a></p><p>It's a PDF.  Also, the size of the paper is a Japanese B4 size, which is 257 mm (10.12 in) by 364 mm (14.33 in), and it's currently 18 pages.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6373.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6375.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6375.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>Kendo is one of the oldest forms of martial arts in Japan.  It literally translates as "way of the sword," and across Japan tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of elementary, junior high, high school, college students, and regular citizens practice or have practiced Kendo at some point in their life.</p><p>I began practicing Kendo in April 2013 when the junior high school I taught at continued to ask me to join them in their practices.  It's been great exercise, great stress relief, and I've met so many people throughout the community through this sport.</p><p>Much like every martial art, Kendo has an idea of ranking, similar to the black belt system in Karate.  Kendo has two levels of mastery, Kyuu <span class='ja'>級</span>, and Dan <span class='ja'>段</span>.  To achieve these ranks, you must take an exam.  And in Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>, these exams are proctored by the Gifu-ken Kendo Association.  They visit the Takayama area 4 times a year.</p><p>The first level, kyuu <span class='ja'>級</span>, builds up from higher number to lower.  So, 1-kyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span> is the highest rank on the kyuu scale.  From there, the next level is dan <span class='ja'>段</span>, in which numbers increase.</p><div class='title'><b>Not Ranked</b></div><p>You gotta start somewhere.  If you're a junior high school student, or older, when taking the test for the first time, the requirements are similar to the 1-kyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span> test.  Afterward, the judges will assign a grade to you.</p><p>I took the unranked exam in November last year.  My exam had two parts.  I had to perform all 9 waza for kihon-waza with a bukkuto.  Then needed to perform a series of moves attacking an opponent.</p><p>Kihon-waza are a series of movements in kendo that are practiced slowly and methodically.  This series are some of the most basic moves you can perform within a kendo match.  Performing them in this way teaches correct posture, body movement, foot movement, and shinai movement.</p><p>Here's a youtube clip of the waza being performed:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ</a></p><p>Additionally, you must perform some moves in realtime against an opponent.  For unranked, I had to perform kiri-kaeshi, men-no-uchi, kote-men-no-uchi, men-kaeshi-dou, and men-suriage-men.</p><p>I messed up the men-suriage-men.  They blamed it on my opponent, though, and let me try again.  Again, I messed it up, so they realized it was my fault not his.</p><p>But overall, I was awarded 2-kyuu <span class='ja'>二級</span>!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" /></p><p>This put me on the same level as the 5th grade elementary students I practiced with each week.  Actually, many of my students were taking the exam as well, and got 2-kyuu, too!</p><div class='title'><b>1-Kyuu Exam <span class='ja'>一級</span></b></div><p>In June this year, I took the 1-kyuu exam.  This test had 3 parts.  It had the same 2 parts from the unranked tests: the kihon-waza, and the series of real-time moves.  In addition, I also had to take part in an example shiai, or match.</p><p>Within the match, I had to demonstrate how I attack and strike my opponent, and show as much variety as possible.  I didn't need to win, or get as many valid strikes as possible.  I just need to demonstrate I knew how to initiate attacks, reacts to incoming attacks, and that all my movements were in sync.</p><p>I think I was a little stiff in some actions, but my mind was 100% centered on the moves I was performing, and what was happening within the match.  I tuned out everything around me, and forgot about the world.  It was only my opponent and myself that existed.  It may have been the first time I actually felt this way.  Usually, I'm very conscious of instruction, and how I look performing these moves, but I couldn't focus on that.  I pushed it all out of my mind.  </p><p>I did all this MAINLY because I was the last person to do this test.  They put me in the back because I was so tall and couldn't "measure" to the other test takers.  So, no one else was in line behind me.  Everyone else had already finished.  I was the only one on the floor, and all the other participants, families, judges, and whomever else were all watching me.  Maybe 200 people?</p><p>I do get a little stage fright in front of so many people, but this is compounded.  Everyone is Japanese.  I'm the only white guy here.  I stand out quite a bit (literally).  And I'm the only white guy, in the history of Takayama (possibly in all Gifu), to do Kendo and take these tests.

| September 7, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today was a beautiful September day in Takayama.  There was a little rain over night, but the weather completely cleared up, and today had completely blue skies all day.  Throughout the summer, there have been many rainy days.  Nice weather like this only happens for a few hours at a time.  Not for an entire day.</p><p>The staff at one of my school's recommended that I hike a nearby mountain named <b>Juunigatake</b> <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span> located in the village of Nyukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span> which is within the borders of Takayama City.  Juunigatake literally translates as Mt. 12.</p><p>After a little Internet searching, I found out how to get there, and took off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" /></p><p>Google Maps had brought me to a small pocket of farms in the Gonbo <span class='ja'>根肩</span> neighborhood of Nyukawa at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a>.  Between a few fields of rice was a road that led up into the mountains.  At the entrance to the road was a temple, and several signs that warned about forest fires.  Also, near the entrance were some sandbags left over from the flash flooding that occurred a few weeks ago.</p><p>I started to climb the trail with my car, but the road was incredibly damaged by the flood.  Narrow mountain roads make excellent canals for running flood water.  I'm sure that was a decent dirt trail before, but all the loose dirt had been washed away leaving rocks, and some remaining mud.  Some storm drains had been <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp">knocked out</a> of their positions, so <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp">I fixed it</a>, and continued.</p><p>In my mind, I kept thinking that I should turn around.  One of my car tires will get stuck, or my car will bottom-out, or one of these rocks will puncture my tire.  This is actually dangerous.  Sense and reason finally prevailed.  I turned my car around, exited the trail, parked, and began walking up the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" /></p><p>My car did not make it very far, and it was very sobering to continue this trail on foot and see just how doomed this journey would have been.  One stretch of road was half-collapsed with a fissure splitting it in two.  Nearby rock slides had washed out part of the road, too.  It was totally impassable by car.</p><p>After almost a kilometer hike up the steep trail, the forest began to open up, and grass had began to creep into the trail.  The blue sky was overhead, and I came across a couple of buildings.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" /></p><p>The road forked to the left which had two old homes.  There are here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222">N36° 10' 49.89", E137° 22' 29.72"</a>.  Abandoned, and left to rot.  The doors were locked tight, and the windows were boarded.  One of homes had some old tools underneath part of the roof, but nothing seemed like it had any normal use.  I did not pry.</p><p>A few more meters down this road led to the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp">back of someone's farm</a>.  There were some vegetable fields, and plenty of rice fields too.  I could see the owner near his house, too.  He was trimming weeds near his home.  I guess he must own these rundown homes.  Or at least, perhaps, he's the current property owner.</p><p>What I found VERY curious was I could clear see modern vehicles parked at his house.  One of which was another small kei car like mine.  How the hell did he get those up here?</p><p>Well, after going back to the fork in the road, and continuing, I came across pavement.  Apparently this washed up, damaged road was not the correct way to get to my mountain, and I'm an idiot.  I reexamined my map, then went back to my car to meet this road on the other side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" /></p><p>Hey, look at that.  After driving the correct way into the mountain, there's an actual sign and a map detailing where I'm supposed to go.  This looks like the right place.  <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556">N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately the pavement did not last long.  But the road was not washed out or damaged by the flood, so my car could continue.  The view was mostly obscured by brush, but it was an easy drive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" /></p><p>I came to the first fork in the road at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444">N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"</a>, and the main sign for the trail had been split from its posts by the wind.  I doubled checked the map to make sure I was going the right way.  I had been, so I continued.</p><p>Now, the road had been getting a little more difficult.  Some rocks had fallen in the roads.  I stopped a few times to clear some of the larger ones out of the way to make sure my car wouldn't be damaged.</p><p>There were many times when the surrounding grass had grown so wildly, it completely engulfed my car as I passed through it.  As some points, it began growing in the middle of the road as well.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5851.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5851.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5851.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5875_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5875_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5875_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5875_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5875_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At one point, the side of the road opened up, and I got a glimpse of what the view would be from the summit.</p><p>The road continued through some overgrown grassy areas.  I double checked the map, and found the next way point, which was no longer marked by a sign.  I parked my car, and had to continue the trail on foot.  I was here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889">N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"</a>.</p><p>And the climb was steep.

The gates were open, but I didn't pry all that much.  It was Sunday, so there wasn't anyone working.  There were pigs, chickens, and other animals.  Plus several enclosed fields for vegetables.  I simply bought a drink from the vending machine and left.</p><p>I continued to the structure most visible in the north, the Nyukawa Dam, at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2178361,137.37015" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2178361,137.37015">N36° 13' 4.21", E137° 22' 12.54"</a>.

Another beautiful mountain in the Hida Takayama area.  Not that difficult to get to, and not that difficult to climb.

Cars are more powerful.  Roads are better made.  And in some cases, ropeways have been built to bring people to the top.  But I'm sure there are still some hiking teams that travel around and climb more difficult mountains.  I'll work my way up there eventually.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline - First Attempt</b></div><table><tr><td>10:20am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Nyuukawa Gonbo <span class='ja'>丹生川根方</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:35am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Farm Houses</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222">N36° 10' 49.89", E137° 22' 29.72"</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:55am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to my Car <span class='ja'>車に帰り</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a></td></tr></table><div class='title'><b>Timeline - Second Attempt</b></div><table><tr><td>11:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Juunigatake Entrance <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳入口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556">N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Juunigatake Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444">N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:35am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>歩き登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889">N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:45am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Fork, and Tori Gate <span class='ja'>鳥居</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778">N36° 11' 47.22", E137° 23' 5.56"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:50am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Summit <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722">N36° 11' 49.74", E137° 23' 11.66"</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Eastern Summit <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span> <span class='ja'>東峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111">N36° 11' 48.31", E137° 23' 16.48"</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:25pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Outhouse</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12:30pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Water Well</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12:45pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>歩き登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889">N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:05pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Juunigatake Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444">N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:25pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Nyuukawa Dam <span class='ja'>丹生川ダム</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2178361,137.37015" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2178361,137.37015">N36° 13' 4.21", E137° 22' 12.54"</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ibuseyama 猪臥山" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ibuseyama">Ibuseyama 猪臥山</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 3, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On the border between Takayama City, and Hida City, between Kiyomi Village and Furukawa Town, there lies a mountain named Ibuseyama <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span>.  The website said it was famous, but when I mentioned it to a few local teachers, none of them had heard of it.  The peak of Ibuseyama is about an hours drive from Furukawa, so I decided to take a look.</p><p>Out of Furukawa, there's a road named Hwy 90, and it acts as a shortcut for people in western Hida City to reach the tollway entrance in Kiyomi, named the Hida Kiyomi IC <span class='ja'>飛騨清見</span>IC.  The road starts off rather large and straight, but there are pockets of houses that do not allow the road to continue this way.  The road windily climbs up the side of a mountain and through a forest.  At its peak, the road levels off, widens, and continues straight once again.  After the road widens, it goes through a near 4.5km long tunnel, and then you're nearly at the tollway entrance.</p><p>To get to Ibuseyama, you need to turn into a neighborhood right before this tunnel.  This one: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111">N36° 13' 14.45", E137° 9' 0.4"</a>.  In fact, this very turn can be seen from the peak of Ibuseyama.  The road becomes very narrow, and the forest becomes thicker, and more debris is scattered on the road since very few people actually go this way.</p><p>After 20 minutes from Furukawa, you reach a very remote area of Kiyomi Village <span class='ja'>清見村</span>, the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'>小鳥町</span>.  Here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222">N36° 12' 22.42", E137° 6' 19.88"</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" /></p><p>There's a crossroads here.  I stopped my car, and got out to take this photo.  After standing, there was absolutely no sound.  No running water.  No wind.  No animals.  Nothing.  It was dead silent.  Once crossed into this remote area of Kiyomi, it was like I entered a dead zone.  Maybe it was haunted.</p><p>Anyway, at this crossroads, I had two choices. Make a left and continue to the mountain, or continue straight through the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'>小鳥町</span> of Kiyomi. I went left.</p><p>The road is paved, which is nice, but much of the pavement is cracked and bulging from the movement of rock underneath, erosion by water and melted snow on the top, or landslides that had previously taken out part of the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My little car continued to climb.  I went past several hairpin turns exceeding 180 degrees.  There were several drop offs with no guardrails.  And lots of loose rock covering the roads making it sometimes difficult for my car to get a foothold.  </p><p>With every passing turn, the height of the forest became a little shorter, and more sky started shinning through.  There were more dramatic plateaus, and more dramatic views of the distance I've traveled.</p><p>I stopped a few times to take photos, but after 30 minutes, I reached the end of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444">N36° 11' 27.9", E137° 6' 48.04"</a>. I made it, and parked my car.  Nearby was a bathroom that was not regularly serviced.

The whole area seemed so big, and human civilization seemed so small.  So much of Japan is over crowded, but up in the mountains, there's barely anyone.  The mountainous forested wilderness still holds its ground.</p><p>I stayed up here for probably 30 minutes.  The slight dimming of the sky made me worried about having to travel through the difficult mountain road in the dark.</p><p>As I left the peak, some of the clouds on Norikura-dake <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> began to fade away.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" /></p><p>Also, as I left, I could hear the 5pm curfew chime ringing in Furukawa from all the way up here.</p><p>I got in my car and continued down the mountain road back to the crossroads.

It was named the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span>.  In closed in 1968 after its remaining 2 students graduated or moved or whatever.  Even in 1955, it only had 8 students.  I think <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4955.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4955.webp">this</a> was the site of the old school.</p><p>These days the neighborhood only has one household from what I could tell.  That was the farmhouse you could see from the peak.  This house owned the nearby grazing fields, and several farming fields, too.</p><p>Once I passed a few more fields on the west end of the farming area, the road went into the forest, which was getting darker with the setting sun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" /></p><p>The road was narrow, and winded through the forest following the stream of water trickling down the mountain.  It wasn't very steep, though.  There were several turn-offs from the main road, but were immediately blocked by a gate preventing public access.  I was really afraid that this main road would eventually have the same fate, and force me to turn around.</p><p>The river continued to grow the further down the mountain I went.  What once was a tiny stream, now became a babbling broke, and then a creek.  The road was in better and better condition, too, the further I went, which gave me hope I was approaching the exit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" /></p><p>After one more turn around the side of a mountain, the road widened and straightened.  I was able to drive nearly 60mph again, rather than the careful cautious 10mph or 15mph I had been driving up until now.</p><p>I passed huge quarries, and construction workers tearing up part of the mountain.</p><p>Then I finally reached the exit at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.198875,137.0415361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.198875,137.0415361">N36° 11' 55.95", E137° 2' 29.53"</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5022.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5022.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5022.webp" /></p><p>I was back on the main road in the Ikemoto neighborhood <span class='ja'>池本町</span> of Kiyomi.  I had traveled nearly 45 minutes to get to this point from the peak, and now there's only another 10 minutes to get to the highway, and being able to speed back to Takayama.  The exit for this area was near the Ikemoto elementary site, and Kiyomi's zakura tree, directly underneath a bridge for the tollway.</p><p>I drove to the highway entrance, and stopped on the suspended on-ramp to take a photo of where I was only one hour ago, the peak of Ibuseyama, which is somewhat muddled in the amount of mountains.  It's near that cellphone tower on the left side of the photo.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is just one of many mountains in the Hida Takayama area, and perhaps the easiest and cheapest one to climb.  I have a list and maps of 12 other hiking trails to the peaks of mountains in Hida city.  </p><p>Now isn't the best time to climb due to the rain, and cloud cover, but as it gets colder, and fall approaches, the skies will become clear, and the scenery will look even more beautiful.  Hopefully I have time, and the weather cooperates to allow me to continue viewing Hida Takayama from the sky. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>3:35pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Hwy 41 / Hwy 90 Junction</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3:45pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Hwy 90 Turn off</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111">N36° 13' 14.45", E137° 9' 0.4"</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:10pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kiyomi Village - Odori Pass <span class='ja'>清見村</span> <span class='ja'>小鳥峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222">N36° 12' 22.42", E137° 6' 19.88"</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:30pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Ibuse-yama Parking <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span> P</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444">N36° 11' 27.9", E137° 6' 48.04"</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:40pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Ibuse-yama Summit <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1898667,137.1127417" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1898667,137.1127417">N36° 11' 23.52", E137° 6' 45.87"</a></td></tr><tr><td>5:00pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Ibuse-yama Parking <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span> P</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444">N36° 11' 27.9", E137° 6' 48.04"</a></td></tr><tr><td>5:20pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kiyomi Village - Odori Pass <span class='ja'>清見村</span> <span class='ja'>小鳥峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222">N36° 12' 22.42", E137° 6' 19.88"</a></td></tr><tr><td>6:00pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Hwy 478 Junction</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.198875,137.0415361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.198875,137.0415361">N36° 11' 55.95", E137° 2' 29.53"</a></td></tr><tr><td>6:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kiyomi IC</td><td></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka Railway 神岡鉄道" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-railway">Kamioka Railway 神岡鉄道</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It stretches over a very wide area, but it's downtown area, is its most prominent feature.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At its height, the entire area of Kamioka housed 30,000 residents.  That was a mere 15 years ago.  Most of its residents worked in the mining facilities throughout the land.  But in 2003, the mines was shut, closed, and were no longer in service.  The workers were fired, or relocated, or whatever..  They left Kamioka for greener pastures.  It's most recent census, in 2004, puts the population of Kamioka at around 10,000.</p><p>When I first visited Kamioka over a year ago, the first thing I noticed was the rail line suspended over part of the town, and going through some of the mountains in town.  It looked rundown, and, upon closer inspection, was no longer in service, and mostly abandoned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Railway History</b></div><p>According to <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A">Wikipedia</a>, if I'm reading this right..  The current Kamioka Railway was officially opened in 1966, and exclusively shipped freight from the zinc mines in Kamioka.</p><p>In 1984, the mines adopted the world-wide standard for shipping containers, and had to ship freight by truck.  They still used the lines for shipping other things, but to make up for the costs, the railway was now open to the public.  However, every year operated in a hefty loss.</p><p>After 2003, with the loss of the mines, there were significant shortages of freight and passengers.  In 2004, what was left of the mines ceased its freight transports, and then completely cut its use of the railway.  That hefty loss turned into a massive, unjustifiable loss.</p><p>The railway completely ceased operations on December 1st, 2006.  And the bus system made up for the lack of public transportation.</p><p>In 2008, rather than demolish the railway, the city of Kamioka opened the <b>Kamioka Gattan Go!</b> service, which allowed anyone to rent a bicycle contraption, and ride along the last 3km in the rail line within Kamioka proper.  A few months ago, some ALTs and I went for a ride.

I met some local workers on their way to that train who must've only been working for half a day.</p><p>Across the street from the station was a very small omiyage shop.  It just looked like a corner store.  The old woman who ran the shop was by the station chatting with a taxi driver who looked equally bored.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>Technically, this is the beginning of the Kamioka Railway, but it's the end of my journey.  The Railway had interested me in quite a while, so it was great to finally see the 19.9km stretch of rail from beginning to end.  There's still some more research I could do, but I think Japanese Wikipedia has much of it covered.  I'm still curious on how frequent the trains ran, the price of the fare.</p><p>Wikipedia mentioned that the Kamioka Railway may have only run 8 times a day.  Which is interesting, because the Takayama Line out of Inotani Station seemed to run just as frequent.  I wonder how much longer the Takayama Line will be cost effective, or if it even is cost effective at the moment.  The bus system covers much more ground at a cheaper price.  And the northern central shinkansen line just completed construction all the way to Kanazawa.  When that line goes all the way to Kyoto and Shin-Osaka, the Takayama line will become even less traveled.</p><p>I always considered Japan a marvel at public transportation, but with the areas in the mountains so wide and remote, it's just not feasible.  If you live out here, you basically need a car.</p><p>Anywyay, urban decay, yeah!<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
