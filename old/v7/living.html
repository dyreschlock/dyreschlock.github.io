| February 28, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 10 years ago, I moved to Japan. I didn’t necessarily intend to stay for more than a year or two, but I loved living here and loved teaching students. Teaching had become the most rewarding job I’ve done in my life, so I didn’t want to leave, and it never felt like my time in Japan was complete. Now, this is where I live. A town full of students or parents of students that I’ve helped teach for more than 10 years. And full of friends and connections that I’ve made over the years.</p><p>Now that 10 years has passed, I can apply for Permanent Residence in Japan. In simple terms, Permanent Residence means that I no longer have to renew a work VISA after 3 years and I can buy or build a house. But to me, it means that I’m further established as a part of Japan and don’t intend to leave. It’s the near-equivalent to a Green Card in the US.</p><p>Applying for Permanent Residence is not a simple process of filling out a couple of forms. There are many parts to prove your legal employment, payment of taxes, and contribution to Japan. I spent about a month working on the application back in October, only to have it rejected because I hadn’t lived here a complete 10 years yet. Now, 4 months later, my application is complete and it ended up being 47 pages long.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp"></a></p><p>It was so long that I wrote a Table of Contents describing everything that I included, and sectioned everything into different folders to make it as easy as possible for them to see what I’ve included.</p><p>Here are the table of contents.</p><p>0.      <b>Payment of Fee</b><br/>1.      <b>Application for Permanent Residence</b><br/>2.      <b>Photo</b><br/>3.      <b>Statement of Reason</b><br/>4.      <b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b><br/>5.      <b>Proof of Residence</b><br/>6.      <b>Proof of Employment</b><br/>7.      <b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b><br/>8.      <b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b><br/>9.      <b>Proof of Financial Assets</b><br/>10.    <b>Passport Photo</b><br/>11.    <b>Residence Card Photo</b><br/>12.    <b>Guarantor Information and References</b><br/>13.    <b>Proof of Contributions to Japan</b><br/>14.    <b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b><br/>15.    <b>Application Oath</b></p><p>The instructions for how to apply for permanent residence can be found on the government Immigration website. They are written in <a href="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">English</a> and in <a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">Japanese</a>. My table of contents follows the list of required materials from that page.</p><p>Even though, they have an English version that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to figure out what to do. These instructions are machine translated, and you still need to understand what they’re saying in Japanese because of the specific names for forms, and the specific departments and locations you need to visit. There’s a lot of running around involved getting all the correct documents, so I have detailed everything I did to build my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Payment of Fee</b></div><p>0.      <span class='ja'>手数料</span><br/>This is not required when you submit your application, but it will be required after your application is successful. You must fill out the Payment form and attach an 8000<span class='ja'>円</span> revenue stamp to it. Revenue stamps can be purchased from the post office. Obviously, if you’ve been in Japan long enough, you already know how to do this from renewing your VISA.</p><p>Here’s the payment form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf</a></p><div class='title'><b>Application for Permanent Residence & Photo</b></div><p>1.      <span class='ja'>永住許可申請書</span><br/>2.      <span class='ja'>写真</span><br/>The first document is the application itself. Again, from renewing a VISA, all the same information is here with the addition of a short version of why you want permanent residence, work history, and guarantor information. For my reason, I wrote "I wish to obtain permanent residence to continue teaching in Japan indefinitely and continue my study of kendo and Japanese culture to further enrich myself." It sounds like a lofty reason, but I have fully explained it in the next section.</p><p>Here’s the application form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf</a></p><p>Additionally, you’ll need a 40mm x 30mm photo attached to your application.</p><div class='title'><b>Statement of Reason</b></div><p>3.      <span class='ja'>理由書</span><br/>Perhaps the part of this application that will take the longest is writing about why you want permanent residence in Japan. My short version stated that I wish to teach in Japan indefinitely and continue to learn about Japan, but those ideas are weak unless there is proof. In total, I wrote 3 pages about my time over the last 10 years.</p><p>I started with detailing my current responsibilities and accomplishments working at my high school: supporting English teachers in class, leading English writing classes, being an assistant Homeroom teacher, leading classes to prepare students for studying abroad, training students for speech contests and winning them, and teaching foreign exchange students Japanese language and culture.</p><p>Next, I detailed my accomplishments and responsibilities working in public elementary and junior high schools as part of the JET Programme, such as supporting English classes and training students for speech contests, but also volunteering in town for English conversations classes supporting the hospital and library, developing summer English camp and other events for students, and developing a full English curriculum for elementary schools.</p><p>Also, I detailed my responsibilities as a Regional Prefectural Advisory supporting other ALTs in my region and the prefecture by developing our biannual skills conferences and leading lectures and discussions about lesson planning and ideas, as well as lead monthly meeting for the ALTs in my town.</p><p>Finally, I closed my statement of reason with my contributions to the kendo federation in my town. I wrote about how I joined students in their club activities and practiced kendo, what I learned from doing kendo both personally and professionally, and eventually reaching the rank of 3-dan.</p><p>3 pages might have been too much for a statement of reason, but I wanted to completely show everything noteworthy that I’ve done in Japan. It was very direct and unemotional, focusing on the facts. My approach to writing the statement was very similar to writing a resume for an application. Overall, I don’t think the statement has to be completely emotionless, but I don’t think it should be the main focus of the argument. Show, don’t tell, as I say to my students.</p><p>Even though I wrote all this information in English, I had to rewrite everything in Japanese, too. I had some help with that. I included both English and Japanese versions of my statement in my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b></div><p>4.      <span class='ja'>身分関係を証明する次のいずれかの資料（該当しません）</span><br/>I am not Japanese, so this was not required for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Residence</b></div><p>5.      <span class='ja'>住民票</span><br/>Whenever you move somewhere in Japan, you must register at the town hall so it has a complete and up-to-date record of all of its residents. The application for permanent residence requires a print of this record. It was easy to get from my town’s registrar by filling out a request document and paying 300<span class='ja'>円</span> for them to print the record.</p><p>It has information, such as when you moved to town, current address, previous addresses, nationality, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Employment</b></div><p>6.      <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span><br/>In addition to proving that you live somewhere, you also need to prove that you work somewhere. This was pretty easy for me to get since my school is private and not that big. For a larger organization or a government organization, it might take some time for your request to go open the chain and for the document to come back down.</p><p>I just went to the office and they created a document that proved my employment. Depending on whichever company you work for, it may be an official document or it may not. I think it just needs to include a statement saying you work there as well as information that can be contacted later. My school/company just made up an official looking document with all the correct information on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b></div><p>7.      <span class='ja'>直近（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）の申請人及び申請人を扶養する方の所得及び納税状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Things start to get more complicated, as a single piece of paper proving your employment isn’t enough. Of course, you need to show that you’ve been paying taxes on the income that you’ve earned. And also show that you’ve been doing it for at least five years.</p><p>These documents include the <I>Kazei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>課税証明書</span> and the <I>Nozei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span>. Both documents translate as either Tax Certificate or Taxation Certificate, so looking at the English information about this section may not be helpful. Overall, the <I>Kazei</I> Tax Certificate details how much taxes you had to pay and what taxes you had to pay on your income within a given year. The <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate details the amount of taxes you still owe for a given year. Essentially, <I>Kazei</I> is like an itemized bill, and <I>Zozei</I> is the receipt.</p><p>Each document you’ll need for 5 years. For my town, I had a single <I>Kazei</I> Certificate for each year. For the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate, each year could be written on the same document. For each document, for each year, it cost 300<span class='ja'>円</span>. So for all the documents, my bill would’ve been 3000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>However, <I>update</I>, when I initially turned in my application, I forgot to get 5 years for the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate. I was able to turn in my application, but I needed to mail in the correct form within two weeks. They gave me an envelope and a sheet that described the document I was missing. Another problem, though: my town only keeps the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate up to 4 years, instead of the 5 years they wanted. I called them, and they said 4 years was fine. So, my bill was actually 2700<span class='ja'>円</span> for these documents.</p><p>Additionally! There’s another version of the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate that is required. Besides the Tax Record office in city hall, I went to my town’s official Tax Office. Requesting the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate from them shows them I’ve paid all debts and taxes across all government departments and agencies, as well as never missed any payment for any bills or loan. This document cost 500<span class='ja'>円</span> to print.</p><p>In addition, to these tax documents, I had to include a photo of my bank book that proved I was getting paid the correct income.</p><p>So, for this section, I included the following documents:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>課税証明書（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）</span>- Kazei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - Nozei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書（未払いの税金がないことを証明するためのパート</span>3<span class='ja'>）</span>- Nozei Cert proving no upaid taxes<br/>·        <span class='ja'>預貯金通帳（写し）</span>- Photo proving income.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b></div><p>8.      <span class='ja'>申請人の公的年金及び公的医療保険の保険料の納付状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Now that I had shown that I am legally employed, getting legally paid, and responsibly paying taxes on my legal income, I need to show that I’m paying into either my company’s pension or the government’s pension for at least two years. Also that I have health insurance.</p><p>This section was somewhat difficult to follow. Initially, I just took a photo copy of my annual pension report that I had gotten in mail, but (<I>update!</I>) apparently that wasn’t enough. A few days after I turned in my application, I got a letter in the mail requesting another form. The form they wanted detailed all of my pension payments, and each pension that I’ve contributed to. It was called the <I>Hihokenja Chousho Shoukai Kaitou-hyou</I> <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span> or the “Insurance Record Inquiry Report,” I think? I’m not sure why it says insurance when its about pensions.</p><p>To get this form, I had to go to my town’s Pension office and request these forms. Prior to going to the office, I had some co-workers give them a call to make sure I was getting the right forms, and they were able to prepare everything for me before I arrived. It turned a possible 40-minute wait into 5 minutes. This document was also 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Looking at this document, I’ve contributed into a government pension when I worked for the city as a teacher, and I’ve contributed to a private pension I have with my current job. </p><p>The letter wanted me to include receipts from any contributions to the government’s individual pension service, but I never did that, so I didn’t have any.</p><p>For the health insurance card, I just took a photo of it and blacked out the account number.</p><p>So, this is what I included from this section:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>ねんきん定期便（写し）</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>健康保険被保険者証（写し）</span></p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Financial Assets</b></div><p>9.      <span class='ja'>申請人又は申請人を扶養する方の資産を証明する次のいずれかの資料</span><br/>For the next part, I had to show all of Japanese financial assets. At minimum, I had to take photo copies of my bank statements to show how much money I have in Japan. I don’t have a house, so I didn’t have anything to show there. I do have a car, but I didn’t include any proof of that. Maybe I should have?</p><div class='title'><b>Passport Photo and Residence Card Photo</b></div><p>10.      <span class='ja'>申請人のパスポート（写し）</span><br/>11.      <span class='ja'>申請人の在留カード（写し）</span><br/>I included photo copies of my passport and residence card with my application, but this is not really necessary. When you turn in your application, you’ll need to also show them both of these, and they can take a photo copy themselves, at this time. I included these to save time.</p><div class='title'><b>Guarantor Information and References</b></div><p>12.      <span class='ja'>身元保証に関する資料</span><br/>A current Japanese citizen needs to vouch for who I am, what I stand for, and state that I would make a contribution to Japan by becoming a Japanese permanent resident. This person should be someone you know pretty well, and have a good relationship with. My principal at school has always sponsored my VISA, as well as other documents that required official clearance, so he was an easy choice as a guarantor.</p><p>They need to fill in the guarantor form and prove who they are. For my guarantor, we included the following:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>身元保証書</span> - the guarantor application<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証</span> - a photo copy of their ID (driver’s license, in this case)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span> - proof of employment, wherever they work.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - proof of tax payments. (<I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>住民票</span> - proof of residence.</p><p>Here’s the guarantor form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf</a> (Japanese)<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Contributions to Japan</b></div><p>13.      <span class='ja'>我が国への貢献に係る資料（</span>※<span class='ja'>ある場合のみで結構です。）</span><br/>This is the last meaty section of the application. For this section, I included my letters of recommendation and other certificates and awards of accomplishments. </p><p>In the end, I had 3 recommendation letters: one letter from the principal, one letter from the head of our English department, and one letter from head of the Kendo federation in my town. Each letter of recommendation talked about the contributions that I made to my school and kendo in town, and talked about why they think I should be awarded permanent residence.</p><p>Additional documents that I included were proof of things mentioned in either my Statement of Reason or their Letters of Recommendation. I included a photo of my kendo license showing participation for 10 years, my 3-dan diploma, and certificates of participation for 3 years in the international budo conference.

It doesn’t really seem like all that much once I finished making everything and putting it together. However, a lot of the time spent on the application is figuring out exactly what is required and where to go. The tax and pensions details are pretty tricky. I think my situation is pretty easy because I’ve only had the one job in the last 5 years, and the job is run by a professional organization. I also don’t have a house. Although, getting those documents probably aren’t too tough.</p><p>On February 13th, I drove up north to Toyama and turned in my application at Toyama Branch Office of the Nagoya Regional Immigration Bureau. A long time ago, I figured out that very few people actually go to this branch office, so the wait time is never more than 5 minutes. In Gifu, wait times can be as long as 45 minutes. And in Nagoya, a friend of mine waited for an hour and a half once.</p><p>Again, the clerk instantly noticed one probably with my application (the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate not being 5 years), so I had to submit that afterward. I also got a letter in the mail on February 17th about the pension document. But, they accepted my application, and I’ve mailed those requested document as soon as I could. All documents were submitted as of February 21st, and I have not received any more letters about any more problems.  I think it’s all good!</p><p>Typically these application can take up to six months to be completely reviewed and responded to, but the clerk mentioned that it may only take three months to be complete. Over the last three years, thanks to Covid, the number of people moving to Japan has significantly decreased because the government shut down travel.  Previously, my VISA application would take 4 weeks to get approved, but it only took a week last year.</p><p>Hopefully, by May, I’ll get the postcard in the mail to come back down and get my card. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Micro-aggressions in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/micro-aggressions-in-japan">Micro-aggressions in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 28, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year, at our second Skills Development Conference, I gave a quick speech about micro-aggressions.  I quickly talked about what they are, what's the problem, and how I deal with them.  I tried to give the topic justice as 2 years prior another ALT gave a similar talk about it, too, and I found it really helpful when dealing with some of the problems of daily life in Japan.</p><p>This was part of a session of "micro-panels" which is consisted of 4 shorter talks about various subjects.  Subjects not necessarily long enough or useful enough to take over their own 50 minute panel.  I budgeted this talk at 10-12 minutes.</p><p>I had some help with this presentation, too.  Fellow ALT and RPA Cathy Anatra volunteered for this subject, too.  Though, I pretty much took over the whole thing, and talked about the things I wanted to talk about.  She helped me QA the speech, and gave me some direction and pointers if I was missing anything.  She also gave some of her own personal experiences during that part of the talk.</p><p>But!  Here's what I wrote.  This is my intended transcript for my talk.  I also included most slides from my powerpoint, and the time-stamps from when I timed myself speaking.</p><div class='title'><b>Micro-aggressions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" /></p><p>The term "micro-aggressions" carries some baggage with it for those who have heard it before.  This is the definition I use:  A micro aggression is an everyday slight, indignity, or invalidation unintentionally made towards a marginalized group by a well-intentioned person of the majority.  In the case of Japan, the marginalized group would be us.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" /></p><p>These actions may seem small, and not even a problem, but day after day, they add up into something greater.  They not only make us feel different, but they point out how different we are to the society we are living in.  They point out that we don't fit in, and possibly that we won't fit in.  We're not the same, and we're outside of their circle.</p><p>I'm not talking about directly racist or insulting things, though.  I should really underline the terms "unintentionally" and "well-intentioned" in my definition because these are the comments I wish to focus on.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" /></p><p>I think the top 3 comments I've gotten over the years have been, "<span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>！", "<span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>？", and "<span class='ja'>何とか休みは帰りますか</span>？".  (or) "You're Japanese is so good!", "Can you eat natto?", and "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?"  Or even..  "where will you travel?"</p><p>We've all heard these haven't we?  <span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>?  Really?  I've said 2 poorly constructed sentences, and my Japanese is good?  <span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>?  Yes, I can eat natto.  Do you think it's poisonous to me, or something?  Am I too inferior to eat it?  <span class='ja'>帰りますか</span>?  Will I return?  Are you asking because I need to go back to "my people."  Because I don't belong here?  Because I'm an outsider?</p><p>Here are some more examples:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" /></p><p>These are the kind of micro-aggressions we all get a daily basis.  The first couple of times, it's no big deal, really.  But after months and years, they get tiring and their indirect messages become the real conversation. <br> [2.5 minutes]</p><p>Going back to my definition, this is not intentional.  The person talking to you is unaware of the underlying message being communicated.  They don't "mean" to make us feel alienated, or unwanted with these comments.  And this is why it's difficult to confront the "aggressor" about it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" /></p><p>If you confront the other person, and respond to their comments or questions in the same vain as I had just now, you can guarantee they won't make the mistake of talking to you again.  You've basically alienated yourself.  If you want to go more extreme with this example, perhaps you've now made this person think all westerners are confrontational about the smallest of comments or questions.</p><p>However, if you go the other way, by ignoring or shrugging off the comments, you're letting the problem persist.  And you've allowed yourself to soak up more of these comments.  They build and build, and eventually you revile and hate Japan.  If you want to go extreme again, perhaps you'll become a steaming pile of hate whom can never smile, and then no one will talk to you.  You've eventually leave Japan, and tell everyone how terrible a country it is.</p><p>In both instances, you've alienated yourself, and even created or perpetuated stereotypes.</p><p>So..  what's the solution?  You are.  We are.  I think we are the solution.  <br>[1.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" /></p><p>For me, I hadn't heard of this term before coming to Japan.  I first learned about it at our SDC two years ago.  I was at a point where after making friends with some teachers and parents, they made a couple of comments that pushed me back, and made me feel distant.  They made me feel like I didn't belong and wouldn't ever belong.</p><p>One of the things that turned me around was learning that this word even existed.  It gave me comfort, and it gave me strength.  This is the reason why I wanted to give this talk, and inform everyone about this word.  Knowing about this word allowed me contextualize the comments that were being made, rather than see them as direct assaults against me.  And through that I was able to deal with them appropriately.</p><p>As an example, at an enkai, one of my teachers kept talking to me in a baby voice.  I think we were talking about hiking and mountain climbing, and she kept responding very deliberately and emphatically.  It really felt like she was talking down to me.  <span class='ja'>そうですね。すごいですね。</span>Patronizing.  <span class='ja'>何とか山をのびますか。</span>As if she had to speak this way in order for me to understand.  </p><p>Even though it annoyed me, I just ignored it, and continued with the conversation.  A few minutes later, she began talking with another teacher, and she had the exact same tone.  And she continued that way throughout the rest of the night.  So it wasn't that she was talking down to me, or anything.  That's just the way she talks. <br>[2 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, my solution is not to confront, nor ignore, but to respond in a way that creates a conversation.  I think that's one of the most important responsibilities for us in Japan.  We should live up to our titles as unofficial cultural ambassadors.  We shouldn't directly confront their stereotypes about us, but we should bring them up from time and time, talk about them, and inform the other person about you as a person, rather than you as a race.</p><p>Going back to the natto conversation, I just respond with the truth.  Eh… it's okay.  Nothing special.  Do you like natto?  How often do you eat natto?  What food do you like or hate?  I try to pull them into the conversation, rather than it being one-sided.</p><p>Going back to the questions, "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?" or "..will you travel?"  I really see this more as an icebreaker for small talk.  While you could take it as them thinking your life in Japan is just a temporary home, I think a lot of them want to live vicariously through you.  They would love to have your "freedom" to travel around Japan, or the world.  They want to know more about these places, and how it related to their own lives.  And they want to know more about your home country, too.</p><p>This was even true at my previous job back in the US.  One of my co-workers' spouses said that she loved reading my blog, and looking through all the pictures I posted online from visiting Japan.  She liked to live vicariously through me because they don't really travel outside of the country that much.</p><p>Both these questions aren't assaults against you because you're different.  A lot of the time, many of those examples from earlier are just icebreakers.  Other people want to talk to you, and get your opinions on things that may be different for you.  It turns into an opportunity for you to inform and educate others about those differences.  It's usually a great topic of conversation.</p><p>Going back to the baby speech, sometimes if they talk to you like a baby, it could be that they just aren't aware of the amount of Japanese you understand, or perhaps they just don't know how to properly communicate with a foreigner.  Talking with them more often, and finding shared interests will give them more exposure to yourself, and to foreigners in general.  And make them more comfortable talking to us.</p><p>Overall, I would say to put yourselves in their shoes.  Think about where they're coming from when making some of these comments.  <br>[3.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" /></p><p>Lastly, I think it's important to understand that we can be just as guilty as making micro-aggressive comments or actions as they are.  It's important for us as we attempt to defuse micro-aggressions directed towards us, that we in-turn, identify and defuse any that we make ourselves.</p><p>I think the two most common ones for me are finding legitimate ways of complimenting or correcting other people's language, and finding ways of talking to Japanese people in English that doesn't sound like Tarzan-speech, or baby speech.</p><p>After receiving so many ill-gotten compliments on my Japanese, I never compliment anyone on how well they speak English because I'm too afraid of sounding like they do to me.  Though, I have a few teachers that have gotten A LOT better at English since I first met them that probably deserve some kind of compliment or reassurance because of how hard they've tried to get better.  I would say that if you were to compliment someone on their English, don't make a single one-off compliment.  Tell them why you think it's good, and why you felt you had to compliment them.  By giving them the reasons for the comments, it becomes sincere and worthwhile.</p><p>As far as talking like a baby, or talking like Tarzan, I think it's very important for us to speak as grammatically and emphatically correct as possible when using English around Japanese people.  Adults can definitely tell when they're being talked down to.  But for our students, we are the "perfect" model for them to learn correct English.  They listen to us way more than you might realize.  They have a keen ear for inflection, emphasis, and intonation.  If you're "dumbing down" your speech to be more understandable, some of those traits could be accidentally taught to them.</p><p>I have an example of this.  Sometimes when talking slow, I add unnecessary emphasis on some of my words.  Especially, the word "and."  One of my students did the speech contest last year.  I helped him write the English for his speech, and I recorded myself reading his speech, so he could practice it over and over again at home.  I used "and" as a conjunction between two sentences, like so, "So, I think one reason manga is so popular is the choice for readers.  And, I think it's fun to cosplay characters that appear in manga."</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" /></p><p>When speaking at normal speed, the "and" works as intended.  It's a soft conjunction joining the two sentences.  But, when I slow down, the "and" becomes much more pronounced.  It no longer sounds natural or correct if spoken at normal speed.</p><p>From that point on, whenever we read something in class that uses "and" as a conjunction, this student always has that extra unnecessary inflection.  Weirdly enough, my JTE has started doing it, too.</p><p>Again, this example isn't really a micro-aggression in of itself, but an example that your "model" of English, if thought correct, will be imitated.  Please keep it in mind.  <br>[4.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" /></p><p>Anyway, that's my speech, and that's my advice to you.  Thank you. :D</p><div class='title'><b>Finished</b></div><p>I don't think my talk had the same impact of when I first heard about micro-aggressions, but hopefully it inspired some of the audience members to think about things.</p><p>As mentioned before, this was part of a collection of micro-panels at our Skills Development Conference in January.  I was the MC for the entire panel, too, so I wrote an additional 3 minute speech to fill time at the end, if needed.</p><p>Later this year, I'll give this speech at our farewell enkai for those ALTs leaving the program.  It combines two things I've come across talking about foreigners or "outsiders" fitting into Japan.</p><p>Enjoy! :D</p><div class='title'><b>Fitting in Japan</b></div><p>I have another story about living in Japan, or abroad in general.  We are all circle people.  We lived in our circle country, spoke our circle language, and hung out with our circle friends.  We fit in.  Our circle pegs fit perfectly well into the circle holes of our lives.</p><p>But now we're in a triangle country.  Our circle pegs don't fit into the triangle holes.  Being here changes us.  We make many conscious and unconscious decisions on a daily basis that changes our circle shape to more closely resemble a triangle.  We lose some things, and gain some things.  The longer we stay, the more and more we become a triangle.  Though, obviously we can never fully be a triangle, but we can make ourselves fit in.</p><p>As we return to our circle country, we won't fit in at first.  As time goes on, our circle shape will return, but we'll never be as round as we once were.  The story finishes by saying we've become a shape that doesn't necessarily fit into either country.</p><p><br/>One of my students once wrote a speech on what it was like being half Japanese, and half American living in Japan.  Because she felt like she didn't fit in Japanese society, she always considered herself half Japanese.  She finally had the chance to visit the US, and while she physically felt like she fit in, she couldn't speak English well, and didn't really fit in there either.  She felt half American.  </p><p>She told this to her grandfather, and he gave her the following advice.  He was envious of her position.  He never thought of her as half Japanese, or half American, but BOTH Japanese and American.  He never saw her as half-anything.  She is a double.  That really changed the view she had on her own life.</p><p><br/>The experiences that we have in Japan, and the changes that happen to us, stay with us well after we leave.  They ultimately shape us into the people we will become, or into the people that we are.  While perhaps we think we're losing some of ourselves to fit in, we are gaining so much in the process.  And we eventually become part of both societies.<br>[3 minutes]</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Installing a USB CD Changer" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/installing-usb-cd-changing">Installing a USB CD Changer</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

My life is certainly different these days than it was a year ago.  Many things have changed, but I think I'm still pretty much the same.  It's quite a bit of fun.  There's always something new at school each day.

| August 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm sure I've seen Lost in Translation before today.  Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v7/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
