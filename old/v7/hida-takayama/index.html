It sits on a long expanse of flat plain lands, which was very lucrative for people back in the day to farm and grow rice. And it became an oasis for people who wanted to get away from war and battles in the low lands.</p><p>Even though Takayama is in the mountains, these flat open lands are wide enough to get much more sun than all the other villages and settlements in the valleys. On average, the temperature is about 5 degrees higher in Takayama in winter making it more comfortable.</p><p>I always imagined the shape of Takayama like a dish, flat with curved edges. And you can totally see this idea take shape from the observation deck at Mukodaira at the south end of town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The homes and neighborhoods creep up to the very edge of the hills and mountains to take maximum advantage of the available space.</p><p>Here's a large panoramic photo I put together:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From up here, on the south end of town, you have a clear view of Miya River <span class='ja'>宮川</span> as it snakes its way through town. You can also see Takayama Train Line and Route 41 coming from the same area through the valley to enter in Takayama's south side. You can see some of Takayama's schools, hotels, the southside grocery store, and Takayama's only porn store still in business somehow.</p><p>Despite living here for 13 years, I did not know of this vantage point until I was searching around on Google Maps and noticed it. Getting there is a little tricky, though. In this area of town, there's a small road between the two houses in the bottom photo. Just follow that road up into the mountain. It takes about 10 minutes to reach an area to park. From there, it's a quick 5 minute walk to the observation deck.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can even see the observation deck in the photo on top of the short mountain. There's nothing else up here, though. There's no shrine or temple. Most mountains have a shrine or marker at the top for a local diety, but here there's nothing. The observation deck feels like an afterthought after plowing through the mountain to make towers for powerlines.</p><p>At the base of the mountain, though, is Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine. Some of the shrine members were clearing snow from the walkways and setting up for a bonfire in the evening.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On a clear day, Mukodaira is a fun quick trip to see the town from a different point of view. It's easy enough to get there that you could even make the trip at night. Maybe I'll do that the next time they plan on having fireworks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane-in-2025">Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.</p><p>After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">I visited in 2013</a>, and both buildings were still standing. <a href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane">I visited again in 2015</a>, and the Junior High had been demolished.</p><p>It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp">the nearby construction sign</a>, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.</p><p>I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. </p><p>Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.</p><p>In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.</p><p>I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.</p><p>Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025">Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last year's theme focused on Kanamori Nagachika and various locations that were impacted by him. This year, the focus was on trees!</p><p>There are several millenia old trees in Takayama, but Takayama also has a rich history in carpentry and craftsmanship in wood arts. After the area was taken over by Kanamori in the late 1500s, he recognized the unique carpentry skills of the residents and cultivated their ability. Many of the resulting woodwork would be used for buildings throughout Gifu, Nagoya, and Kyoto.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just like last year, the event was hosted at the Takayama City Museum and also just like last year, it was advertised very little. I think the posters at the entrance of the museum were the only indication it was happening. Once again, I didn't hear about it until a local friend sent me a message. Here's the link for information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/">https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my third photo rogaining event. I joined <a href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="/takayama-photo-rogaining">last year's Takayama Rogaining event</a> as my first. Prior, I had never heard of this kind of event before. The etymology of Rogaining comes from the three people who coined the term, Roy, Gail, and Neil, and they first began using the term in the 70s. However, Photo Rogaining isn't all that different from Orienteering which dates back to 1897.</p><p>Overall, it's like a marathon, but you create your own path. 20 or 30 minutes prior to the start of the race, runners or teams of runners are given a map and a list of checkpoints. Runners have no knowledge of this leading up to the start.</p><p>Here were the map and list of checkpoints for this year:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Each checkpoint has a different point value. For each checkpoint you visit, that point value is added to your total. The team or runner with the highest point value wins. Photo Rogaining goes one step further by requiring runner to take photos of the target at each checkpoint. You are meant to recreate the photos listed on the checkpoint sheet.</p><p>Each Orienteering or Rogaining event has a strict time limit, so you must reach the finish line within the time limit while collecting as many checkpoints as possible. The Takayama Photo Rogaining event has a limit of 3 hours. You are deducted 30 points each minute you are late.</p><div class='title'><b>Bonus Points</b></div><p>As an added bonus (or headache), the Takayama Rogaining event adds some extra bonus points. Last year, you could gain an extra bonus point for every photo you took of Kanamori Nagachika's name written out on a sign for a total of 20 bonus points. I didn't quite understand this last year, so I ignored it. Ultimately I lost 2nd place by 4 points. :/</p><p>This year's bonus points were much more cryptic and numerous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Part 1 were the normal <span class='ja'>通常</span> bonus points. At four of the checkpoints (numbers 1, 17, 25, 47), if you took an additional photo matching the ones posted, you could get an extra 5 points each. This was very clear and easy to understand. Find the stuff, and take a photo. Got it!</p><p>Part 2 were the secret <span class='ja'>秘密</span> bonus points. There were 3 different collections of locations that each followed the theme posted on the board. If you went to each of the locations that matched the theme, you would be awarded either 40 or 30 bonus points.</p><p>The three themes were as follows:<br/>Theme 3 - 40 points - 1000<span class='ja'>年の時を見てきた長生きの木</span><br/>Theme 2 - 30 points - 400<span class='ja'>年の時をつなぐ</span>4<span class='ja'>人の飛騨の匠</span><br/>Theme 1 - 30 points - 100<span class='ja'>年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業</span></p><p>At a glance, I just noticed 1000-year-old trees, 400-year-old takumi, and 100-year-old carpenters. At the time, I thought, Yeah, I could correctly translate these to understand them completely. However, I would have no idea which locations would match these descriptions. So, I choose to not focus on them and hope my path would collect these locations.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the time came, we were able to open our maps and start plotting our courses. Having done these events twice now, I have learned that you want to make big swings towards the distant areas first, and clean up the points near the finish at the end. If you spend too much time getting all the near points at the beginning, you may not have enough time to get the high valued places further out.</p><p>This year's far out locations were nearly the same as last year's. So my plan was to grab a few near checkpoints while heading further west to Hida no Sato and the Shingu neighborhood. From Shingu, head directly north to the Kumano Shrine, which <a href="/old/v7/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter" title="/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter">I visited back in February</a>. And then head back downtown to grab any more points I could before the finish.</p><p>My plan was also to not get any checkpoints that required backtracking unless I had the time for it and they were high value.</p><div class='title'><b>Start!</b></div><p>At Noon, the bell was rung and the museum bay doors were open allowing everyone to spill out into the street and start running in their directions.</p><p>I immediately went to the 3 checkpoints clustered together at Nakabashi.

It's like the opposite feeling after completing a marathon. In both cases, poor training can result in poor times, but for Rogaining, there's always the worry of whether or not you are following the optimal path for your ability.</p><p>Anyways, I was only able to do two Rogaining events this year. I signed up for a third, but it was held only two days after this Takayama event. My legs were ruined the whole weekend, so it was impossible for me to join. I spent the rest of the weekend building that Lego Gameboy. (They sent me a map, though, so I could mentally practice.)</p><p>I'll try to do more next year! Maybe this time I will have the proper motivation to train for them. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Juunigatake in Autum 十二ヶ岳" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/juunigatake-in-autum">Juunigatake in Autum 十二ヶ岳</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

(Although, if a bear showed up, it's not going to care that I have a bell.)</p><p>The trail entrance wasn't too far away. It was around just a few bends of the mountain road. On the edge of one of the bends, was a small, yet clear sign indicating the entrance of the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail left the dirt road and went up into the trees.

It is a retro museum that showcases many common things from Japanese homes and businesses of the Showa Era (roughly 1927 to 1989).

Tourism in Takayama has exploded since my first years living here, so many changes have also happened in Showa Hall. You can see those changes <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall-2" title="/showa-hall-2">in the 2023 post</a>.</p><p>But, even since 2023, there have been more changes, specifically upstairs. In 2023, they had a small video game annex running Super Famicom Minis with cartridges and posters on the wall. They have since removed all of their old music memorablia near there and created a replica of a children's room with several toys and video games connected to old TVs. This is much more of a Heisei room than a Showa room.</p><p>I took several photos of the new area, and some of other areas, too.

To become less digital and more analogue. There are very few lights at Doai Onsen and after 10pm, the generator is turned off. The hallways and rooms are only illuminated by lantern at that point, of which there are more than 300 at the inn in various styles.

They have a very modern website which made it easy to reserve a room and the prices were very good compared to other expensive onsens and ryokans. Only 15000<span class='ja'>円</span> (~$100) a night, which includes dinner and breakfast.</p><p>After an obnoxious lunch, we arrived around 4pm. There was a bit of confusion on when we were supposed to arrive, but it all worked out. Check-in official began at 3pm, but we could still arive by 5pm. We were sharing the inn with 2 other groups. One group was just a mother and son. The other group was a larger older family of about 6 people. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inn seemed like the perfect size for our 3 groups. I don't know if any of the rooms had names, but we were given the room nearest to the entrance. There were two connected tatami rooms that were opened up so we had a really large space, a total of 20 tatami mats!  The group of 6 had the whole lower wing to themselves, so they probably had probably double the space.</p><p>While some others had already arrived, we were able to hop in the baths first and have them to ourselves before the other groups. Dinner was served around 6:15pm (later than usual), so there was a lot of time to soak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were separated baths for men and women which alternated in the night and morning. The men had the larger bath in the evening. The baths are kept warm from a wood burning stove underneath, known as the Goemon method. However, heated water from the tap is boiled using electricity from the generator.</p><p>There were two baths available. Both were filled with spring water from the mountain. One was full of water that was naturally heated by the thermals of the mountain. The other was from cool spring water that was manually heated. Both contain the natural minerals that onsen in the mountains are known for, such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, essentially). These baths repair and soothe rough skin and cuts by eating away at dead skin on the surface.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love sitting in the warm baths. Natural onsens are my favorite. :) The open window looked out over the gorge with the Tsukechi river below. There were the 3 of us in the bath, so we were talking about things. But, it is always nice to just sit in the bath and listen the wind blow through the leaves and the water flow through the river. There were hot and cold taps for the baths, so I could douse myself with cold water when I felt I was getting too hot.</p><p>It was still pretty early out, but it would've been really nice to come back after the sunset and soak in the tub only lit by lantern light. The lanterns keep the insects away, so you could just relax.</p><p>We stayed in the baths for about 40 minutes and were leaving just as the next group came in. We goofed around in the room for about an hour until the hostess notified everyone of dinner.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The dinner was incredible. Often when dinner is served at an enkai or ryokan, there is usually not enough (for me) to go around. I'm always leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could've had more. This was not the case at Doai. The meal began with mountain vegetables <span class='ja'>山菜</span>, tofu, mochi, and some Iwana sashimi. Iwana is the most common and prevalent fish in the rivers of these moutanins, and local restaurants often serve it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>More and more dishes kept coming out. We had baked Iwana, tempura, and a very large Gohei mochi. Gohei mochi <span class='ja'>五平餅</span> is fried mochi on a stick with a sweet syrup sauce painted on the top. They are usually the size of a popsicle, but this beast was larger than most pancakes. It was so good.</p><p>It was an amazing meal with so much delicious food. One of the best meals I've had in a while.</p><p>With dinner finished, we had the lamp and safety demonstration at 7:30pm. I thought that this would take only a couple of minutes so I could be back in the onsen bath before they closed, but the lamp demonstration was only the beginning of the night's activities.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Arriving in the common area, we were given a puzzle, a wooden needle threaded in a denim jacket. "Remove the needle from the jacket and get a prize!" It seemed pretty easy and I remember seeing a similar looking puzzle on YouTube a while ago where a person removed a bike lock from a lamp post. That was a different solve, though.</p><p>We fumbled around at the puzzle until everyone arrived and began the lamp demonstration. The host explained how to correctly light the lamp by achieving the correct flame size after lighting the wick with a match. The two sides of the flame should create an arch when holding the glass above the flame, creating an image that kinda looks like Batman. If the flame is too intense, there's too much wick. The reverse is true too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He also mentioned that because the wick is completely soaked in oil, it never burns itself. The wick isn't like the wick of a candle. If the flame dies down, it's because of the oil running low, not because the wick is too low. As such, you should never push too much of the wick out of the base. In the short term, you might get the light you want, but after an hour there will be a massive flame burning out of the lantern. ALWAYS make sure the initial lighting creates the batman shape, and the lantern will be fine for the whole night.</p><p>Also, when you want to extinguish the flame, don't mess with the wick. Simply blow over the top of the glass and the air circulation will put out the light.</p><p>We were each given our own lantern to light the correct way. The wicks were already in the best position, so we didn't have to mess with it. After striking our match and lighting the wick, we just observed the flame's shape to verify it was correct.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then, continuing with lighting lanterns, he had us lighting the lamps using the arcane method of flint and steel, the same way his Japanese ancestors like lanterns. We started off with a standard cut of steel against stones. But, if we couldn't handle it, we could use easier steel which guaranteed sparks. Every strike on the flint should try and knock the sparks into some padded cloth, and then attempt to transfer the spark into the lantern to light it.</p><p>It was not so easy. I could not get the right angle or I was holding it too hard. I moved on to the easy steel and sparks were flying immediately. Lighting the lantern was so much easier using the "starter" steel. Zach and Dirk were much better at using the true steel method.</p><p>Moving on from the lantern, there were many more activities. We continued with the wooden thread puzzle, and he continued to give us more and more hints until we understood how to solve it. Upon solving it, we could keep the wooden needle and as a prize, we were given an extra one to give to a friend.

The host said there were more games in the morning, and you can win a prize if you remember how to tie the ropes.

Each group could take a lantern back to the room to use after lights out.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the generator off, the lanterns were dim, but being out in the pitch darkness of the forest boosted their glow considerably. The hallways filled with the warm light. Although, if we had to use the bathroom, we just used the light on our phones.</p><p>If I was alone, I would have loved to fall asleep to the wind in the trees and the water in the river. But, I put in my earphones to guarantee that I could actually sleep through the night without waking from the smallest of sounds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The morning came and the light filled our room. It was around 6:30, I think? I heard some odd pinking sound, which I thought was water drops tinking into a thin metal gutter. It was not. </p><p>Some of the other family members were in the common area with the host's BB rifle shooting at a tin target in the forest. I went to join them and shot a few rounds. If you called your shot and hit the target within 2 tries, you won a prize, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp">a compact flint and steel set with some cloth to catch the spark</a>.</p><p>The baths were open at 7am, so I went back to the room to gather my things for the bath.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We were on the left side now. It was the same layout, except the baths were slightly smaller. It was totally fine though. You don't want to stay in the bath for very long in the morning, otherwise you'll waste all your strength for the day. I think I spent about 15 minutes in the water as others came and went.</p><p>Back in the common area, more of us gathered to shoot airguns and play with the wooden games he had laid out. Those host asked us if we remembered the knot tying from the previous night. By performing the knot successfully, the prize was a bear bell to use in the forest when hiking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At 8 o'clock, our breakfast was served. More mountain vegetables, Iwana, Miso soup, and other staples of a Japanese breakfast. Plenty of rice, too.</p><p>After breakfast, we continued shooting guns and playing games in the common area and were given <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7626.webp">our bill for our stay</a>.

I think it would be even better paired with hiking in the area prior to staying the night.

Gaudy yes, but really impressive on the inside.</p><p>The Hikaru Museum has an outside facade of a pyramid. Inside, the pyramid is completely hollow with its open area following the contours of the pyramid. There are three main levels of the pyramid and each level has several exhibition halls.</p><p>The bottom floor has special exhibition halls with rotating exhibits. For Fall 2025, these exhibits were the Hokusai Ukiyoe exhibit, the Serizawa Keisuke exhibit, and an exhibit called Pissarro, which seemed to be some guy's collection of classic European art.  The next floor up had established exhibits which focused on civilization's history in the world, Japan, and Hida. And the top floor had a calligraphy exhibit (which was extra) and some other exhibits that were being renovated. You could also go outside and view the top of the pyramid.</p><p>Despite being funded by a cult and having incredibly odd architecture for Japan, the museum was really impressive. </p><p>Entry was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> with a year pass set at 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>.

It's now all that remains of the Iiyama family and castle, which was said to be a psuedonymn of Asahina Saburou <span class='ja'>朝比奈三郎</span>.</p><p>I went to the area because I was looking around at locations of castle ruins in Takayama. I had never noticed this before, nor really knew anything about it. Also, Google Maps didn't even have a road going to it, so it seems like an interesting place to investigate.</p><p>To reach the temple, there's an unremarkable unpaved side road that goes up a hill through some farms. The farmland is still being used, so some rice planting equipment was on the side of the road. The narrow roads winds up the hill as most side roads do, and the forest opens up to reveal the temple and a rather large garden with some old folks doing their various gardening.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Being the height of June, all the plants and grass have grown to take over much of the area. There were several historical plaques posted near the temple with each more recent plaque having more detailed information of the history and significance of the temple. I made a separate post with full <a href="/old/v7/iiyama-temple-translations" title="/iiyama-temple-translations">transcriptions and translations</a> of those plaques.</p><p>The legend of the temple begins with Asahina Saburou, a legend of Japanese folklore. After his defeat in the Heiji Rebellion, he apparently fled to Hida and lived in hiding by changing his name to Iiyama. At this location, at the foot of the mountain, he built his castle and estate. Although, the plaque says that the rebellion was in 1159, but Wikipedia says Asahina was born in 1176, so who knows.</p><p>After building his estate, he ultimately came into possession of a statue of the eleven-headed Kannon. He built a hall within his estate to house and display the statue. This hall was named Reishoin <span class='ja'>霊松院</span>. The hall was later refashioned into a temple in 1339 for the statue.</p><p>Later, Miki Yoritsuna (1540-1587) invaded Hida and burned down Iiyama's castle and estate, along with the temple. Miki built <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Matsukura Castle</a> on the top of that mountain to defend the region.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After the Kanamori Clan swept through Hida and conquered it, Kanamori <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> ordered a Shingon monk to rebuild the temple at its current location, which was said to be where Iiyama Castle and estate once stood. The temple was renamed Toukouzan Iiyama Temple <span class='ja'>東向山飯山寺</span>. This was in 1604.</p><p>In the Edo Period, with Tokugawa Shogunate in full control of Japan, a priest named Genkai <span class='ja'>玄海</span> began the revival of state sanctioned Buddhism. He moved to Takayama and lived in Iiyama Temple as he helped rebuild and shape Kokubunji Temple downtown. He also rebuilt Ichinomiya Shrine to the south. The Buddhism revival attracted many lords and people, so the temple flourished again. The current worship hall at Iiyama Temple was part of Ichinomiya Temple reconstruction, and later moved here.</p><p>Inside the temple, the wooden statue of the eleven-headed Kannon is still there, according to the plaque. All of the doors were closed, and the entrances were covered in screens for protection against animals. For a time, the temple was home to two works by the Japanese Monk, Enku <span class='ja'>円空</span>, both of which are designated as cultural properties of Gifu prefecture. Those works are now on display in the Takayama City Museum.</p><p>Despite the Temple having been largely abandoned, every seven years the temple opens again for the public to view the priceless statues inside. Although, apparently, this practice may have stopped in 2021.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Near the exit to the forest was a small collection of Ojizosama. It seemed like it had been several years since they've been tended to. One of the Jizos didn't even have a face anymore.</p><p>The Ojizosama statues offer two kinds of protection. One of these protections are for children who have died too early in life. As a child's soul passes into the afterlife, it doesn't have its parents to guide them. So, the Jizo-sama protect them like a parent.</p><p>These days, I think the more common protection of these statues is for travelers, which is why you see these statues everywhere when driving around in the mountains. The Jizo-sama protect people traveling long distances and help them reach their destination.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the hill, there are a few more statues and monuments, but many of them had been knocked over by snow melt. Now, they've become buried again from the high grass. Up on the hill behind the temple and behind the monuments was a cellphone tower. The cellphone tower seems like it gets more attention these days than the temple.</p><p>Upon entering and leaving the area, you pass by a small shrine on the side of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The stone sign next to it says it's the Iiyama Temple Children's Area <span class='ja'>飯山寺子供地域</span>. Back in the day, this might make sense as an area for the Temple's children to use while the adults perform the festival at the main temple. Nowadays, the road to the temple goes directly passed it, so it's only still here for preservation.</p><p>Again, the road leading to the temple is a fairly unremarkable side road off of Route 41. The side road used to be masked by a construction company and their large building, but I feel like they had been slowly going out of business over the last several years. Now, this main building has been completely demolished. Looking through Google, it must've happen in the last 6 months, which is really recent.</p><p>It's remarkable to go around Japan and find pockets of rich history. But, it's also almost just as remarkable how fast they can tear down their modern buildings when their business moves or changes. Living in Takayama for over 12 years, there have been so many changes.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/hida-takayama/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
