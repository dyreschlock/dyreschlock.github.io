According to the Internet, we've received about 85 cm since this time yesterday.  And by this time yesterday, teachers were convinced that amount had already fallen.  It certainly doesn't seem like we've accumulated nearly 5 feet of snow, but I guess it's possible.</p><p>Takayama City actually canceled school today, which is almost unheard of.  For most teachers in Takayama, they can't remember a time of school ever being canceled due to snow.  (Though, they seem to cancel school pretty often for typhoons.)  Yesterday, school was let out early, too.</p><p>But!  While school is canceled, that doesn't mean it's a day off for the teachers.  We still must come to school because it's our job.  This morning I cleared more than a foot of snow off of my car, and had to shovel a path in front of my car in order to make it onto the road.  One of my neighbors had his car stuck and blocking traffic, too, so I helped push his car out of the ditch.  But I made it to school on time.  No problem.</p><p>At school, all of us teachers went outside, shoveled snow, and knocked snow off of the trees.  There was definitely more than 3 feet of snow piled up on the school grounds, so maybe we have accumulated 5 feet overall.  After that, we dispersed throughout the neighborhood to check for any "dangers".</p><p>Today, I'm at Minami Elementary School, which is located near the center of town near the train station.  Because this school is so centrally located, there are no buses.  All students walk to school, so when we check for "dangers", we're basically verifying that the routes students take to get to school are safe for the students to travel.  I guess I'm not sure what we were actually looking for.  Sinkholes?  Or downed power lines?  The routes I (and another teacher) checked were clear of those dangers.  Though, the snow was piled up so much that anyone walking was basically forced into the streets.  I figured that was pretty dangerous.</p><p>But whatever... Students weren't coming to school today anyhow.  As I walked around, I took several photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp"/></a></p><p>We basically just cover the north-western blocks from the school to the supermarket to the river and back.  Plenty of residents were outside shoveling snow, and clearing their cars and driveways.  We didn't see any kids, though, which was weird.  You'd think they'd be running around playing in the snow.  Though, I suppose the streets were pretty dangerous with oncoming traffic.</p><div class='title'><b>Shoveling Snow in Takayama</b></div><p>There is one big difference between shoveling snow in the Midwest and in Japan.  In the Midwest, you typically shovel snow from your driveway into your yard.  However, in Japan, there are no yards.  At least, not in the city area.  Thankfully, I live near a river.  So, when it snows enough to be shoveled, my whole neighborhood just shovels all the snow into the river.</p><p>During our neighborhood safety check, plenty of citizens were doing the same.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp"/></a></p><p>If you live near a river, you basically fill up one of those sleds with snow, drag it to the river, and chuck in it.  And repeat until complete.  Sometimes, residents will fill up a pickup truck with snow, and then drive to the river and dump it.</p><p>Another method for the more landlocked neighborhoods of Takayama is using the gutters on the sides of the roads.  There is enough water running in Takayama, that it never freezes.  Some neighborhoods open up the gutters running on the sides of the streets, and shove the snow inside.  The running water melts the snow, and carries it away.  These neighborhoods are usually tightly packed, so they don't really have a lot of snow to shovel anyway.  It's usually just the strip of sidewalk in front of their house.</p><p>One other method by the lazy residents of town is shoveling the snow into the street.  In a typical winter Takayama day, it snows throughout the night, and warms up a bit during the day.  The warmth during the day usually melts whatever snow collected on the roads overnight.  So by pushing the snow in the streets, cars will run over it, and the daily warmth will melt and get rid of it.  It's still lazy, though.</p><p>Anyway...  maybe the snow was stop tonight some time, and we'll actually have class tomorrow.  Or maybe not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I drove down to Nagoya to listen to some music.  Nagoya is almost directly south from Takayama.  When taking the Express Way, it's pretty much direct.  Just go south, and you're nearly there.  It's about a 2 1/2 hour drive, so I compare it to a drive from Madison, WI to Chicago.</p><p>However, there is one huge difference between those two drives:  <b>elevation</b>.  Takayama sits in an open plateau on the west end of the Japanese alps surrounded by some of the tallest mountains in Japan.  Nagoya is a port city near the Pacific Ocean.  So while the temperature drops, and the snow begins to fall in Takayama, it's still Autumn down in Nagoya.</p><p>And the drive between Takayama and Nagoya highlights these seasonal changes in a mere 2 hour span.  I took photos on the way down, and on the way back.  Here's my trip on the way back:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In Nagoya, it was partly cloudy.  This was at 11:00am.  The sky wasn't a pure blue, but there were breaks that let the sun shine through.  As I got out of the main urban sprawl of Nagoya into Ichinomiya, I was traveling directly north, and pointed towards a storm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those road signs above mention that at Seki <span class='ja'>関</span> and Minokamo <span class='ja'>美濃加茂</span>, there are safety checks to ensure drivers are properly applying and using chains on their tires.  It was still totally clear.</p><p>I crossed prefectural lines into Gifu-ken <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>.  As I approached Seki, I entered the storm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the snow raged, it immediately melted when it touched the ground.  I was still south enough where the ground was warm.</p><p>As I continued, the houses began showing snow collecting on the roofs.  I reached Minokamo, and all traffic was diverted into the rest area.  Traffic officials were present to check cars for winter tires and chains, and help anyone putting chains on their tires.  After returning to the Express Way, snow began to collect on the ground.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The roads were still totally safe.

I say, "technically," because it was really more like rain that froze into ice and hail before it hit the ground and then immediately melted.  I was outside playing tag with the 2nd graders at the time, too.  It was certainly not snow.  After lunch, the hail started picking up a little bit, but nothing stayed solid on the ground for more than a second or two.

| October 10, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Complementing the Spring festival held in April, this week was Takayama's Fall Matsuri <span class='ja'>秋の高山祭</span>.  The Spring festival celebrates the Sanno Shrine <span class='ja'>山王神社</span>, and takes places on the southern end of downtown Takayama.  I wrote about that one here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.  The Fall festival is on October 9th and 10th, and centers on the Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>八幡神社</span>.  This is the more northern area of downtown Takayama, and is much closer to my house. :)</p><p>Thousands of tourists, both domestic and foreign, come to Takayama to view the beautiful and hand-crafted festival floats, or yatai <span class='ja'>屋台</span>.  The floats are pulled out of storage, and displayed for the town to see.  Every year, there are marionette performances <span class='ja'>からくり奉納</span>, and a procession of the shrine <span class='ja'>御巡幸</span>.  At night, the floats are lined with lanterns, and paraded through town.  </p><p>This year, the crowds were really sparse.  Perhaps only one thousand people actually attended.  The newspaper blamed the eruption of Ontake-yama, and the recent typhoons.</p><p>Both festival days were weekdays, so I could only attend the night parade, as usual.  This was better than last year, though, which had the night parade canceled due to rain.</p><div class='title'><b>Night Parade <span class='ja'>夜祭</span></b></div><p>I arrived after the parade started, but that's fine.  It began at 6pm, and continued until 8:30pm or 9pm.  It mostly circled through the streets downtown, so it was very easy to go down side streets and catch up with the start of the parade.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last few floats were still waiting at the starting point when I reached Hachiman shrine.  Circling around to the start was easy.  I tried to watch the Shi-shi performance, but the crowd was too large to get a good view.  One of my 4<span class='ja'>年生</span> students found me.  She's a tiny girl less than a meter tall.  She could not see either.  </p><p>She had me follow her to the next point ahead of the parade, and we waited while see showed me her pictures.  There were almost no people there either, so we had a front view of everything.  The Shi-shi arrived and waved to the crowd.  All of the teenage and child Shi-shi dancers were students of mine (past and present).  One yelled out, "Hey Jimu!"  The whole crowd was silent as I replied, "Hello!"</p><p>They continued walking on, and the floats followed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are 11 floats in the Takayama Fall Festival.

During the harvest moon the remaining fields are collected.  Now, it's the hunter's turn to gather food for the winter.</p><p>I observed the Harvest Moon last month: <a href="/old/v7/september-moon" title="/september-moon">September 8th</a>.  I was lucky because this happened to be a Super Moon as well.</p><div class='title'><b>Wednesday October 8th</b></div><p>This month's full moon was also a coincidence of two celestial events.  As the full Hunter's Moon continued into Wednesday night, a total lunar eclipse happened as well.  When this occurs, the moon darkens, and turns red from the residual light.  In effect, this creates a "blood" moon.</p><p>Wednesday evening's weather was even more clear than Tuesday.  For the first time since Spring, you could completely view Norikura-dake, and the Kita Alps.  You could even see the steam still rising from Ontake-yama's eruption.  As I returned home from work, the moon was no where in the sky.  At 5pm the previous night, the moon was a fixture in the sky.  Now, nothing was in the sky.  Meh, I ate dinner.</p><p>Next to Hida Takayama High School, on Nakayama (i think?) is a park that completely overlooks the town.  Skypark <span class='ja'>スカイパーク</span> has a clear view of the eastern sky as well, which is where the moon will rise.  I went there at 5:30pm, and several other moon gazers had the same idea.  Photographers lined the edge of the park looking at the town, and prepared for the moon.  Several others continued to arrive.</p><p>Clouds had moved in, so Norikura was no longer visible.

It's peak is on the border of Furukawa Town <span class='ja'>古川</span> in Hida City <span class='ja'>飛騨市</span> and Kokufu town <span class='ja'>国府</span> in Takayama City <span class='ja'>高山市</span>.  From the summit, you can see all of downtown Furukawa.  It was another great day on Saturday morning, so I woke up early and took off toward Furukawa.</p><p>There are 3 ways to reach the summit of Anbousan.  Here is the correct way:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7913_t.webp"></a></p><p>In Furukawa, between Kita Wakamiya Shrine <span class='ja'>気多若宮神社</span>, and Yoshiki High School <span class='ja'>吉城高校</span>, there's a graveyard.  And behind that graveyard, there's a small parking lot.  Past that parking lot, the road continues into the forest, and connects with the trail entrance.  From here, the sign indicates it will take an hour to ascend the mountain and reach the summit.</p><p>But, I didn't do that.  There are 2 additional ways to reach the summit.  One of which is going through the Taie neighborhood <span class='ja'>太江</span> west of the mountain.</p><p>In the Taie neighborhood, there's a sign pointing toward a farm.  I drove past the sign, through the farm, and reached a gate.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7531.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7531.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7535.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7535.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7535.webp" /></p><p>This gate is not locked.  In fact, the sign says <span class='ja'>ゲートを開けたら心ず閉めて下さい</span>, which means, <i>"If you open the gate, please close the gate."</i>  Entry is not prohibited.  I think it's just meant the keep out bears, and other wildlife.</p><p>As the sign indicates, it's a quick 6 km drive to reach the summit.  Parking is directly next to the summit.  Using this route, there is no climbing at all.  The road is completely paved, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7557_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I reached the summit around 7:30 in the morning.

But, you could totally see all of Furukawa.  You could see the station <span class='ja'>古川駅</span>, the museum, route 41, Furukawa elementary school <span class='ja'>古川小</span>, Furukawa junior high school <span class='ja'>古川中</span>, Yoshiki high school <span class='ja'>吉城高校</span>, too…  everything.</p><p>Unfortunately the trees and hills of the east obstructed views of Kokufu.

I figured the clouds would eventually clear up, but I didn't want to wait around for an hour or two.  So, I continued toward the other interesting part of the area, Kojima castle ruins <span class='ja'>小島城</span>.</p><p>There was a fork in the road a few kilometers back.  Taking a left brought me to the summit.  Taking a right will bring me to the castle ruins.  I made my way back to the fork, and continued toward the ruins.</p><p>Unfortunately, this road was not as well kept as the road leading to the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140927_anbousan/IMG_7718_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cracks and fissures separated parts of the road.  This was probably a nice dirt road before the typhoon and floods and all that.

He built Kojima castle <span class='ja'>小島城</span> to defend Hida.  He created a few other defending castles in the area as well.  In fact, throughout time, this whole area had more than a dozen castles and forts.</p><p>I was at the ruins for a little while, and I noticed the sky has really opened up.  All the clouds that darkened the view from before had gone away.

Again, near the entrance is Kita Wakamiya Shrine <span class='ja'>気多若宮神社</span>, one of the more prominent shrines in Furukawa.  Behind this shrine are a series of dams that lead up the mountain.  The trail for Anbousan follows the dams and rivers.  I reached this area about an hour after I left the summit.  I met up with the same group of hikers from the summit, too.</p><p>Anyway, that's Anbousan.  You can drive to the summit, and view all of Furukawa from the peak.  I would love to go here while the sun sets and see what the town looks like.  I might be able to get up here during the winter, too, provided someone plows, or the snow on the road melts.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>7:10am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Taie Gate <span class='ja'>太江ゲート</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361">N36° 15' 16.47", E137° 11' 12.25"</a></td></tr><tr><td>7:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>7:30am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Anbousan Summit <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917">N36° 14' 59.28", E137° 12' 46.05"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:00am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:10am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kojima Castle Ruins <span class='ja'>小島城</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2517861,137.1747528" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2517861,137.1747528">N36° 15' 6.43", E137° 10' 29.11"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:35am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>8:45am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Anbousan Summit <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2498,137.2127917">N36° 14' 59.28", E137° 12' 46.05"</a></td></tr><tr><td>9:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Fork in the road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2508556,137.1830278">N36° 15' 3.08", E137° 10' 58.9"</a></td></tr><tr><td>9:10am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Taie Gate <span class='ja'>太江ゲート</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.254575,137.1867361">N36° 15' 16.47", E137° 11' 12.25"</a></td></tr><tr><td>9:45am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Anbousan Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>安峰山</span> <span class='ja'>登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2436722,137.2059583" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2436722,137.2059583">N36° 14' 37.22", E137° 12' 21.45"</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ontake-yama Eruption 御嶽山噴火" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ontake-eruption">Ontake-yama Eruption 御嶽山噴火</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 29, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Saturday, around noon, the nearby mountain, Mt. Ontake <span class='ja'>御嶽山</span>, erupted spewing ash and debris into the air.  The ash cloud shot into the air and completely covered sky.  Some eye-witness hikers reported that day almost immediately turned to night.  The ash rained down on the upper areas of the mountain, and covered the terrain.  Some area have a layer of ash at least a meter thick.</p><p>It was a beautiful clear early autumn day, so the mountain had plenty of hikers out to conquer the mountain.  Many of those hikers are now stranded at the mountain's summit building.  Others are still missing.  Others have been confirmed dead.</p><p>The eruption was unexpected, so there was no time to warn anyone on the mountain.  The last seismic activity observed from the mountain was in 2007.  And it lay dormant since.</p><p>I have never lived so close to an erupting volcano before.  So, yesterday, I drove out there to take a look for myself.  Additionally, I wanted to collect a jug full of ash.</p><div class='title'><b>Location</b></div><p>Mt. Ontake is the second largest mountain in Japan at 3067 meters above sea level.  It's located on the border between Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span> and Nagano prefecture <span class='ja'>長野県</span>.  In Gifu, Mt. Ontake is in the Hida region.  Part of the mountain is in the Takayama city area <span class='ja'>高山市</span>, in the village of Takane <span class='ja'>高根村</span>, in the Hiwada neighborhood <span class='ja'>日和田</span>.  This is the very south-eastern outskirts of Takayama.  Up until 2008, there used to be a school here.  Hiwada covers less than half the mountain, though.  The rest of the Gifu's claim to Ontake-yama is in Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span>, which is still part of the Hida region.  In Gero, this is Osaka village <span class='ja'>小坂村</span>.</p><p>I don't know much about Nagano prefecture, but on that side of the mountain, within Nagano is Kiso village <span class='ja'>木曽村</span>.</p><p>From downtown Takayama, it took about an hour to drive to Hiwada.  And from the remnants of Hiwada's old elementary school ground, I could clearly see Ontake-yama.  This is north, north-east of the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7953_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7964_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The steam and exhaust from the eruption continued to escape into the sky.  Looking even closer, several helicopters circled the erupted peak.  They were still searching for survivors, and possibly evacuating the survivors remaining at the summit.</p><p>So, I wondered how close I could get to this disaster, and if I was able to collect my jug of ash.</p><p>From Hiwada, I continued driving and entered Nagano prefecture in Kiso village.  This beautiful scenic route offered plenty of opportunities to stop along the road, and take some photos of the beautiful, yet currently dangerous mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7972_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_7998_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The turnoff for the Ontake gondolas was in a small farming area of Kiso village.  This was almost directly north-east of the mountain.  From here, you could begin to see the extent of just how much ash covered the mountain.  The north side of the mountain was relatively ash-free.  The south-side was almost totally covered.</p><p>At this point, I was about 7 kilometers away from the eruption.  In this farming area, there were no signs of ash on the ground.  Everything looked pretty normal.</p><p>I continued south towards the gondola entrance.  The roads became a little bit more gray, and I began to realize there was a thin layer of ash almost everywhere.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8009.webp" /></p><p>Most of it has been cleaned up by the street sweepers, though.  Some fire trucks and emergency vehicles drove by as I took photos on the side of the road.</p><p>Traveling just a little bit further, I came to the gondola entrance, which was blocked by emergency vehicles.  There were many other gawkers there as well.  Their cameras lined the shoulder of the road, snapping photos of the peak.  This was directly east of the peak.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8020.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8020.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8020.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016a.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016a.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8016a.webp" /></p><p>From here, I had a full view of the eruption.  Additionally, looking further, I could clearly see the summit building.  It was almost totally buried in ash.  Helicopters continued to search overhead looking for survivors.  I did not notice if the helicopters were actually evacuating people, though.</p><p>I wanted to get slightly closer, so I could collect some ash.  The emergency vehicles prevented people from gaining access.  I looked on the map for alternatives.  Down the road a bit further was a farm that had an access road to the gondolas.  I drove there, but it was blocked by fire trucks.  D'oh.  I drove back north, and went down another side road.  Again blocked.</p><p>But, in this side road area were many plants that had collected some ash on their leaves.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8038_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was able to grab these plants and brush off the ash <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8044.webp">into my jug</a>.  From this, I was able to collect about <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8046.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8046.webp">100 grams of ash</a>.  Not a lot, but it's better than nothing.  I collected ash for about 20 minutes, then decided to continue.</p><p>There were a few more turnoffs that lead to the mountain, so I drove down these roads to see what was there.  The next area I went to was some kind of cabin camping area for rich people named <span class='ja'>やまゆり荘</span>.  Within this neighborhood was a miniature golf course, a swimming pool, and some tennis courts.  This was about 5 or 6 kilometers from the eruption.</p><p>And these tennis court were the perfect receptacle for collecting volcanic ash.  There were a large wide open space, presently untouched by nature or man.  The ash from the eruption had not been cleaned or blown away.</p><p>Nearby were broom to clean the court.  I grabbed one, and swept up a bunch of ash into a pile.  Then, I put it all into my jug.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8055.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8061.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8061.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8061.webp" /></p><p>Success!  A jug of volcanic ash.  Nearby was a sink and running water, so I was able to clean my hands.</p><p>I continued driving around the neighborhood, looking for a trail entrance, or some other way of getting closer to the mountain.  It's somewhat hard to see, but this whole area had a light layer of ash covering everything.  The street sweepers did not yet have a chance to clean the roads.  As I drove down these roads, my car kicked up some clouds of ash, which made my car a bit dirty, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8081_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8082.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8082.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8082.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8088.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8088.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8088.webp" /></p><p>I wrapped around the neighborhood, and came across a trail entrance.  Every road leading to the mountain had signs like the one above.</p><p><span class='ja'>御嶽山噴火により</span> - Due to the eruption of Mt. Ontake.<br/><span class='ja'>入山禁止</span> - Entrance is prohibited.</p><p>Eh, I drove up this road anyways to see what was there.  When I reached the trail entrance, there were police waiting.  A single cop car was perched on the road making sure no one continued along.  The two policemen approached my car, and told me that entrance was prohibited, and I should leave.  So, I turned around and went back.</p><p>The emergency teams of Kiso village were pretty thorough.  If even this tiny little entrance had a patrol, I was most likely not going to find anyway else to gain access to the mountain.  And really, I already got my jug of ash, and enough photos.  I didn't need to proceed any further.</p><p>I went back to the farms, then took to the road returning to Hiwada.  It was around 1pm now.  With the afternoon sun directly above, the air became a bit hazy, and more difficult to get decent shots.</p><p>The mountain continued to erupt.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140928_ontake/IMG_8134_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I arrived in Hiwada, and decided to go to the Ciao ski resort to take a look of the mountain from that side.  Given the direction of the wind in the Kita Alps, Gifu is most untouched from the eruption.  The wind has blown all the ash and debris into Nagano.</p><p>The Ciao ski resort is directly north of the mountain peaks.

There were no police or emergency vehicles.  It felt like this whole eruption, despite being on joint Gifu and Nagano land, was really only being handled by Nagano.  I guess that makes sense, though, since that's the direction of the fallout.</p><p>I went up to the resort a little bit and looked around.  I noticed some hikers returning from the hills.  I think they were there for the same reason I was.</p><div class='title'><b>Safety</b></div><p>Anyway, Takayama is totally safe from the eruption of Ontake.  Even Hiwada, the closest area of Takayama, seemed unaffected by the blast, and fallout.  Hiwada didn't even have any ash.  They probably didn't even feel anything.</p><p>Kiso village in Nagano seemed hit the most by the disaster, as well as the visiting hikers, some of whom lost their lives.  I think at this point, there are still 30 hikers missing, most likely buried in ash somewhere near the peak of the mountain.  I hope rescue workers are able to recover them before they die. :(<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Akigami Elementary 秋神小学校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/akigami-elementary-school">Akigami Elementary 秋神小学校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And as the sun set, the sky continued to stay completely clear, void of clouds.  As Summer continues to wane, and Fall becomes the official season, I think there will be more and more days like this.</p><p>This was the first night in a very long time without any cloud cover.  There was no moon, either.  It was 11pm, so I decided to look up how to take night images with my camera, and then I tested it from my apartment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Holy crap, this actually worked.  A little bit, anyway.  There was a spot on my lens.  Plus, I needed to cut out almost all the darkness from the levels, and crank the brightness a little bit.  But, I could see quite a bit of stars. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Into the Dark</b></div><p>Obviously the best places to take starry photos are from really really dark places.  Living in the mountains is perfect for this opportunity because there is very little light pollution.  Takayama is small, but it's still the biggest city around here, and gives off some light pollution.  I wanted to test my camera a little further.  So, I hopped in my car, and drove to <b>Nyuukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span></b>.</p><p>Nyuukawa Village probably has about 4000 people.  It's mostly mountains and forested wilderness, but the area nearest Takayama has some wide open farmland.  I drove west from central Nyuukawa until I came across what looked like an open space.  I think I actually parked in some guy's driveway.</p><p>I could see everything.  I could see the Milky Way galaxy, and the millions and millions of stars throughout the entire night sky.  It was..  huge.  Sure, it was faint.  But being engulfed in most darkness allows the eyes to adjust.  </p><p>I laid down on the ground, and looked up at the starry sky.  A bizarre feeling of dizziness came over me.  Like I was going to fall over, but I was already lying down.  I guess that's vertigo, right?  The vastness of space was laid out before me.  The near infinite landscape of the cosmos.  I saw a shooting star, too!</p><p>Anyway, I set up my camera, and took some photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They turned out way more clear than the ones I took from my apartment.  Unfortunately, the scene was simply to vast, and my camera is not sensitive enough to capture everything.</p><p>It was able to capture some interesting things, though.

It's pretty amazing that my camera is able to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification">the temperature</a> of the stars. </p><p>About 20 minutes into my time taking photos, an airplane passed by overhead, so I tried to taking photos of that.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7487.webp" /></p><p>All in all, I spent about 45 minutes in this guy's driveway taking photos of the night sky, and the surrounding area.

The old streets and sake breweries in the heart of the city, and being completely surrounded by mountains and nature convey these old feelings.  There really isn't another place like it.</p><p>Before it was created in this image, Takayama was the site of a few battles.  In the 1500s, some dude named Yoritsuna seized the Hida province and built the Matsukura castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span> to defend it.  Some decades later, Kanamori <span class='ja'>金森</span> was ordered to attack Yoritsuna and capture Hida, who then ruled the Echizen Ono Castle <span class='ja'>越前大野城</span>, which you might remember as the 3rd castle on my <a href="/old/v7/20-castle-stamp-rally" title="/20-castle-stamp-rally">20 Castle Stamp Rally Card</a>.  </p><p>Kanamori battled and defeated Yoritsuna in 1585, and became the ruler of Hida.  Matsukura Castle was a warrior's castle, though.  It was built for battling and defending, but this is not what Kanamori and his clan wanted for Takayama.  In 1588, Kanamori began construction of the Takayama Castle <span class='ja'>高山城</span>, and basically created Takayama in the image of a castle town.  He's basically the founder of modern day Takayama, and you can find all kinds of info and artifacts about Kanamori in the Takayama Museum of History and Art.  After his capture of Takayama, it basically became a peaceful place.</p><p>Matsukura Castle was abandoned, and eventually destroyed somehow.  The rules of this castle (and the Takayama Castle) are still present today.  Though, the Takayama Castle ruins aren't nearly as interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>The site of the Matsukura Castle is located near current Matsukura Junior High School <span class='ja'>松倉中</span>, on the southwest corner of the heart of Takayama City.  This time I actually went hiking with a friend. :)  After lunch, we began around 2pm.</p><p>To get to the ruins, drive up the hill past Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨の里</span>, and you'll find a plateau where you can park.  From there, you will find a path that leads up into the forest.  It takes about 10 minutes if you're driving from Takayama Station.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" /></p><p>The path is only 250 meters, and it takes about 5 or 10 minutes to hike through the slightly rocky terrain.  Being in such close proximity to the city allows the trails to be easily well kept, and well traveled..  There were really no traces of any large animals along the trail, either.  But there were plenty of mushrooms.</p><p>Heavier rocks are embedded in the trail as we continued, and then came across a partially collapsed edge of a castle wall.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" /></p><p>The trails leads past the wall, and around the main wall of the castle ruins.  There were trees and grass, but the area was still very rocky.

Just a few quick steps to climb, and we had a much more wide open view of lower Takayama, and the Enako neighborhood <span class='ja'>江名子町</span>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the above photo..  On the bottom of the photo is lower Takayama, where Hie Junior High School <span class='ja'>日枝中</span> and Sanno Elementary School <span class='ja'>三王小</span> are prominent and clearly visible.  The area above that is the Enako neighborhood <span class='ja'>江名子町</span>, which has Enako Elementary <span class='ja'>江名子小</span>.  That school is probably visible in there somewhere.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are plenty of trees on this mountain which obstructed the full view of Takayama City.  It was still possible to see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6689.webp">Nakayama Junior High School <span class='ja'>中山中</span></a>, and the Mieda area in the north.  Further west, you could see some of the Shingu area, but it was almost all obstructed by trees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" /></p><p>It would really help if this summit had a platform that went up another 10 meters.  You could see over the trees, and completely view Takayama.  Maybe they can't build one, though.  I think this site is protected under some historical preservation law.</p><p>Overall, the castle ruins were interesting, but having the view obstructed kinda blows the full experience of the castle.  My friend was reminded a haiku poem that mentions the history one can feel in such a place.  More than 400 years ago, hundreds of warriors and soldiers lost their lives in battle defending this castle, and their souls linger and shape the life growing on this mountain.</p><div class='title'><b>Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span></b></div><p>The Matsukura Castle ruins was only the first thing on my list of things to do in this area.  We went back to the parking area, got some water, and took a look at the area map.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" /></p><p>Our next destination was the summit of Harayama, or Mt. Hara, which was only another kilometer away by hiking.  The whole area was a loop, but we already did most of the heavy climbing in my car.</p><p>We continued into the forest going the opposite direction of Matsukura Castle to reach the summit, and the trail was quite a bit more rough.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" /></p><p>Some areas were covered with some heavy rocks erupting from the ground.  Other areas slightly covered with foliage.  At some point, there was even a climbing rope provided to help us walk up a 40/45 degree incline.  The map indicated this was a walking path, but as my friend continued to mention, this wasn't really walking at all.  It was hiking.</p><p>I took some pictures, but we continued to press on.  We were supposed to come across some kind of house marked on the map, but we didn't see anything.  After traveling a full kilometer we reached a fork in the road and a sign that said we reached the walking path we thought we were on.  Apparently we took some kind of rough shortcut.  Bleh, whatever.</p><p>100 meters ahead was the summit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From here you could clearly see the entire Shingu neighborhood <span class='ja'>新宮町</span>, downtown Takayama, a little bit of Nyukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span>, and off in the west you could see one of the prominent neighborhoods in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6753.webp">Kiyomi <span class='ja'>清見</span></a>.</p><p>You could clearly see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6754.webp">Shingu Elementary <span class='ja'>新宮小</span></a>, which was in the middle of their Sports Festival. :D  We could even hear the announcements from the summit, too.

It gets really cold at night, which brings in all these clouds, and fog.  In the morning, it's overcast, and gloomy.  Throughout the morning, it's still overcast, but the clouds begin to break apart with the increasing temperature.  Eventually the sky opens up in mid-day.  Then gets covered up again as the sun sets.</p><p>The tallest looking mountain in the whole view was <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6785.webp">Ibuseyama <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span></a>, which I visited a few weeks ago: <a href="/old/v7/ibuseyama" title="/ibuseyama">September 3rd</a>.</p><p>We took in the view for a while, then made our way back to the car.

Every year on August 9th and 10th, a festival is held to pray and celebrate good health and a good upcoming harvest as fall approached.  Over those two days, members of the temple create those infamous Hida horse paintings for the townspeople and anyone willing to make the hike to their temple.  The artists work nonstop from the 9th to the 10th creating these painting and celebrating good fortune.
