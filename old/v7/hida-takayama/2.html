The existing building, and only actual constructed building, was to be one part of a resort area including a gold course, ski resort, archery courses, rental villas, a hotel, boating pond, an amusement park, limestone cave viewing, and more. So many hopes and dreams that had ultimately failed before the first phase had even been completed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Let's begin with the end of World War II. During the war, many ordinary Japanese citizens moved away from large cities as Americans targetted them for bombing. The Hida region was a convenient area away from Nagoya and Gifu cities in the south and Toyama in the north. As the war ended, Japan surrended, and with the newly established government from the US, people began moving back to the cities to rebuild and find work.</p><p>This was the beginning of the rural depopulation for Hida, and the depopulation became exponential in the 60s when Japanese industry started to become a worldwide innovator, especially with TVs and cars.</p><p>The area known as Nikoi Kougen used to be a small village called Nikoi-Daira with a couple of homes and a school. The school was a branch school of Tanekura Elementary School. Tanekura is the village/neighborhood west of the area along the river in the valley. Many of these really remote areas used to be mining or logging settlements. A village would build up around the logging location, the workers would have children, and then it would be too difficult for their kids to travel during winter to get to the main school. A branch school was then set up so teachers of the nearby school could travel up the mountain, stay there for a few days, and teach the kids. I talk about this a lot in the <a href="https://theschlock.com/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools" title="https://theschlock.com/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools">Kiyomi School History</a> post.</p><p>The branch school was opened in 1952 to accomodate students. It then closed in 1962 probably because the settlement had folded. It could have folded from the logging company ceasing operations there, or because people wanted to live closer to their families, or because of increased technology, more powerful cars and trucks could go up there on their own in winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6206_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1972, a construction company from Nagoya had purchased the land as part of an initiative in Japan to stop the depopulation of rural areas. The plan was to build those amusement areas mentioned above. Construction began in 1974. The first phase was to be concluded by the end of 1975, but the company went bankrupt in summer, partly due to the cost of building this resort area.</p><p>The only building that was completed was this triangular building, the resort's restaurant. It's grand opening was planned in Nov 1972, but that didn't happen. Apparently, there's records of a pre-opening event being held there, which meant that the building had been fully completed. Next to the triangular restaurant is a concrete foundation of another building that did not advance further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6651_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Credit to most of this information goes to <a href="https://haikyo.info/s/8102.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/8102.html">haikyo.info</a>. I came across this site a few weeks ago trying to find information about another haikyo site that I visited several years ago. </p><p>After a busy couple of weeks, I finally found some time to go up there. Monday of Golden Week had the best weather, so I left my house around 7:30am. I tried visiting the prior weekend, but the roads had been blocked. I went to the <a href="/old/v7/miyagawa-archaeological-museum" title="/miyagawa-archaeological-museum">Miyagawa Archaeological Museum</a> instead, and the museum guide said that it would be fine to walk there. So, whether the roads were open or not, I had planned to walk.</p><p>Sure enough, the road was still closed. But, it was a only 3.5ish-kilometer hike on a paved surface. Easy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6160_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Only 500 meters into the hike showed that it would actually be impossible to use this road to drive there. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6190.webp">A landslide</a> had completely covered the road, taking a tree with it. Throughout the trek, several other trees had fallen on the road, blocking the path. Not difficult to walk through, but not possible with a car.</p><p>A couple of forest friends also showed up on the hike. I saw a few lizards, and I also met two mountain goats.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6199_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Japanese Serow, a treasure of the forest. They are completely harmless and are considered a symbol of life in the forest. By the mid-50s, there were apparently hunted to near extinction, and a law was passed making them illegal to hunt. Since then, their numbers have skyrocketed to the point where they are no longer threatened. Sometimes they cause some problems for farmers, though, so the law was appealed in 1979 allowed farmers to cull their numbers in certain situations.</p><p>It only took about 50 minutes to cover the 3km stretch of mountain road to reach the front gate of the resort. Going past the gate and derelict pond and fountain, the road was now more open. And appearing through the woods, was the resturant of the Nikoi-Kougen Resort.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6253_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The building still stands after all this time thanks to its steel beams, concrete foundation, and aluminum (I assume) roofing. Many buildings from around this time has a similar metal roofing, and depending on the amount of snow in winter, the weight could bend and warp the roof, like what has happened with this restaurant.</p><p>The restaurant is in an odd orientation. The entrance faces towards north in the direction of the road, but the road never meets it. The road and restaurant are separated by a stream cutting through the area. The road goes past the restaurant and a small bridge connects the road to the back of the restaurant.</p><p>I'm not sure how patrons were supposed to access the entrance of the restaurant. Maybe there were supposed to be more bridges and walking paths along the opposite side of the river.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6281_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p> The triangle side of the building was meant to be fully glassed, giving everyone an open view of the nature outside. Now, all that glass is gone, and this half of the building is completely exposed. This area was one of many dining areas.</p><p>The above photo is the dining area pushed back from the entrance. Maybe it could be sectioned off as a closed room for a party of guests? The door in the wall leads to the kitchen. This section also opens up in the main open area where small tables were probably set. You could look up at the second floor dining area from here.</p><p class='img'> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6287_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p> After this, I went through the collapsing archway into a tiled room in the center of the building. This must've been the kitchen. Various pipes came up from the concrete floor. Maybe these were draining pipes for sinks?  There were more pipes on the walls. Looking at the wooden hoods above those areas, those were probably gas pipes for cooking ranges and stoves.</p><p> Several tiles has broken away from the wall, but many of them were still stronger affixed to the wall. Pretty good for a 50-year-old building no one maintained.</p><p class='img'> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The door in the back leads to a hallway with a series of rooms. The hallway has a door at the end that goes outside, so this is probably how they would bring in deliveries to stock their refrigerators. There's a square room which also has a door in the back of the building. This was probably the staff room, or maybe an office. There's a staff bathroom back here, too. </p><p>There's also the boiler room for water pressure, electricty, and heat. An electric panel was present that showed all the amps powering the freezer storage room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6375_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The two other doorways of the kitchen led to another dining area. In the back of the room was a wooden frame on the floor. I was thinking that it could've been a bar, but it was probably a tatami floor. On the ground, there was several decades-old beer bottles and cans from other people exploring the ruins in years past.</p><p>The plastic tiling on the ground had split at its seams and began curling up. Other old work equipment and gear laid on the floor, decaying with the rest of the building.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's not a very big building and the only place left to explore was the second floor dining area.</p><p>When exploring ruins, you have to be careful of a lot of different things. Depending on how decayed the building is, parts of the building could collapse when you walk on it. Exposed nails, wires, and glass could cut, puncture, and result in infection. There's also the danger of inhaling asbestos, mold, or any other toxic material used in the construction of older buildings that could now be exposed from the buildings decay.</p><p>Going up to the second floor increases the likelihood of something bad happening. I could fall through the floor. Or accidentally grab something harmful to keep my balance from falling.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6405_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The upper floor was pretty small, though. And with the triangle roof gone and being completely exposed to nature, plants had begun to grow from the floor. I didn't see any roots of these plants from below, so the floor must've been pretty thick. Even so, I still stayed towards the edge of the room, next to the walls where support was the strongest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6418_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inner wall of the room had completely decayed, so you could you see the suspended roof of the kitchen, the back rooms, and other dining rooms. There was an electrical outlet on the wall, but it's wires had been cut. There was also a dumbwaiter that connected to the one below next to the kitchen. That makes sense as the staircase was too narrow for anyone to carry food.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6452_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first floor main dining area was very simliar to the second floor. With the roof gone, dirt had been blown in or carried by snow. And from that, plants had begun to grow.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6507_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The roof covering the rest of the building had been severely warped. Almost all of the wooden supports that had suspended the metal roof had become brittle, rotted away, and broken. Having to carry the weight of 50 years worth of blizzards resulting in meters and meters of snow and ice, the roof had been molded into its current melted-looking shape. Actually, many abandoned homes in the nearby village had similar looking roofs.</p><p>Even in May, there was still large piles of heavy snow turned to ice. They probably should've given the building more clearance from the hill. The windows on that side of the building were probably the first to shatter from the pressure of snow and ice. I suppose a building company from Nagoya wouldn't know that, though.</p><p>I walked through the building again, and then ventured out back.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6547_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's the office from the outside.</p><p>Around the back was a water reservoir, so the building could have clean water.

I don't think its been publically stated what this was supposed to be. It's pretty small for a hotel, so maybe it was living quarters for the staff? Or maybe it was a souvenir store?</p><p>After looking around at the foundation, I had seen everything I needed to.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6658_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I left the area from the front of the building on the opposite side of the river as the road. This is where guests would have been coming and going. But there was nothing over here. The open area of the land just led to the river. Maybe they planned on making a bridge? The stream/river was a little wider than I had planned on, but a tree had fallen across, so I balanced my way across back to the road.</p><p>I left the area the same way I had arrived.</p><div class='title'><b>Nikoi Waterfall</b></div><p>There was one other feature of the Nikoi Resort that had some infrastructure. About 1km down the road, there was a waterfall with a walkway to view it from.</p><p>On the road, you could easily hear the waterfall and see its top. But finding the trailhead leading to the walkway was not so easy. It was much further down the road than you'd think. Also, there were no signs or labels. The entrance just seemed like every other curve in the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I eventually found it, though. Several beams of the railing had rusted through and collapsed. The walkway also seemed to move a little bit when I stepped on it. But, overall, it felt safe. It did not feel like it was going to collapse.</p><p>After going across a few of these walkways, the final one went across a gap that gave the perfect image of the Nikoi Waterfall.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6733_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yep, that's a waterfall.</p><p>There was a tunnel at the end of the walkway. Apparently this led to a limestone cave? Or led to something interesting along a cliff? The sign it was only 134 meters long, but I couldn't see any light in the tunnel at all. Even after going about 10 meters into the tunnel, the ceiling was getting shorter and it looked like the tunnel had collapsed. F that, I'm outta here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250505_nikoi/IMG_6789_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I took a few more waterfall photos, but I went back to the road and then back to my car. The whole hike took about 3 hours.</p><p>Along part of the road, I was able to see the hydroelectric facilities at the base of the mountain, near where I parked. But, I was not able to see any of the road when I was back at my car. I took a few photos of what looked like a corner mirror sign, but on later inspection, couldn't find it.</p><p>Overall, I'm not really sure how the development company planned on making money from the Nikoi project. It's a nice area, but way too remote for anyone remotely rich to want to come up here regularly. The company probably saw the success of other areas in Nagano and thought they could do it here. But, nope. And they went bankrupt before even getting anywhere.</p><p>Now it's just another rotting relic of Japan's rich past.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline of the Hike</b></div><table>    <tr><td>7:30ish</td><td></td><td>Left Home</td></tr>    <tr><td>8:20am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parked</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116">36°21'14.5"N 137°12'41.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>9:10am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Front Gate of Resort</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3558944,137.2239177" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3558944,137.2239177">36°21'21.3"N 137°13'26.2"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>9:15am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Building</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3534236,137.2283197" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3534236,137.2283197">36°21'12.3"N 137°13'42.0"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Left Building</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Waterfall Trail Head</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3538455,137.2179628" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3538455,137.2179628">36°21'13.9"N 137°13'04.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:35am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Nikoi Waterfall</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3532169,137.2200632" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3532169,137.2200632">36°21'11.6"N 137°13'12.3"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Left Waterfall Area</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3540117,137.2116">36°21'14.5"N 137°12'41.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/>    <br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Miyagawa Archaeological Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/miyagawa-archaeological-museum">Miyagawa Archaeological Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is a collection of artifacts from the history of the village, including pottery and tools from ancient times, clothes and farm equipment from the Edo period, and items from the Meiji and Showa periods.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6103_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, less than 1000 people live in the village. Although, that number is difficult to determine because the village is just one part of Hida City. The totality of Hida City has a population of around 26,000, but the majority of its residents live in Furukawa and Kamioka.</p><p>Hida City was officially incorporated in 2004 as a merger of Furukawa, Kamioka, Kawai Village, and Miyagawa Village. Prior to the merger, the population of Miyagawa Village was 1140. Being a single municipality, the junior high and elementary schools were able to consolidate and merge as well.</p><p>I call the museum impressive because Miyagawa is not very big, yet this museum has thousands of artifacts collected throughout the history of the village. In the main hall, over 16,000 materials are on display from the Edo, Meiji, and Showa periods.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5783_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first floor of the main hall is dedicated to items of the <b>Edo period</b>. The bulk of the collection is farming and carpentry equipment, but there is also a huge assortment of items used for surviving the harsh mountain winters. Snow removal and travel is of the most importance in the winter, as is winter clothing for inside and outside of the house.</p><p>You can see the daily clothing of the people in warmer weather, too. They also had a few horse saddles, which did not look comfortable for either the horse nor the rider.</p><p>All these items had been tagged with the general year they were used and the location and family they were from, if that information was available.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5878_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the back, a hallway led to an annexing building that focused on archaelogical digs of the Miyagawa region. Many decorative pots had been reconstructed from their excavations, and believed to be from some time between the Paleolithic and Jomon periods of Japanese history. (14,000 years ago to 2500).</p><p>In total, there are 1842 items on display, and perhaps more in the research rooms that are closed to the public.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6063_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The most interesting part of the museum to me was the second floor collection of items in the main hall from the <b>Showa and Meiji Periods</b>. The Edo Period is obviously interesting, but I really like the Showa period as it bridges the gap between those old times and today. It's the building blocks of today's society.</p><p>There were some items from war, but the most interesting stuff was their massive collection of school items, especially their collection of elementary school diplomas from the last 150 years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6031_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As mentioned above, Miyagawa Village <span class='ja'>宮川村</span> is now just a neighborhood of Hida City having merged together in 2004. But, Miyagawa Village itself was a merger of two other smaller villages, established in 1956. It was the merger of Sakagami <span class='ja'>坂上</span> and Sakashita <span class='ja'>坂下</span> Villages. At the time, Sakagami Village had a population of 2400, and Sakashita had a population of about 1400. Again, today, Miyagawa has less than 1000 people, so they've lost 75% of their population over 75 years.</p><p>Going back even further in history, both Sakagami and Sakashita villages were also mergers in 1875, which was Meiji <span class='ja'>明治</span>8<span class='ja'>年</span>, in Japanese years. The merger was part of the overall Meiji restoration of Japan.</p><p>From this merger, 4 elementary schools and 4 junior high schools were established for Sakagami <span class='ja'>坂上</span>, Sakashita <span class='ja'>坂下</span>, Omukari <span class='ja'>大無雁</span>, and Tanekura <span class='ja'>種蔵</span>. Later, the Omukari and Tanekura junior high schools were merged into Sakagami Junior High.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6027_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, the oldest diploma (that I was able to read) in the case was from Meiji <span class='ja'>明治</span>12<span class='ja'>年</span>, which was 1879. The diploma was presented to Matsunosuke Maruyama <span class='ja'>丸山松之助</span> for completing 10 years and 1 month of school. (There was another diploma next to it for 10 yeras 7 months for the same person.)</p><p>The diploma was issued by Sakagami Elementary School, but, again, being so early in the Meiji restoration, the location had a different name and even the kanji are now outdated by today's standards. It reads <span class='ja'>岐阜縣管下吉城郡坂上村坂上小學校</span>, or Gifu Prefecture Jurisdiction Yoshiki Distirct Sakagami Village Sakagami Elementary School. It wouldn't be until the incorporation of Hida City that Yoshiki District would be abolished.</p><p>I find the kanji really interesting. Gifu Prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜縣</span> is now written as <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span> these days. And school <span class='ja'>學校</span> is now written as <span class='ja'>学校</span>. As part of the Post World War II government, many kanji were simplified.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6025_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's a diploma from Sakagami Elementary again from <span class='ja'>明治</span>16<span class='ja'>年</span> or 1883. This is to another student of the Maruyama family, probably Matsunosuke's younger brother or sister. The official title of the school changed to <span class='ja'>岐阜縣飛騨國吉城郡坂上村公立坂上小學校</span> or Gifu Precture Hida Province Yoshiki Distinct Sakagami Village Public Sakagami Elementary School. Hida Province and Public were added to the title. This person completed 9 years 6 months of elementary school.</p><p>9 or 10 years of elementary school certainly seems like a long time. It wasn't until 1886 that Junior High schools existed in Japan, so prior to that time, the term "elementary" school was generally used to describe all public primary schooling. Anyone who wanted to be a teacher or some kind of scholar would move away and attend a high school. Also in 1886, "normal" schools were established, which focused education on a specific field of study.</p><p>Anyways, I stared at the diplomas for a while looking at the dates and marveling at how documents from over 100 years ago were still preserved so well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6036_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Opposite of the diploma display case were items used for these schools. One of the catalogued items on display was the sign board for Sakashita Junior High School. Several photos of classes were pinned to the wall besides it. One photo was of their school trip to Kyoto in 1952. Below was their school manual, and a few textbooks.</p><p>The case next to the diplomas was filled was textbooks of the same time period.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_5942_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, this museum was pretty incredible. I didn't know this at the time, but because the museum is so big and Miyagawa village is so small, they can't staff the museum all year round. The museum is only open 30 days a year because of that. It's open 3 weeks around Golden Week, during Obon, and a few more weekends in September, October, and November. So, I was pretty lucky to stumble into the museum on a day it was fully open.</p><p>I talked with the old man staffing the museum about some of the items and where the old schools were located.</p><p>The main area of Sakagami Village is now the downtown area of Miyagawa Village, which is where Miyagawa Elementary school is today. Miyagawa Elementary School was established in 2000, and these days only has 7 students.</p><p>But, this is not the same location of Sakagami Elementary School. The old man mentioned that even though that old school had been torn down, the gym of Sakagami Elementary was still in town and in use today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6117_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty easy to find. It's just down the street from Sakagami Station in the heart of Miyagawa. The building still looks really nice considering it was built 150 years ago. In place of the old elementary school, was some kind of temple. It's called the <span class='ja'>世界聖誠会</span>, which Google translates as the World Society of the Holy Spirit. The temple is connected to the gym now, so they use it for something.</p><p>I wanted to take a look inside, but everything was closed and all the shades were drawn. And going around knocking on doors didn't seem like a good idea.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250426_miyagawa/IMG_6113_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Downtown Miyagawa had another relic, the Sakagami Village Post Office. Even the title <span class='ja'>坂上郵便局</span> has its shadow still left on the side of the building. The doors were locked, but I could see inside through the windows. It seemed full of garbage, like old bicycles, wood panels, and other things. Maybe it was once used as storage for festival equipment, but nothing inside seemed useful.</p><p>The Sakagami Train Station looked pretty nice and modern. Maybe this was an effort of Hida City to try and get people to visit, but the whole place was deserted. Eventually an old man, possibly drunk, stumbled out of a nearby home to stare at me and figure out why I was snooping around. Eh, I was done here anyway.</p><p>The Miyagawa Archaelogical Museum is pretty special. And it's interesting how the museum itself seems to be a relic of the past when Japan had more time, money, and people to put it together. I wonder what other unique museums can be found up here in the mountains.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kitayama in Late Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kitayama-late-winter">Kitayama in Late Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

With prime real estate on the platea of Kitayama, it gave an amazing view. But now, Kankou Hotel has been completely demolished and the site is nothing but a flat dirt area. COVID was perhaps the final nail in the coffin for the Kankou Hotel. It was probably already struggling from the competition of other newer hotels in Takayama. </p><p>Over the last 10 years, tourism in Takayama has exploded, and with the massive income, new hotels have been built in areas next to the station. Kankou Hotel was so far out of the way, nobody would realistically walk there from the station. They did have shuttle busses, but even then, if someone staying at the Kankou Hotel wanted to walk around Takayama, they'd have to go down the mountain and then go back up when returning. It's so much easier for people to just stay in a hotel at street level.</p><p>And then COVID happened and foreign tourism was completely halted. To make up some of the lost revenue, the Kankou Hotel used its rooms for people infected with COVID during the lockdown. Local people called it the "COVID jail," and its reputation for being a terrible place grew from there, in addition to whatever cleanup the hotel had to do from its infected guests.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It sucks that such a prominent hotel in the area is now gone, but it's the nature of business.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kumano Shrine 熊野神社 &amp; Akahogi Park 赤保木公園" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter">Kumano Shrine 熊野神社 &amp; Akahogi Park 赤保木公園</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Takayama is surrounded by nature, forests, and mountains. All of these mountains shield us from the wind, so when it snows, it comes gently and fluffy, and piles up and up without getting blown over. This creates a beautiful frosted landscape.</p><p>With the constant snow, I wanted to go out and take some photos, and being test week, I had an afternoon available to do some exploring in the snow. There's a shrine at the edge of town nestled into the forest that I thought would be perfect to visit. This is Kumano Shrine.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumano Shrine <span class='ja'>熊野神社</span></b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The gate to the shrine is on the literal edge of the forest meeting the open fields. I parked near the side entrance, but then took the long route back down the road and back through the fields to meet this entrance.</p><p>We received about 1 meter of snow over the past couple of days on top of the snow we already had. The fields and paths to arrive to the gate were pretty deep, but the natural canopy of the forest shielded most of the rest of the path leading to the Shrine.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This presented a different problem, though. As the hardened tufts of snow in the tall trees got heavier, the branch eventually gave way to drop the snow, whiting out the path forward. The clumps of snow hitting the snow on the ground created the only sound available. A small gust of wind would rustle the branches, and then soft bum, bum, bums would follow, along with me curling up, protecting the camera, and facing away from the snow coming into my face.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was not difficult to climb the steps and reach the shrine.</p><p>The Kumano Shrine was officially recognized and protected by the city starting from July 10th, 1975. It is believed to be built around the year 1680. This was almost 100 years after Kanamori conquered the Hida area, and established it as a mountain oasis for his rich friends. Much of this wealth did trickle down improved the area, too.</p><p>The shrine was built by artist Ikemori Gengo <span class='ja'>池守源五</span> and funded by lacquerware artist Narita Sankyu <span class='ja'>成田三休</span>. Its style was totally fitting of other tradition buildings at the time, and the reliefs were made in the Shunkei lacquerware style, also notable in Hida.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367_t.webp" /></a></p><p>According to the Internet, the main hall is the oldest original one still standing in Takayama. There was a hole punctured in the screen of the front door, so I could stick my camera lens through it. The shrine is still used today for Shinto ceremonies in the summer, like all shrines around town.</p><p>Being satisfied with my current stack of photos, I did not break in or walk around the back for more. I continued back to my car using the side entrance, while occasionally getting pelted by falling clumps of snow.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Akahogi Park <span class='ja'>赤保木公園</span></b></div><p>Before actually leaving, I remembered there was a small park behind the forest with the shrine. The shrine itself wasn't really deep in the forest. It was in a small pennisula of woods shooting out from the beginnings of the main western forest heading up to Mihakayama <span class='ja'>見量山</span>. I went hiking up there before <a href="/old/v7/mihakayama" title="/mihakayama">in 2016</a>.</p><p>I decided to take a look at the park real quick. Why not?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The park is an open area, but has a small preserved village next to it. This is the Akahogi Preservation Site, and the main thing it is perserving is a stone age wood furnace. It was discovered in 1954. Later in the 90s, archeologists and members of the historical society began restoring the area to capture the atmosphere of ancient Hida.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The most distinct buildings of ancient Hida are the Gasho-zukuri <span class='ja'>合掌造り</span>. They are mostly small wooden huts, although they can grow in size. They are very distinct because of their massive heavy thatched roofs which withstand the massive weight of Hida snowfalls. In the middle of the these homes, are fires that warm the whole interior.</p><p>There are a few open air museums in the area that have transported many of these buildings into their own town. In Takayama, <a href="/old/v7/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato" title="/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato">Hida no Sato</a> <span class='ja'>飛騨の里</span> is most well known.</p><p>Within the Akahogi village, I did not travel too far. I only approached the closest building, which also seemed like the only one open.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was deep, but these buildings are built to last. Looking in from the outside, it was completely black. The blinding white of the snow made it difficult to see anything past the door. With all the bear signs around, I was a little bit cautious of a confrontation. But... eh. It's probably fine.</p><p>I jutted inside and was completely sheltered from the snow outside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe it was just my imagination, but it felt much warmer inside. Obviously, it offered complete protection of the wind, but it felt more than that. Maybe the straw of the roof retained or created some kind of heat.</p><p>In the middle, was the ancient fire pit, restored from the broken pieces found in the 50s. Nearby, a painted wooden plaque explained the purpose and usage of the fire pit. Obviously, it is pretty self explanatory to modern people, how the surrounding rocks can absorb and hold on the heat from the fire keeping the room warm. Also, how you can use the surface of the rocks to cook meat. The openings in the back and above the door allowed from the smoke the exit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, that was the end of my hike.

Photo Rogaining is a somewhat new sport that combines photography and running. It's like a photo scavenger hunt, except you are giving specific locations where to take the photos. The challenge is, by having no prior knowledge of the locations, you must quickly determine a route to reach as many checkpoints as possible, each checkpoint having different point values.</p><p>Prior to his message, I had no idea what this was. <span class='ja'>ロゲイニング</span>? I could not figure out the English word this was trying to be. Logging? Photo Logging? But, Photo Rogaining is the correct English. Rogaining as a sport began in Australia. Its first event was in the 70s. The name Rogaining comes from the 3 folks who invented it: Rod, Gail, and Neil. They just combined their names.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The full title of the event was <b>Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining - Celebrating the 500th Birthday of Nagachika Kanamori</b> -<span class='ja'>金森長近生誕</span>500<span class='ja'>年記念</span>- <span class='ja'>飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング</span>. Kanamori is a very special historical figure for the town. We have a statue of him in the Castle Park.</p><p>Head of the Kanamori Clan, Nagachika led his troops as an arm of the Tokugawa Clan and conquered northern Gifu and eventually Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui. Becoming the daimyo of the area, Kanamori transformed Takayama into a small-sized castle town to encourage tourism of other rich lords. He established what would become modern day Takayama. </p><p>So, the event commemorates the 500th anniversary of his birth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Takayama event was advertised around town a little bit. The starting point as well as the main venue was the Takayama City Historical Museum downtown. The poster had a link to the website for more information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/">https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/</a></p><p>There were 6 different categories of participants: Family Team, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team, Men's Solo, and Women's Solo. The event had a limit of 100 entrees, but we only had around 40 people total? A few didn't show up, but overall I don't think the event was advertised all that well. I'm really glad my friend sent me the info.</p><p>My friend joined a team with his daughter. There were 3 or 4 family teams. The biggest category was the Mixed Teams with 9 separate teams competing. The second biggest category was my category, Men's Solo. We had 6 individuals.</p><p>The schedule was as follows:<br/><b>11:00</b> - Reception<br/><b>12:00</b> - Start<br/><b>15:00</b> - Finish<br/><b>15:30</b> - Awards Ceremony</p><div class='title'><b>Rules</b></div><p>On the Japanese Photo Rogaining site, they listed some general rules. It was not exhaustive, so I didn't completely understand everything. Through the course of the event, I was able to understand the rules better, and now I have a much better grasp of what I could've done to place higher than I did.</p><p>Reception for the event was 11am at the museum. At check-in, we got our bib, number, and a packet with our map, which we were not allowed to open yet. Around 11:30am, they began explaining all the rules for the event. Again, I would've preferred they had all the rules clearly listed, so I could've double checked everything.</p><p>At 11:50am, 10 minutes prior to the start, we could open our maps and look at all of the objectives.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Several points on the map were ones I had guessed earlier, but I had no idea it would push out as far as <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kanon and Matsukura Castle ruins</a>. In reality, it's only 5 or 6km away. Normally isn't that far, but both of these are on the top of a mountain. Steep vertical ascents in a marathon are rough. On the other hand...  63 and 65 points are really high values, along with 43 and 47 on the way.</p><p>I didn't have a lot of time to think or compare this to the other points. I know that I wanted to climb up Shiroyama (castle park) for those points. So, my plan was to get some nearby points, go up Shiroyama for those points, and then push off west for Hida no Sato at least. On my return, I would keep north to grab all of those points before the end.</p><div class='title'><b>Start</b></div><p>As the event began, one of the Solo guys immediately bolted to the stoplight and then west. I kept up with him to the stoplight, but I was going east. </p><p>I grabbed a photo of the rock wall leading up the hill, <b>Point 1</b>, labeled as <span class='ja'>えび坂のお多福</span>. Further east, I snapped a photo of this small park, <b>Point 14</b>, <span class='ja'>川上別邸史跡公園</span>, Kawakami's Historical Second Home park?, on the way to the Bell Tower at Soyu-ji Temple, <b>Point 31</b>, <span class='ja'>宗猷寺鐘堂</span>.

Behind the shrine is a hiking path that goes directly up to Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span>. I'm not sure too many people knew about that. Way faster than taking the road. In the center of Shiroyama Park is the bronze statue of Kanamori, <b>Point 24</b>, <span class='ja'>長近銅像</span>. This is also where I parked my car. I dumped all my extra packet stuff in my car, and continued.</p><p>Before taking the path up to the Takayama Castle Ruins, I quickly ran over to the nearby Shoren-ji Temple <span class='ja'>照蓮寺</span>, <b>Point 18</b>. The path going up the mountain is pretty steep. Stair, after stair. It's not so bad if you're hiking normally, but in a race, it's rough.

People have these paintings created to bring luck and protection to a person's family or business through the upcoming year. This tradition began several hundred years ago, when farmers would bring their horses to the <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kannon Temple</a> <span class='ja'>松倉観音</span> on nearby Matsukura mountain to pray to Kannon for their protection. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /></p><p>The Matsukura Kannon Temple was first established in the 1690s by a Buddhist Monk named Tenden Koutou <span class='ja'>天電高幢</span>. Kannon is a Buddhist with six transformations, and the Matsukura Temple specifically worships Bato Kannon  <span class='ja'>馬頭観音</span>, the horse-headed transformation of Kannon. </p><p>Traditionally, the Hida region has been populated by farmers, so horses were a very important part of their lives. They were used in their farm work for cultivating their fields and transporting food to town. They were also needed to travel the long distance up north or down south. People considered them part of their family. As such, their stables were connected to their houses at the front door.</p><p>Each year on July 9th, people would bring their horses to the Matsukura Temple to have their horse blessed by the monks of Bato Kannon. 400 years ago, traveling up the Matsukura mountain to reach the temple was difficult, and horses were often injured. As the custom grew in popularity, it became even more troublesome to bring horses up the mountain.</p><p>Because of this, Emas <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> were created. Rather than bringing your physical horse up the mountain, you could buy a painting of your horse, have the monks bless the painting, and receive the same protection and fortune. People would hang the painting near their front door, near their horse's stable. Over time, these paintings have come to represent general good luck. As the horse faces inwards, it would bring you good luck to your home or business.</p><p>In <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">previous years</a>, I've gone up the Matsukura mountain to visit the Kannon Temple and get a horse painting. But, that's not the only place that makes these paintings.</p><div class='title'><b>Yamazakura Shrine <span class='ja'>山桜神社</span></b></div><p>Yamazakura Shrine is a small shrine on Honmachi street, one of the main streets in Takayama. It is squished between two restaurants. Despite being centrally located, it's perhaps more annoying to reach than the Kannon Temple on the mountain because there's no parking (for free) around the area. Although old people just park in the middle of the street anyway.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yamazakura Shrine is named after a local horse that became a legend. Yamazakura <span class='ja'>山桜</span> was born in the town of Nyukawa (NE town of Takayama) and became the horse of Kanamori Yorinao <span class='ja'>金森頼直</span>, the reigning ruler of Takayama at the time, great grandson of Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, who established modern Takayama. Yorinao was in Edo when the Great Fire of Edo happened in 1657. Yorinao was completely engulfed in flames in his guest house. The story goes that Yamazakura burst through the door allowing Yorinao to get on his back. The horse rushed out of the building and leaped into the river extinguishing the flames saving his life.</p><p>Yorinao was so grateful to his horse. He established the horse's stable in downtown Takayama on Honmachi street so the people of Takayama would look after him and treat him with respect. After Yamazakura's death, he was cremated and ashes spread at the foot of Mt. Matsukura on the path to the Kannon Temple. At the location of the stable, Yamazakura Shrine <span class='ja'>山桜神社</span> was established. Besides praying to Bato Kannon for protection and prosperity, the shrine specializes in protection from fire.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema Market <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Every year, the Yamazakura Shrine advertises in the town newsletter and I often see these advertisements around the shrine when I drive by. Rather than go to Matsukura Kannon, I wanted to visit a different Ema distributer this year.</p><p><p class="img"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link"><img style="height: 724px; width: 512; text-align: center;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" /></a></p></p><p>Yamazakura and Bato Kannon are celebrated on August 8th, 9th, and 10th each year at the Yamazakura shrine, but the shrine is open from August 1st to 10th at 10am to 3pm each day. I had time to visit on August 7th before class in the evening. You're able to make an order <a href="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html" title="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html">online</a> prior to visiting. But, if you just show up, they don't have a standard order form, like the Kannon temple. You just tell them your name, the Ema size, what color (black/white), and which way it should face (left/right).

It is overshadowed by many of the other great mountains in the area, but still a great morning climb for those staying in the Hida-yuu area. I had this mountain on my list of places to climb for years, and with recent motivation, I decided to finally tackle it.</p><div class='title'><b>Fukuji Onsen Morning Market <span class='ja'>福地温泉朝市</span></b></div><p>One of the big reasons for my visit was the morning market in the neighborhood at the base of the hike.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The morning market worked as a convenient store, a souvenir shop, and a retro museum all in one. The outside of the building was covered with old advertisements from the 60s. Inside, the walls and ceiling were covered with records and posters of idols and musicians from the 70s and 80s. The whole building was a time capsule of when Japan was rich and everyone enjoyed their music.</p><p>The market sold older classic toys, like Kendama, and had plenty of Hida souvenirs, too. I only bought a bottle of water and a map of the hike.</p><div class='title'><b>Hike</b></div><p>With all my items packed in my bag, I began the hike. The whole area of Fukuji and Hida-yuu is in a very deep valley. Once you got to the edge of the valley, the hike up the mountain was almost complete vertical. The hiking snaked back and forth, back and forth up the mountain-side, surrounded by equally vertically trees shielding you from the sky.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Obviously mountain hiking has a lot of vertical ascents, but I wasn't really prepared for how continuous this was. It was like a stair climb. I eventually caught up with another couple of hikers. They were from Montana and staying in Hida-yuu for the night. They thought they would do a quick morning hike before their bus at noon, but were also surprised with how rough the hike had been.</p><p>Additionally, often the hiking trail would be obscured. It was hard to tell where the trail headed compared with the surrounding ground. At one point, I went straight up, not realizing the trail was meant to snake around and come back to where I was.</p><p>The maps where also inaccurate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I took a photo of the map at the base of the hike, and was using that to figure out where I was and where I was going. All the distances are wrong. On the map, the start of the hike to the first branch point looks about the same distance from the branch point to the teacher statue, marked as <span class='ja'>石像</span> on the map. In reality, it took about 45 minutes to climb the mountain to reach the branch point, and only 15 minutes more to reach the statue.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The text reads <span class='ja'>篠原無然之像</span>, or Statue of Shinohara Mugen, and it was erected in May 1921 or Taishi 10 <span class='ja'>大正</span>10<span class='ja'>年</span>, as written on the statue. Shinohara Mugen was a man was loved nature and often hiked the mountains of Hida-yuu. With his hikes, he educated people about the trees, flowers, and plants that grew on the mountain. Because of this, after he passed, his students made this statue of him.</p><p>I was already an hour into the hike, and according to the map I was only a third done with the hike. I continued on. 30 minutes later, I reached viewpoint #2 <span class='ja'>第二展望台</span> as written on the map. Another time/distance that did not make sense to the scale of the map. The Montana couple I was with decided to give up, thinking that there was no way they'd be able to make it to the summit and back done in time for their bus.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643_t.webp" /></a></p><p>15 minutes later, I reached viewpoint #4 <span class='ja'>第二展望台</span>. Again, on the map, it was same distance as the previous 30 minutes and same distance as the original 45 minutes. Thank god for these actual markers or else I would have no idea where I actually was.</p><p>Another short 10 minutes, and I made it to the summit in a total of around 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Perhaps the funniest thing of the whole hike was that the view wasn't really all that great. It gave a great view of Tochio village leading into the Shinhotaka ropeway, but all the mountains were obscured by the clouds. Usually when there's a deep fog in Takayama in the morning, the sky above the fog is totally clear and by Noon everything goes away.</p><p>Not today, though. Sometimes the mountains make their own weather, and Fukuji-yama was a mountain much deeper into the country compared with Takayama's immedate surrounding mountains.</p><p>I took some photos and then started back down the mountains. Now knowing where to go and what paths to take and also not stopping so often for photos, I made it back down the mountain in only an hour compared to the two hours it took to climb.</p><div class='title'><b>Ramen</b></div><p>I don't often find myself in the eastern areas of Takayama. But, when I'm there and I have time and I'm hungry, I visit my favorite Ramen restaurant in Takayama.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's called Shonyudou <span class='ja'>鍾乳堂</span>, and it's the main restaurant in front of the Limestone cave in Nyukawa. They make the absolute best Okuhida Ramen. Takayama Ramen ends up getting a lot of praise, but the noodles are too stringy and the broth is too thin. Okuhida Ramen is thicker in both categories and has slices of ham, too. It's so good.</p><p>I'm not sure how many tourists they're able to get. But, it always seems like there's a local family or two in the restaurant. I'm glad they're still able to keep business after all these years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Overall, I think I enjoyed the hike.

It is one of the tallest mountains in the area at 1596 meters, and on a clear day, you'd be able to view both Toyama and Takayama cities from the top.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I had a friend coming to visit who was interested in doing a million things, and I had this mountain marked on my map from a while ago. So, we decided to take a look!</p><p>The pin on my map was for a parking lot pretty close to the peak, but after searching for hiking paths and current conditions, the Hida wilderness website marked the road closed due to a landslide. There's a hiking website (<a href="https://yamap.com/" title="https://yamap.com/">yamap.com</a>) where people record their hikes, and the most recent hikes of the mountain seemed to confirm it. </p><p>Using yamap as a guide, there were several places where we could start our hike, but ultimately we planned on starting at the campground where the road had been closed and going from there. Hikes on yamap confirmed this was possible.</p><div class='title'><b>The Climb</b></div><p>It took way longer to get to the campground than I had expected. We left a little later than planned, but the winding roads made us move very slowly.  Google Maps said it would only take an hour from my apartment. I think we left around 8:15am and finally made it to the campground at 10:05am. Even though we made two quick stops along the way, it took nearly 2 hours.</p><p>The campground was a nice piece of civilization carved out of the heavy thicket of trees and bushes. There was even a museum, or some kind of cultural hall, that detailed the surrounding nature. We didn't have time for it, though, and went straight on the path forward up the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The path itself was just the closed road, so it was pretty easy. We walked passed several dammed and relegated streams coming from above. Some of the cement structures lower in the streams had been eroded away.</p><p>The climb was steady and kept going and going. It wasn't long before we could see some of the height we had already traveled.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>45 minutes later, we hit the detour.  We had known that the road was closed due to a landslide, and the sign directed us to take this trail instead. It indicated that it led to the summit, and another hiker of their way down informed us that this was the way to go.  So we went.</p><p>Looking at Google Maps, it seems like the trail was about 600 meters.  Certainly not as long as the 3km we had already walked. However, our gradual 20 degree incline significantly spiked to 45 degrees, or more. The course had ropes to help pull ourselves up the climb, but it was still pretty rough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As in any marathon, you continue to push through and continue to move. The longer you stop, the longer it takes. But, my partner in climb doesn't do marathons, so we often took some breaks, which ended up being necessary. This trail completely exhausted my supply of water.</p><p>Another 45 minutes later, we reached the trail head and made it back to paved road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having gained some significant height, and as the paved road winded around the mountain to gain height, we often had a view that looked down on the path we've traveled. Just 10 minutes later, the top of the trail head looked so small and far away. Another 20 minutes later, even further. One of the best parts about this hike we being able to visually observe the distance we had traveled. We wouldn't have gotten this experience by simply driving to the top. On the other hand, we wouldn't have been dying of thirst and exhaustion either.</p><p>After 30 minutes, we reached the upper parking area at 12:15pm. There was no running water, but there were some jugs of water as to use as an emergency. It did not look safe, so we moved onward and upward. Often there were trails that appeared on the side the road that offered us a shorter path to the top. But, we had already experienced the cost of such shortcuts from the detour earlier, so we continued on the road.</p><p>45 minutes later, the emergency shelter came in view. We climbed up to it and took a break inside. Nearly to the top!</p><p>Outside of the shelter gave us our first grand view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think we stopped for about 10 minutes, and continued along the wooden path. Some of the path had degraded, and other parts were washed away from rain. The path looked like it went back down the other side of the mountain, which we didn't want to do. But, I scouted ahead and the path only dipped a little bit.</p><p>Around the corner, the path connected with the ridge line path. Going to the right, it lead to the peak.</p><div class='title'><b>Summit <span class='ja'>山頂</span></b></div><p>After nearly 3 hours of walking and hiking, and a total of around 8 or 9 kilometers, we had made it to the top. From the top, we had a 360-degree view of everything around us. The east (first panoramic photo below), the north (second), and the south and west (third).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The weather was pretty warm with only a few clouds when we started. But, there was a strong wind at the top. The wind had pulled in the clouds (and later on rain), so a lot of the view was covered. We could still see Toyama to the north, though not a lot of detail. To the south, we saw an area that had to be Takayama. We couldn't confirm it, but it couldn't have been anything else.</p><p>It wasn't really cold up there, but the wind was pretty strong. My hat blew clear off my head!</p><p>To the south-west was a Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span>, a small buddhist shrine. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I wonder how many buddhist monks hike the mountain to pray here.</p><p>The other notable location at the peak is a pond to the east. The trail maps said it would take about 25 minutes to get there (and another 25 minutes to get back), but looking at the time, we could not afford to go. We needed to get out of the mountains by sundown (5pm-ish), and we were getting close to that limit with the amount of time it would take to descend.</p><div class='title'><b>Descent</b></div><p>We left the summit before 2pm and took the paved road all the way down. At the top, the paved road began on a disheveled cracked helicopter pad. Moving down the road, some of it had been completely broken apart and ground into rock, but I think a car could still drive across it.</p><p>Turns out, going down the mountain is way more easy than going up. After about an hour, we made it back to the trail head for the detour. We decided to stay on the road this time, and go through construction. We knew how steep and hard the trail would be, and the construction and landslide couldn't be THAT bad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Turns out, we were right. The construction and road repair was already complete. If the gate had been opened at the campsite, we could've driven this whole distance. The construction sign we found a little bit later indicated that the road would be open on October 20th, so maybe they still needed to test their repair, or something.</p><p>This road led off in the opposite direction before meeting back to where the detour began. Going down, it took us 45 minutes from where the trail head ended to where it began. This was the same time it took us to climb up.</p><p>Because it went off into another part of the mountain, I started noticing a lot of vines choking and strangling the trees and brush on the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was so thick. Nothing our size would be able to move through it. Everything was covered with this vine. My friend mentioned that it was probably all one organism, too, that just continued to grow and grow.</p><p>Eventually we made it through the thicket. We reached the start of the trail head and made it to camp, a bit further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the mountain is a bit easier, but the constant stamping of feet on pavement takes it toll on the soles of feet and the hip. But! We arrived and were finally able to refill our water. Another hour of driving through the windy roads, and we were back to civilization.</p><p>It had a been a while since I had been on a hike, and this one turned into one of the longest hikes I've done in Hida. Much like a marathon, you often question why you ever decided to do it not long after beginning. But you move past that feeling and start enjoying the moment, the movement, the nature, and accomplishment. I need to do some more hiking.</p><p>Overall, this was a great hike, even though a bit rough. This would be excellent to do again with absolutely clear weather.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>9:27am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sugadaira Campground <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平キャンプ場</span> </td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (construction)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>End of Trail</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:00pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Emergency Shelter <span class='ja'>避難小屋</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692">36°25'02.1"N 137°06'42.1"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Summit <span class='ja'>白木峰山頂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222">36°24'56.1"N 137°06'44.0"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897">36°24'50.8"N 137°06'39.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:25pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (end) - skipped, took road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>3:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (start)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to car (Sugadaira Camp) <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:55pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>5:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kawai <span class='ja'>河合</span> 471 Interchange</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159">36°18'23.0"N 137°05'31.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These mountains lead to excellent vantage points of the city, but all have their own history, too. The southwest mountains of Matsukura <span class='ja'>松倉</span> and Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span> used to be the center point of the ruling class of the town.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>Back in the 1500s, Hida was its own province amongst the warring states, and the rulers were the Anekouji Clan <span class='ja'>姉小路</span>. Takayama was the most prosperous area of Hida because it was the most open. Farmers could easily till the land and feed all of its people. There was plenty of roam to rear livestock, such as horses and cows. And, Hida was also known for its expert carpenters. The mountain of Matsukura overlooked the entirety of Takayama, so it was the perfect point to build a stronghold to defend the city. This was Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span>.</p><p>Towards the end of the 1500s, Oda Nobunaga <span class='ja'>織田信長</span> had begun his conquest of defeating all independent clan and armies and unifying Japan as a single country. In 1585, he dispatched Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> to ascend the mountains of Hida and destroy the Anekouji Clan to claim the territory. The Anekouji Clan was easily outmatched, defeated, and killed.</p><p>With Hida and Takayama under the control of Nobunaga through Kanamori, peace came to the city, and Kanamori transformed the city into a vacation town for his rich friends.

People will often pray to Kannon for protection from illness and prosperity for their family and livelihood. Kannon has six transformations, and the Matsukura Kannon Temple specifically prays to the Bato Kannon transformation.</p><p>Bato Kannon is the more violent and warlike transformation, characterized by a menacing horse head. Horses were a very important animal and symbol of old Hida. There were used for farming, transportation, and many people considered them members of their family. People from Hida and even further would travel with their horses to the temple on July 9th every year, to pray for the wellbeing and protection of their horses.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> and Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Traveling up the mountain isn't so difficult today, but this was not the case 400 years ago. It caused a lot of stress for the horse. So, artists began painting horses on paper and selling them in downtown Takayama. These horse paintings were called Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span>, which literally translates to Horse Painting. Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span> means Horse Painting Market.</p><p>At this market, farmers would buy whichever horse painting they thought looked most like their horse. Then, they would bring this painting up the mountain to the Matsukura temple instead of their actual horse.</p><p>Over time, this painted horse became a symbol for more than just their horse. Because a family would rely on their horse for their farm, the horse painting now encompassed a person's entire farm or business. Families also consider their horse a member of their family, so the horse painting protection began to expand to other members of the family, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Day Emaichi</b></div><p>These days, the tradition continues. Almost every business throughout Hida (and most residences, too) will have a horse painting at the entrance. Pointed inward, the horse painting offers protection and prosperity for the business or family inside.</p><p>Every year on August 9th and 10th, the Bato Kannon deity is moved from the main Kannon temple in downtown Takayama into the Matsukura mountain. At this time, horse paintings are created for anyone that comes to visit and a Buddhist monk of the Kannon temple will infuse his prayer into the painting.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">8 years ago</a>, I came here for the first time after finally learning about the origins of the horse paintings that I saw everywhere.

| June 3, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In Takayama, there are two retro museums. I have been to Showa Hall many times, and that museum is an amazing cluttered collection of items, artifacts, and common things from Japanese households and businesses from the Showa period (and slightly beyond). With the popularity of Showa Hall, another retro museum opened around 2019, titled the Hida Takayama Retro Museum.</p><p>The Retro Museum doesn't have as many open areas as Showa Hall, so it doesn't give the sense of an old neighborhood. But it does have some unique rooms. In the Retro Museum, in the recreated old style classroom, you are able to purchase a school lunch set typical of classrooms over 50 years prior. There is also a recreated living room, with lots of old video games and toys. There's a pachinko parlor. And there's an arcade. Although, the arcade is really sparse.</p><p>(Update 2025) Many of these ideas were taken back by Showa Hall. Showa Hall now has a more faithful video game room and a pachinko parlor. There's no arcade, but arcades are really Heisei period things, not Showa.</p><p>Looking through Google Maps, this location used to be a public path. So maybe when the bath went out of business, Showa Hall picked up the location for its extra items. I often see flyers with both places advertised.</p><p>Take a look through the photos below. :)<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/hida-takayama/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/hida-takayama">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
