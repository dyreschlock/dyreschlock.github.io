| December 30, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Before returning to the states for winter vacation, I stayed in Tokyo for a full day.  One of my only goals in Tokyo was to visit Tokyo Skytree with the amazing weather for the weekend.  I went there last year, but didn't take many photos.  I wanted to correct that this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tokyo Skytree is now the tallest free standing tower in the world.  Construction finished in late 2012, and it was built to accommodate the much wider-band television broadcasts for the high definition age that Tokyo Tower could not longer support.  As such, Tokyo Skytree acts as a symbol of the future.  The same symbol <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014">Tokyo Tower</a> was 55 years ago.  </p><p>Skytree reaches 634 meters into the sky, which dwarfs Tokyo Tower's 333 meters.  634 is very deliberate choice.  Using <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase">goroawase</a>, the kanji of 634 <span class='ja'>六三四</span> can be read as mu-sa-shi, which, apparently, is the old name for the neighborhood where Skytree stands.  Musashi is also the name of a famous samurai.  It probably has several other meanings, too.</p><p>I wanted to get there as early as possible, since the weather was supposed to get more cloudy as the day went on.  I left my hotel room around 7:30am to meet the 8:00 opening, but it took a lot longer to get there than I had thought.  I finally arrived at 9am, but it was still early enough to miss the crowds.  There was absolutely no line, which was astonishing to me considering the hour wait from last year.  I was in the observation decks by 9:10.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The first observation deck was at a height of 350 meters, already taller than Tokyo Tower.  The weather was starting to get cloudy, but the view was still amazing and clear.  In fact, if you looked towards the west, the weather was clear enough to view Mt. Fuji.  It was still rather feint, but totally visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Further up, there's a second observation tower at 450 meters, but there really isn't much difference between the two views.  Both are high enough that you can see nearly all of the Tokyo metropolitan area.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9965_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9965_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9965_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9965_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9965_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0023_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0023_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0023_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0023_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0023_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0041_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0041_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0041_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0041_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0041_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The view is clearly different when comparing this to <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014">Tokyo Tower</a>.  The view from Tokyo Tower was probably amazing after its construction 60 years ago.  It's still amazing today, but many of the surrounding buildings have caught up to its height.  It's view is one amongst the city, rather than viewing it from above.</p><p>No other building in Tokyo comes close to the height of Skytree.  Every building is underneath its view.  So, It truly towers over the entire city.</p><p>The special observatory wraps around the outside of the tower with a slight incline.  You continue to climb until to reach the highest point in the tower.  Then it starts to decline back to the return elevatory.  I didn't spend too much more time in the tower after that.  On my way out, the place was completely packed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was at 11:00am.  When I arrived, two hours prior, there was absolutely no one here.  Maybe the shuttle buses didn't begin operation until after 9am or something.  I'm not quite sure why people wouldn't have come earlier to avoid this mess.</p><p>Outside, a few blocks away, I came across a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp">bootleg</a> merchandise shop.  Everything looked so cheap and crappy from the window that I did not inquire.</p><p>Anyway, there you go.  That's Tokyo Skytree.  It's pretty neat, though quite expensive.  Entrance is 2400<span class='ja'>円</span>, and an additional 1200<span class='ja'>円</span> to go to the special observatory.  I think it's worth it for a single visit, but not really for repeats.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sunset at Sunshine City 60" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sunset-at-sunshine-city-60">Sunset at Sunshine City 60</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 25, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been about a month, but on Nov 16th, I took and passed my Shodan level Kendo examination. :D</p><p>I wrote a little bit about this leading up to the exam on <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  Shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, or "first dan", and the first level of dan mastery in Kendo.  Dan mastery is somewhat similar to the black belt scale in Karate.  So, achieving Shodan is similar to a first level black belt.  There are no belts or additional decoration used in Kendo, though.</p><p>Prior to dan mastery, there is kyuu mastery, which is reserved for beginners of Kendo, usually elementary students, and beginning junior high students.</p><div class='title'><b>Examination Day</b></div><p>The test was held at Big Arena on Sunday Nov 16th.  The doors to Big Arena opened at 8am, and there were plenty of students waiting by the doors before then.  Additionally, there were basketball and table tennis tournaments held that day, too.  The Kendo test was held in the martial arts hall within the complex.</p><p>As the doors opened, everyone filled into the building.  I went upstairs and into the testing area.  Several of the beginner students I practice with were there taking the Kyuu tests for the first time.  One of my former students was there taking the "second dan" test, ni-dan <span class='ja'>二段</span>.  I had been practicing with him for the past month in preparation. :)</p><p>Everyone registered for their respective tests, and paid their fees.  The Shodan test was almost 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><div class='title'><b>Kyuu Examination <span class='ja'>級審査</span></b></div><p>The Kyuu-level tests began at 9am.  They first began with correct execution of the Kendo waza techniques.  These are a series of moves performed with another test taker.  One acts as the attacker.  The other as the defender.  Then when complete they switch roles.  These are performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span> (wooden sword), and without any protective gear.  The moves are performed in a deliberate and methodical way to correctly show one's understanding of how the move is to be correctly executed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" /></p><p>Secondly, the test takers are evaluated on moves performed in real-time.  These moves are performed with all the gear worn by the test taker, and with a shinai <span class='ja'>竹刀</span> (bamboo sword).  Same as the first test, test takers perform these moves on each other.  One is the attacker.  The other is the defender.  Then they switch.  Additionally, for "first kyuu", or Ikkyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span>, the test ends with both test takers performing as many moves as they can against each other in a "practice" match.  The lower levels don't require this.</p><p>As the different kyuu-level tests complete, the results are posted on the wall, the taker's kendo licenses are stamped and certificates are handed out.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Examination <span class='ja'>段審査</span></b></div><p>Once all the Kyuu tests were complete, then the Dan tests finally began.  I think our tests began 10:30.  There are 3 tests, and each is immediate elimination.  Meaning: if you fail a test, you do not continue.  I was most worried about the first test.</p><p>The first test is a practice shiai <span class='ja'>試合</span>, or match, but it's performed much differently than in a tournament.  In this match, when you meet your opponent, you carefully study their posture, their movements, and their feelings.  When you understand your opponent, then you can interpret intentions, and correctly strike and respond to their movements.  </p><p>My biggest problem with doing this part of the test is my bulky slow-ass giant body.  These junior high kids are way too fast for me.  For some students, I can see their attacks coming, but I can't parry and counter fast enough to make a valid strike.  Other times, I can't even see their attacks coming because they whip around their shinai so fast.</p><p>This test isn't about winning or losing, though.  Reading your opponent is certainly key.  But more important is that you follow through with your movements to completion.  At least, that's how I understand it.  I think there are other factors at play, too.</p><p>For this test, examinees perform twice against two other examinees, and each match is one minute.  That's it.  As usual, I was in the last group.  I took my turn, and performed the test as I understood it.  I was certainly nervous, but I had been practicing so much over the past 2 months, and regularly practicing with students of similar level that it really didn't bother me as much as it did during the previous test.  I knew what to do.</p><p>So, I passed the first part of the test without a problem.  I was slow a couple of times, but I guess I was sufficient where it mattered.</p><div class='title'><b>Part 2 and 3</b></div><p>After more than an hour lunch break, we continued the test with the reminder of the test takers.  All the kyuu-level examinees were already gone at this point, so the crowd of parents was pretty sparse.</p><p>Part 2 is correctly performing dan-level waza, which are higher-level kendo techniques performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span>.  I had been practicing these so much over the previous 3-4 months that they were completely internalized.  All the kendo instructors kept putting such an importance on them that I don't think I could ever forgot them.  During the test, though, we only needed to perform one side of the waza.  We were random chosen to either be attacker or defender, and that was it.  All examinees passed.</p><p>Part 3 of the test was the written exam.  This is what I wrote about before: <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  There are 4 questions total on the test chosen from a pool of 6.  Each examinee basically needed to memorize the answer, and write it down on the test.  You didn't need to write it in your own words.  And didn't need to write anything dealing with comprehension.  Only memorization.  (In my opinion, that doesn't really teach anything, but whatever.)</p><p>My written test was completely in English because I'm terrible at Japanese.  The English answers for the test were somewhat based on my translation of the booklet, too, so memorizing the answers was pretty easy (since they were written in my voice).  I was able to completely memorize the 6 questions within two days on the test.  Apparently, when grading my test, the proctor had commented that I had written everything 100% perfect.</p><p>So, I passed. :)  So too did everyone else that made it to this point.</p><p>I am one of perhaps ten or twenty foreigners to ever take and pass the Shodan exam in Gifu-ken.</p><div class='title'><b>Success!</b></div><p>I was rather nervous about whether I could pass the test, but a lot of that nervousness turned into confidence as the test drew closer.  I had been training every day leading up to the test, and was doing everything nearly perfect during practice.  My waza was totally perfect a few weeks prior to the test.  And I knew I could memorize the written part.  This was my third time taking a kendo exam, too, so I knew what to expect, and how to deal with things.  I didn't want to be too confident and have that turn to arrogance...  but I knew I could pass.  </p><p>Some of the student's parents were pretty confident I could pass as well.  They called the newspaper prior to the test so they could interview me and write an article about me.  The reporter asked me rather standard questions.  "How do you feel?" "How long have you done Kendo?" "Why do you do Kendo?" etc.  They asked my Kendo instructor questions as well.</p><p>It appeared in the Takayama newspaper the next day:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This brought me plenty of attention.</p><p>My student's parents read the newspaper, and noticed me.  The next day at school, all the students made comments about it, and congratulated me.  <span class='ja'>ジム先生、初段におめでとう</span>!  Some parents made their kids memorize their congratulations in English, and recite it to me.  Several teachers made a big deal out of it, too, making the whole class congratulate me before we started.  Plenty of students knew that I practiced and performed Kendo after school, but now everyone knew.</p><p>On Friday, a reporter from the Hida section of the Gifu newspaper wanted to write an article of their own.  They came to school, and interviewed me for about an hour.  She asked the same questions, but with more depth.</p><p>Again, the next day, it appeared in the paper:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between both these articles, I don't actually know the extent of what they wrote, since I'm terrible at Japanese.  It's also difficult for me to fully articulate myself when I can't do it in Japanese, and the person doesn't completely understand English.  As such, I don't think my responses were really all that interesting.  Nor can I really tell if they printed some shit about me.  (I did notice in the first article that I'm from Australia.)</p><p>This newspaper reaches A LOT more people than the Takayama paper.  Plus, it was the top story in this section of the newspaper, and it took up about a quarter of the page.</p><p>Now, everyone in my daily life knew that I did Kendo, and couldn't wait to congratulate me.  Teachers in other schools that I hadn't met, congratulated me.  The employees working at the convenience stores, grocery stores, gas station, and dry cleaning places I regularly visit, all recognized me in the paper and congratulated me the next time I went there.  Even the delivery man made a comment after dropping off a package.  <span class='ja'>いつもおめでとう</span>.  <span class='ja'>剣道をがんばってましょう</span>.</p><p>It wasn't that I hated the attention.  I mean, I already stand out quite a bit as a foreigner, which gives me attention on its own.  This is now yet another way of people paying attention to me.  Too much attention.  It was all positive attention, though, so I'm thankful for that. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Kendo continues to be amazing for me in Takayama, so I will absolutely continue to improve myself, and climb the rankings ladder.  After shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, the next level of mastery is nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span>, or "second dan."  The rules of ranking prohibit anyone from taking the nidan exam until one year after achieving shodan.  So, I won't be able to get nidan until November 2015.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, maybe 10 or 20 foreigners have gotten shodan in Gifu in the past.  Maybe 1 or 2 have gotten nidan.  None have ever gotten sandan <span class='ja'>三段</span> (third dan).  I don't think that's necessarily because of a skill-gap, or difficulty gap (though, I could be wrong.)  Nidan seems almost identical to Shodan, with the addition of more waza, and some different questions on the test.</p><p>I think the biggest gap is time.  Most ALTs only stay in Japan for 3 years at the most.  It's not that usual for someone to stay 4 or 5 years (which is the absolute max).  Between shodan and nidan, you must wait a year.  Between nidan and sandan, you must wait 2 years.  At this point, if I pass my nidan test next year, and stay for a 5th year, my sandan test would be after my contract is finished in Takayama.  I'm not sure where I'll be in November 2017, but it won't be Takayama.</p><p>I definitely plan on getting nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span> next year.  From there, I plan on continuing Kendo all the way up until I leave Takayama.  Hopefully where I am after, I will have the means to continue, then return to Takayama for the sandan test.  Who knows, though.  A lot can happen in the next 2 1/2 years.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokedex Nearly Complete!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete">Pokedex Nearly Complete!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 21, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After taking a break for a few weeks, I completed Pokemon Omega Ruby today.  There's still the Delta Episode to complete, plus several legendaries to scoop up, though.</p><p>Omega Ruby is pretty damn good.  They've cleaned up a lot of rough edges from Pokemon X, and there's a ton of end game, and side content.  WAY more than Pokemon X/Y.  I think the only shame is not continuing the character customization from Pokemon X, but that's fine.</p><p>Right now, my Pokedex for Pokemon X is at 718*, and Omega Ruby is at 716 out of a (current) possible 719.  I need an Aromatisse, and Yveltal for Omega Ruby, and a Meloetta for both games.  I'm so close to completing the Pokedex, a challenge that I began 10 years ago with Pokemon Emerald.  It's somewhat fitting that I'm so close to completing that goal with the remake.</p><p>Also, between Pokemon White, Pokemon X, and Omega Ruby, I have several EV trained and move balanced Pokemon, that I could probably make a decent and competitive league team.  So I might start doing that next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokedex Completion History</b></div><p>Nearly 10 years ago, I picked up Pokemon Emerald and played it quite a bit with my girlfriend at the time.  We started doing this around the time Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green were released, so after we completed Emerald, I bought Fire Red, and she bought Leaf Green.  We ran through both games, and given our position, I suggested we could probably complete the Pokedex between the both of us.</p><p>We got close before giving up.  At the time, there were a possible 386 pokemon.  I think my Emerald pokedex was around 340, or 360, maybe?  For event pokemon, we had a Jirachi, but did not have Mew, Celebi, or Deoxys.</p><p>Then next time I really played Pokemon was when I studied abroad and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were released in Fall 2006.  Later, back in the states, I bought Pokemon Platinum on its release, and went all the way through that game.  Throughout this time, I was collecting each event Pokemon upon its availability.  Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out.  I started going through Soul Silver, but got bored.</p><p>When Pokemon White and Black were released, I actually had a friend who played and cared about the games, too.  I played through White and she played through Black.  We both caught all the exclusive Pokemon and traded them back and forth to complete our Pokedexes.</p><p>At this point, my dream to complete the Pokedex was rekindled.  Starting with Generation III (ruby / sapphire / emerald / leaf green / fire red), you could migrate your Pokemon to the next generation.  So all my Pokemon from Emerald could be moved to Platinum, and from Platinum to Pokemon White.  With my hefty amount of Pokemon from Emerald, and complete saves on Platinum and White, I was able to fill out the new rosters, and get closer.</p><p>I bought some of the older copies of the games to fill out the starters I was missing.  And I even bought a new Nintendo DS, so I could trade and transfer Pokemon between the Gen IV and Gen V games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" /></p><p>This was about 4 years ago.  After the release of Black and White 2, my Pokedex on Pokemon White was at 647 out of 649.  I was missing at Latios, which was available to capture in Pokemon Soul Silver, but I just got so bored playing that game.  And I was missing Meloetta, which was an event Pokemon not yet released.  Almost complete!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Meloetta was released after I starting living in Japan, so I had no way of getting it.  Maybe I had a chance while in Japan, but I missed that opportunity.</p><p>Pokemon X and Y came out last year, bumping the total amount of Pokemon to 718, with an additional 3 event Pokemon yet to be released, announced, or even available in the Pokedex.  Pokemon X was rather boring, though.  There were very few new Pokemon, and the controls were somewhat rocky especially after playing Zelda.  I captured all the Pokemon, though, and during Christmas break, traded back and forth to complete the new set.</p><p>At the time, there was also no built-in way to transfer Gen IV Pokemon to the new games.  Later, an app was released, Pokemon Bank, that allowed you to do this.  I got bored with Pokemon X, so I left it.</p><p>But, ramping up to the release of Omega Ruby, and the release of Diancie, the 719th Pokemon, I started getting into Pokemon again.  I migrated all my Pokemon forward, and filled in any holes I was missing in my Pokedex.  I was now at 717, with only Meloetta and Latios missing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" /></p><p>Playing through Omega Ruby, they basically just give you Latios for free.  You don't even need to battle and catch it.  It felt somewhat empty to have finally catch this Pokemon without even a fight, but whatever.  *My Pokemon X Dex is still at 717, though, because I'm too lazy too transfer it.</p><p>I transferred all my Pokemon over to Omega Ruby, but I do not actually have a living "copy" of Aromatisse and Yveltal (from Pokemon X/Y), so my Omega Ruby Dex is at 716.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing the journey from 10 years ago to 4 years ago to today, these are the games and handhelds I have with me in Japan.  There are still some Pokemon left to capture and transfer from Soul Silver, so I might start playing that again.  My save is just after catching Lugia, and before Victory Road.</p><p>Anyway, <b>I'm so close!</b>  I'm only missing 3 pokemon, and the additional 2 yet unreleased event pokemon.  (Though, #720 Hoppa might be soon.)</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>After playing the shit out of Pokemon White, I became more interested in some of the meta-game aspects of raising and breeding pokemon.  I designed, and started training a balanced EV trained team.  I completely trained 3 pokemon out of the 6 I had planned before I got bored, and gave up.</p><p>I started playing Pokemon X again right before Omega Ruby's release, and EV trained some more pokemon.  EV training is SO easy in Gen VI.  I am so thankful for that.  I completely trained 2 pokemon in that game.</p><p>And with Omega Ruby, I bred and EV trained 4 pokemon in Pokemon X, transferred them to Omega Ruby, and played through all of the game with them.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, with these pokemon, I think I'll make a team, and start competing online.  Why not, right?  With my sole goal of pokemon (finishing the Pokedex) basically complete, I should start getting into the aspect of pokemon that has really kept the franchise alive: battling and competing.</p><p>We'll see, though, maybe I'll lose a lot, get bored, and give up.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next?</b></div><p>I'm super interested to see what they have planned next.  With the addition of Mega evolutions, I think they've pretty much run out of ideas to keep Pokemon fresh.  Pokemon releases are now almost a yearly occurrence.</p><p>2007 = Pokemon Diamond + Pearl<br/>2009 = Pokemon Platinum<br/>2010 = Pokemon Heart Gold + Soul Silver<br/>2011 = Pokemon Black + White<br/>2012 = Pokemon Black + White 2<br/>2013 = Pokemon X + Y<br/>2014 = Pokemon Omega Ruby + Alpha Sapphire</p><p>I could totally see a Pokemon Z (or whatever) coming out in 2015, too.  Maybe that game would bring over all the engine fixes in Omega Ruby, and also correctly bridge the two games.  And perhaps have a lot of good end game content, too.</p><p>But, they really need to take a break.  Pokemon needs some breathing room.</p><p>Anyway, that's my story.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to After the December Blizzard" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/december-snow-2">After the December Blizzard</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, this morning, the snow was done, and the sky was beginning to clear.</p><p>According to the news, by 3pm yesterday, the mountains in Niigata had received the most snowfall at 200 centimeters.  Mountainous areas of Nagano, Fukushima, Gunma, and Fukui had received between 150 and 180 centimeters at the most.  (Easy conversion:  100 cm = 1 m =~ 1 yard = 3 feet).</p><p>Locally, the Hida area and Gujo city received plenty of snow, too.  Hida Kawai received 136 centimeters since 3pm yesterday.  Shirotori in Gujo got 131, and Shirakawa-go had gotten 125.  In Takayama, we got about 120cm, maybe.  Meanwhile, Gifu City (in the south) got only 6 centimeters.  Unfortunately, within the Hida region and Gujo city limits, about 7770 households are without power, which means they have no heat.

| December 18, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It has been snowing for 3 days straight in the city of Takayama.  According to the Internet, we've received about 85 cm since this time yesterday.  And by this time yesterday, teachers were convinced that amount had already fallen.  It certainly doesn't seem like we've accumulated nearly 5 feet of snow, but I guess it's possible.</p><p>Takayama City actually canceled school today, which is almost unheard of.  For most teachers in Takayama, they can't remember a time of school ever being canceled due to snow.  (Though, they seem to cancel school pretty often for typhoons.)  Yesterday, school was let out early, too.</p><p>But!  While school is canceled, that doesn't mean it's a day off for the teachers.  We still must come to school because it's our job.  This morning I cleared more than a foot of snow off of my car, and had to shovel a path in front of my car in order to make it onto the road.  One of my neighbors had his car stuck and blocking traffic, too, so I helped push his car out of the ditch.  But I made it to school on time.  No problem.</p><p>At school, all of us teachers went outside, shoveled snow, and knocked snow off of the trees.  There was definitely more than 3 feet of snow piled up on the school grounds, so maybe we have accumulated 5 feet overall.  After that, we dispersed throughout the neighborhood to check for any "dangers".</p><p>Today, I'm at Minami Elementary School, which is located near the center of town near the train station.  Because this school is so centrally located, there are no buses.  All students walk to school, so when we check for "dangers", we're basically verifying that the routes students take to get to school are safe for the students to travel.  I guess I'm not sure what we were actually looking for.  Sinkholes?  Or downed power lines?  The routes I (and another teacher) checked were clear of those dangers.  Though, the snow was piled up so much that anyone walking was basically forced into the streets.  I figured that was pretty dangerous.</p><p>But whatever... Students weren't coming to school today anyhow.  As I walked around, I took several photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp"/></a></p><p>We basically just cover the north-western blocks from the school to the supermarket to the river and back.  Plenty of residents were outside shoveling snow, and clearing their cars and driveways.  We didn't see any kids, though, which was weird.  You'd think they'd be running around playing in the snow.  Though, I suppose the streets were pretty dangerous with oncoming traffic.</p><div class='title'><b>Shoveling Snow in Takayama</b></div><p>There is one big difference between shoveling snow in the Midwest and in Japan.  In the Midwest, you typically shovel snow from your driveway into your yard.  However, in Japan, there are no yards.  At least, not in the city area.  Thankfully, I live near a river.  So, when it snows enough to be shoveled, my whole neighborhood just shovels all the snow into the river.</p><p>During our neighborhood safety check, plenty of citizens were doing the same.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp"/></a></p><p>If you live near a river, you basically fill up one of those sleds with snow, drag it to the river, and chuck in it.  And repeat until complete.  Sometimes, residents will fill up a pickup truck with snow, and then drive to the river and dump it.</p><p>Another method for the more landlocked neighborhoods of Takayama is using the gutters on the sides of the roads.  There is enough water running in Takayama, that it never freezes.  Some neighborhoods open up the gutters running on the sides of the streets, and shove the snow inside.  The running water melts the snow, and carries it away.  These neighborhoods are usually tightly packed, so they don't really have a lot of snow to shovel anyway.  It's usually just the strip of sidewalk in front of their house.</p><p>One other method by the lazy residents of town is shoveling the snow into the street.  In a typical winter Takayama day, it snows throughout the night, and warms up a bit during the day.  The warmth during the day usually melts whatever snow collected on the roads overnight.  So by pushing the snow in the streets, cars will run over it, and the daily warmth will melt and get rid of it.  It's still lazy, though.</p><p>Anyway...  maybe the snow was stop tonight some time, and we'll actually have class tomorrow.  Or maybe not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hernan Cattaneo @ Club Mago, Nagoya" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hernan-catteneo-club-mago-nagoya">Hernan Cattaneo @ Club Mago, Nagoya</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 17, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It has been nearly 2 years since I've been to a club, and actually heard some electronic dance music live.  After moving to Japan, I've focused on working in my remote town in the mountains.  But, this past weekend, I just happened to be free, and noticed that <b>Hernan Cattaneo</b> just happened to be nearby.  Way too coincidental to ignore.  I made the drive <a href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter" title="/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">from Takayama to Nagoya</a>, and went to see him.</p><div class='title'><b>Location</b></div><p>Club Mago is pretty easy to find.  It's a few blocks down from the Saeki area of Nagoya.  It's located within some standard looking building, which is currently under construction.  The club itself is on the 2nd floor of the basement, and shares the space with another venue.</p><p>Outside, there are plenty of open lots for parking.  Several were full when I arrived, but past 10 o'clock, those lots began to empty out, and there was plenty of space.  I parked in the lot directly across the street from the club.  At the end of the night, parking was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Inside, Club Mago is pretty small.  Once you get into the basement, you walk down a somewhat narrow hall, turn the corner, and are directly at the entry counter.  You pay your, and go inside.  There are two rooms.  </p><div class='title'><b>Space</b></div><p>The first room is fully lit, has several tables, and plenty of seating.  This area would probably feel like a club, if it weren't lit like someone's basement.  Stuffed around a corner in the room is a DJ spinning some lounge-y tunes.  And next to him is a food bar.</p><p>The next room has the main area.  Immediately to right when entering is the bar.  There are some seats at the bar, and across the way on the left tables and more seats.  The bar is maybe 12 or 15 feet long.  Then the room opens up into the dance area.</p><p>I feel like calling this place a "club" is a bit incorrect.  It's definitely a venue.  Past the bar, it's standing room only, and it's very dimly lit.  The floor, walls, and ceiling are painted black, and there's maybe 8 lighting rigs setup on the ceiling to illuminate the place.  It's not really flashy like I would imagine a club in a city as large as Nagoya to be.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9115_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Though, I think the real difference is that this place really doesn't have any offerings for V.I.Ps, or big spenders.  The dance floor is wide open for everyone.  There are no expensive drinks.  Cover charge is the same for everyone.  Everyone is the same.  This is way more characteristic of a venue than a club.</p><p>Obviously, there's nothing wrong with this.  I was just expecting something flashy and ridiculous as Japan often tends to do, but this was way more down to earth and normal.  I need to go to a club in Tokyo or Osaka and see how this compares.</p><div class='title'><b>Opener and DJ Ogawa</b></div><p>Though, upon entering, I definitely felt at home.  The opener prior to DJ Ogawa was spinning some familiar tunes I had heard recently on the Internet radio, and mixing them together quite well.  The first song was something off one of the recently Jody Wisternoff Intesifieds.  He mixed that into some remix of Delirium - After All.  The crowd was very sparse at this point.  There were probably around 20 people.  It was only 11pm, though.</p><p>The space began to fill up, little by little, and by midnight, DJ Ogawa took over.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9126_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He cranked out some pretty bangin' tunes, which certainly fired up the crowd.  I mentioned on Facebook that there were all rather predictable, though.  Predictable build, predictable release.  It was fine.  Certainly something the crowd needed in order to be ready for Hernan.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p>Hernan took over the decks around 1am.  According to Facebook, he was billed for a 5 hour set.  I really wonder if he kept going all the way 'til 6am.  I can't say, since I could not keep myself awake that late. :(</p><p>As he took over, his first tracks sustained the vibe built by Ogawa.  It was still a bangin' beat that kept the more energetic members of the crowd on their toes, and moving around.  Other members of the crowd weren't quite awake yet.</p><p>The crowd was yet another indication that I was at a venue, and not a club.  No one was really dressed to impress.  Most dudes that entered where simply wearing their street clothes.  Some were still wearing their backpacks, and bags.  Most dudes entered the dance floor, danced and rocked out with themselves.  Almost all of the crowds were dudes, really.  Very few woman.  Those that were there, really just danced and rocked out with themselves, too.  The crowd was really wholly comprised of music nerds and baseheads.</p><p>There were certainly outliers, though.  Mainly the western foreigners in the audience.  They actually came in groups, and danced with themselves.  They were drinking, yelling, and moving around the most.  They actually dressed up expecting this place to be an actual club.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At first, it seemed like Hernan was fighting the crowd.  He would play a bangin' track, and some members of the crowd began rocking out to it.  After the track, Hernan would pull back a little bit, and layer his songs.  It felt like he was building an atmosphere, a vibe.  He was really getting into his tracks, and letting us all see inside himself.</p><p>But the crowd didn't care.  As Hernan trailed making music, and building something, the crowd got bored, and mostly stopped moving.  Hernan threw back into more energetic songs to bring the crowd back on his side.  But when he trailed off again, the crowd didn't budge.  The crowd kinda sucked because it was a beautiful gorgeous vibe.  Any crowd from Chicago would've been following him completely.</p><p>Eventually he gave up, and turned his vibe far more energetic to appease the crowd.  Once Hernan changed and found the correct atmosphere for the crowd, the crowd completely woke up, and kept moving from that point on.  The more still crowd members began leaving as time went by.  Which left the true fans (and the drunk fans).  Past 3am, the crowd was amazing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9183_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141213_cattaneo/IMG_9196_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Almost past 3am, I was starting to lose my energy.  I went back on the dance floor and rocked out for a while, but once I was out, I was done for the night.  I think I finally left around 4am.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>It was a pretty great night.  Though, it didn't really transform me in the way I was thinking.  When I was in the club and rocking with the music, I was no longer in Japan.  I was back in my music, and my vibe.  It was like any other club experience I've had back in the states.  I was no longer foreign.</p><p>This is a bit arrogant to say, but everyone else felt foreign like they didn't understand Hernan's vibe, and it took them a little while to adapt and change.  (Even though, Hernan was the one really changing his "tune".)</p><p>It was good to feel normal again.  Though, I've been away from the states long enough now, my "previous" life in the states is no longer normal for me.  Normal is coming back to Takayama and teaching these kids.</p><p>When I left the club, the musical vibe stayed with me.  But, as soon as I entered a convenience store to buy some water, I was back in Japan, and the music faded.  I was once again the foreigner, and out of place.  It's weird having my previous and current lives cross over each other.</p><p>Anyway, I'll certainly return there in the future when another fantastic DJ visits.  Great set by Hernan.  Hopefully I can stay awake next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I drove down to Nagoya to listen to some music.  Nagoya is almost directly south from Takayama.  When taking the Express Way, it's pretty much direct.  Just go south, and you're nearly there.  It's about a 2 1/2 hour drive, so I compare it to a drive from Madison, WI to Chicago.</p><p>However, there is one huge difference between those two drives:  <b>elevation</b>.  Takayama sits in an open plateau on the west end of the Japanese alps surrounded by some of the tallest mountains in Japan.  Nagoya is a port city near the Pacific Ocean.  So while the temperature drops, and the snow begins to fall in Takayama, it's still Autumn down in Nagoya.</p><p>And the drive between Takayama and Nagoya highlights these seasonal changes in a mere 2 hour span.  I took photos on the way down, and on the way back.  Here's my trip on the way back:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In Nagoya, it was partly cloudy.  This was at 11:00am.  The sky wasn't a pure blue, but there were breaks that let the sun shine through.  As I got out of the main urban sprawl of Nagoya into Ichinomiya, I was traveling directly north, and pointed towards a storm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those road signs above mention that at Seki <span class='ja'>関</span> and Minokamo <span class='ja'>美濃加茂</span>, there are safety checks to ensure drivers are properly applying and using chains on their tires.  It was still totally clear.</p><p>I crossed prefectural lines into Gifu-ken <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>.  As I approached Seki, I entered the storm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9303_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9307_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the snow raged, it immediately melted when it touched the ground.  I was still south enough where the ground was warm.</p><p>As I continued, the houses began showing snow collecting on the roofs.  I reached Minokamo, and all traffic was diverted into the rest area.  Traffic officials were present to check cars for winter tires and chains, and help anyone putting chains on their tires.  After returning to the Express Way, snow began to collect on the ground.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The roads were still totally safe.  They were treated enough to melt the snow on contract and keep the traffic moving at a brisk pace.</p><p>I passed through Gujo Hachiman, and then reached Gujo Yamato.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Snow was definitely beginning to pile along the sides of the roads.  But still no ice.</p><p>Past Gujo Hachiman <span class='ja'>郡上八幡</span>, the exits are as follows: Gujo Yamato <span class='ja'>郡上大和</span>, Shirotori <span class='ja'>白鳥</span>, Takasu <span class='ja'>高鷲</span>, Hiragano Kogen <span class='ja'>ひらがの高原</span>, Shokawa <span class='ja'>荘川</span>, and Hida Kiyomi <span class='ja'>飛騨清見</span>.  Gujo City's area continues to Hiragano Kogen, and Shokawa is when you finally reach the Hida Area, and Takayama City.</p><p>Once you pass Shirotori, the two-lane express way turns into a single lane.  This is also to point when you enter the most snow-ridden areas (and the best ski areas) of Gifu prefecture.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Lots of snow accumulation, and some ice has begun to form on the road.</p><p>Past Takasu, and leading into Hiragano Kogen, the ice begins to grow and take over the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9335.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9335.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9335_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9335_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9335_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9339.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9339_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9339_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9339_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9347.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9347_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9347_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9347_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Past Hiragano Kogen, and heading into the Takayama City Limits, ice and snow has completely overtaken the road.  Travel is pretty slick, but not completely intraversable.  The snow packs and creates enough friction to turn and stop.  Plus, my kei-car naturally drags, so I can slow down fast enough if I need to.</p><p>Once past Shokawa, though, the snow starts to let up a little bit, and the accumulation on the road isn't as great.  Takayama has quite a bit of snow, but it's not too bad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Within the city proper, it's pretty close to 0 degrees, so the snow is easy to shovel and move away.  The roads are mostly clear of snow, too.  I arrived home around 1:00pm.</p><p>It's pretty crazy to think that a mere 2 hours away down south, it was probably still sunny, and completely free of any precipitation.  If this were a drive from Madison to Chicago, the weather would be almost identical.  Living in the mountains is amazing.  We're in our own little winter wonder world up here away from the rest of civilization. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hideaki Anno's Sci Fi Exhibit - Tokusatsu 特撮" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hideaki-anno-scifi-exhibit-tokusatsu">Hideaki Anno's Sci Fi Exhibit - Tokusatsu 特撮</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
