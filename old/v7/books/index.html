| August 27, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I was cruising on ebay the other day, and came across this little gem.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp"  /></p><p>As you can tell from the picture, it's entitled the <b>Gainax Interviews</b>.  Published in 2005, this is a 536 page book featuring very lengthy interviews with almost everyone remotely noteworthy who has ever been a part of <b>Gainax</b>.</p><p>For those who don't know, Gainax is a Japanese Animation Studio responsibility for such anime movies and television shows as <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, <b>Gunbuster</b>, <b>Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water</b>, <b>Neon Genesis Evangelion</b>, <b>His and Her Circumstances</b>, <b>FLCL</b>, <b>Gurren Lagann</b>, <b>Panty and Stocking</b>, and a couple others, mostly maid anime.</p><p>I've been a fan of Gainax ever since I first watched Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Akira initially showed me how detailed and brutal Japanese animation can be, but Evangelion showed me the amount of depth most anime go into when describing and building a character while still having some amazing animated scenes.</p><p>I watched their other work, and they continued to impress and amaze me.  More over, I began completely amazed by the director and chief creative input behind many of their shows, Hideaki Anno.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp"  /></p><p>The book has a sizable interview with him.  I can't really read Japanese (yet), but above the specific question deals with the work he did before he, Takeda, Masayuki, and Higuchi banded together to form Gainax.  He worked as a key animation on the Gundam series for Sunrise, and, as the photo in the corner indicates, he got his big break key animating the God Warrior scene at the end of Ghibli's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.</p><p>Aside from Anno, the book focuses on the interviews of 15 people who helped shape Gainax throughout the years.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp"  /></p><p><b>Yasuhiro TAKEDA</b> : co-founder, general manager<br/><b>Hideaki ANNO</b> : co-founder, creator of Evangelion, director of Evangelion, Nadia, Gunbuster, His and Her Circumstances, and some others<br/><b>Masayuki</b> : assistant and alternate director of Evangelion<br/><b>Yoshiyuki SADAMOTO</b> : co-founder, character designer for Honneamise, Evangelion, Nadia<br/><b>Toshimichi OHTSUKI</b> : producer of Evangelion, FLCL<br/><b>Hiroki SATO</b> : producer of FLCL and most of their maid anime shows<br/><b>Masahiko OHTSUKI</b> : technical director of FLCL, Evangelion, and some others<br/><b>Shinji HIGUCHI</b> : co-founder, storyboards and special effects for Honneamise, Gunbuster, Evangelion.  Also, special effects director for most of the Gamera films.<br/><b>Shouji MURAHAMA</b> : worked at Daicon Film.  Later founded Gonzo.<br/><b>Yasuhiro KAMIMURA</b> : key animator for Evangelion.  digital artist for FLCL.<br/><b>Kazuya TSURUMAKI</b> : protege of Hideaki Anno, director of Evangelion, FLCL, His and Her Circumstances<br/><b>Tadashi HIRAMATSU</b> : storyboards, and key animator for Evangelion, FLCL, Gurren Lagann, and shit loads more.<br/><b>Takami AKAI</b> : character designer for Daicon III.<br/><b>Shigeru WATANABE</b> : producer of Honneamise and Gunbuster.  Later, did MANY other things.<br/><b>Hiroyuki YAMAGA</b> : co-founder, director of Honneamise</p><p>Also, in the back there's a glossary of a bunch of terms, and other things related to Gainax for quick reference.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4676.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, this book is over 500 pages of first hand accounts and information of the founding, rise, success, and aftermath of one of the most influential Anime studios of all time.  All of which I can't really read at the moment. :(</p><p>This is very similar to another book I own, but from a single point of view.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp"  /></p><p>The Notenki Memoirs is written by one of the co-founders of Gainax, Yasuhiro Takeda, and from the way he writes about it, it seems that he's the responsible one of the four main founders.  Originally published in 2002 in Japan, ADV translated and brought this book over in 2005.</p><p>Takeda talks about meeting Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and Shinji Higuchi in college, and forming an Anime club.  Together they, and a couple other members, worked on an opening animation for the upcoming Sci Fi convention being held in Osaka that year, Daicon III.  The year was 1981.</p><p>The way he talks and reminiscences about their work on Daicon III reminds me of my own time in college in my own anime club, SPAMM, as we worked on a film of our own, The Secret of Crystania (which is really a fandub, not a complete original work).  And much like both of our projects, they were finished only an hour or two before it aired to the public.</p><p>You can view the whole short film on Youtube, as well as the amazing sequel, Daicon IV, that they did 2 years later.</p><p>Daicon III : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c</a><br/>Daicon IV : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE</a></p><p>With the completion of Daicon IV, they founded Daicon Film which specialized in special effects and animation. Later on, the special effects business splintered off, and the remnants became <b>Gainax</b>. In the beginning, the mostly did animation work for Sunrise (Gundam), but later created original works that I mentioned above.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway...</b></div><p>The Gainax Interviews looks like a fascinating read into the history of my favorite Anime studio, and I look forward to reading it someday.  It's my goal to someday have enough knowledge of the Japanese language to actually read this thing.  Maybe, at that time, I'll actually work to translate the whole thing since it doesn't seem like a translation exists.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tonoharu" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tonoharu">Tonoharu</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 2, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About a week ago, I was at a JET related event, and one of the other attendees made mention of the following books: Tonoharu.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp"  /></p><p>Tonoharu is a graphic novel series written by a former JET, and is loosely based on his own experiences while teaching abroad for 3 years.  The author, Lars Martinson, taught from 2003 to 2006 in Fukuoka, Japan.  I assume he means Fukuoka prefecture, and not Fukuoka city.  The story is set in the small fictional town of Tonoharu, and mentions its about an hour away from any major city.</p><div class='title'><b>Prologue</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp"  /></p><p>Before we get into the actual story of Tonoharu, Lars starts everything off in the prologue.  These several pages focus on Lars himself as he nears the end of his first year contract.  He reflects on the past 8 months of his stay in Japan, and wonders whether or not to renew.  The life hasn't been what he expected, and he's had several challenges to face he wasn't prepared for.</p><p>I think this section is rather brilliant, because through explaining his own situation, we're also introduced to the actual characters in the book.  He also foreshadowing all the events to happen over the course of the 3 book series as well.  All things I didn't pay attention to at all until I read it a second time.</p><div class='title'><b>Part One</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp"  /></p><p>The main character in Tonoharu is <b>Dan Welles</b>, and he is Lars' predecessor.  The story focuses on Dan's experience teaching abroad.  It begins with Dan meeting his own predecessor, and attending his welcoming party.  It continues with Dan's first classes at his school, and giving his self-introduction class lesson.  And it expands on Dan's character, and introduces several other characters too.</p><p>The story throughout Part One seems like a pretty good introduction to the type of situations one would have when teaching English in Japan's grade school system.  I guess it's implied that Dan is in the JET Programme, but it's never directly referenced.  Also, given that Lars' started JET in 2003, I'm assuming that this is supposed to take place in 2002.  I'm not sure why Dan doesn't have a cellphone, or why he never researches anything on a computer.  This ain't the 90s.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp"  /></p><p>Dan is a completely fictional character.  Well... at least, I really hope he's completely fictional.  Dan is an unconfident unprepared unmotivated person.  He doesn't seem to have any hobbies, or desires, or any real personality.  He kind of acts like some people I used to know...</p><p>At first, I figured the guy was just shy.  I consider myself a little bit shy, so I can relate, and being thrown into certain situations can make me very nervous, and seemingly uninteresting, or boring, or whatever.  So, at the beginning, I figured Dan was just adjusting to the new culture and taking things slow.</p><p>But he never pulls himself out of this rut.  I don't think he's too afraid to branch out, he just doesn't know how to.  I guess he does try asking people about what things to do, and he tries to make friends with people...  and they all blow him off.  But he just stops at that point.  He feels like all of his avenues are cut off, so he doesn't know how to take care of himself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp"  /></p><p>...and as such, he gets even more depressed.</p><p>This guy is basically the Charlie Brown of the JET Programme.  Nothing seems to go his way, and he keeps taking all the shit that life gives him.</p><div class='title'><b>Part Two</b></div><p>Part Two represents a bit of a change for the series.  It still focuses on Dan, and his incredible unmotivated depression, but expands on all the characters introduced in Part One.  In fact, I think Lars spends way too much time on the character interactions that the uniqueness of this taking place in Japan seems to fade away.  I guess that could represent that over time all the things that seem unique and interesting become normal and mundane because you're used to them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp"  /></p><p>But he's really building a story.  I think the down to earth nature of the comic is absolutely it's strong point, he really needs a story, and I think that's when the fictiveness of the entire series starts breaking the reality a bit.  Now we have the kooky rich europeans that the whole town hates.  And the stereotypical "playboy" who sleeps with all kinds of women.  And a love interest too! though that trope felt very natural in its execution.</p><p>Overall, I think it's still very good.  And the art is really unique too.  It's very simple and straightforward like a typical newspaper comic, but has an incredible amount of detail and complexity when it needs it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Part Three</b></div><p>This is a 3 part graphic novel series, and, at the moment, only two volumes have been finished.  He's definitely working on the final book of the series.  In a semi-recent <a href="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/" title="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/">blog post</a> he mentions that he's a third of the way complete!</p><p>Also, reading through Lars' blog, it seems that he's back in Japan again, and he's been writing a web comic series about his current misadventures entitled the <b>Kameoka Dairies</b>.  This series is much more direct about specific subjects he's come across from daily life in Japan, rather than building an all encompassing story.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>This series does feel a bit negative about the experiences one might have when teaching English in Japan, but after taking a hard look at the main character, it feels like he's done this to himself.  If you're active, know how to ask questions, and have motivation to get the most out of life, I don't think you'd have as rough a time as our pal Dan did.</p><p>I think if you've ever been in JET, or are interested in joining JET, this book series is a must read.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Before Watchmen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/before-watchmen">Before Watchmen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 24, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Starting at the beginning of June, DC Comics has finally begun releasing the much talked and debated about comic book series, <b>Before Watchmen</b>.  After the massive success of the 2009 film adaptation of The Watchmen, DC began thinking about ways it could further monetize the series with the surge of new fans.  I didn't even realize these comics were finally out until I visited my local comic book store.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp"  /></p><p>Before Watchmen is a series of 7 separate comic book series where each series focuses on a single character from The Watchmen, except the comic series, The Minutemen, which focuses solely on the original group of masked vigilantes that preceded The Watchmen.  Each comic explains the origins or motives behind the character leading into the story of The Watchmen itself.</p><p>The idea is that a new comic will come out each week from June until January.  You can find the schedule from this website <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035" title="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035">here</a>.  The Minutemen, Ozymandias, and The Comedian all are 6 issues series, whereas the other 4, Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, and Rorschach are all 4 issues series.  All in all, there are 34 issues, and plus an extra 48-page one shot to tie everything together at the end.  We are 3 weeks into June, and as such, there have only been 3 issues released so far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Controversy</b></div><p>The most vocal person against the idea of more Watchmen comics is one of the creators, <b>Alan Moore</b>.  In 2009, just as DC was about the launch the movie, Alan Moore spoke out about how this film was nothing more than a money making scheme.  DC had run out of ideas, and the only way to make money was to take projects with integrity that stand on their own, and somehow cash them in.  He even refused to accept any royalties he would've received from the creation of the film.</p><p>In that case, I think any complaints he had about the idea of a film were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming positive praise of the film's execution.  For years, people said you couldn't do a Watchmen movie because it was too complicated, but Zack Snyder pulled it off, in my opinion and many others.  It was fantastic, and (mostly) stuck strictly to the script of the comic.</p><p>Alan Moore is back again in the spotlight as a HUGE dissenter of Before Watchmen.  A few years after the original comic of The Watchmen was finished in the 1980s, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons were thinking about how they might expand the series.  They thought about having a story focus on each character, but didn't really think it would work.  They really wanted to do a full story about The Minutemen, though, but DC weren't interested at the time.  For years, DC shot down any ideas Alan Moore brought up about a revival of The Watchmen, and created some rather bad blood between the two.</p><p>So when, DC finally came back to Alan Moore about expanding The Watchmen in the mid-2000s (citation needed), Alan Moore refused.  And he has been incredibly against the idea of Watchmen revival ever since.</p><p>So, the actual <b>controversy</b> of these books is "will they actually live up to the original comics."  Is this just another ploy for cash they will ultimately cheapen The Watchmen franchise.  Or are these new books actually just?  Are these worthwhile reads, and important to the overall story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Minutemen #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp"  /></p><p>For The Minutemen, I think this issue matches the expectations.  It focuses on the development of The Minutemen as a group, framed in Hollis writing his novel.  It introduces all the characters, their psyche, motives, and personalities, and ends on the catalyst that brings them all together.</p><p>While I'm not a huge fan of the art in the original comic, I can definitely respect the art in The Minutemen.  It's carefully constructed in such a way you feel like you're reading the original.  The dialogue is set up the same.  The art is the same.  And the flow of the comic is exactly the same too.  It's a new Watchmen comic.  All the pieces are there.  And the story is pretty solid so far.</p><p>I think it's pretty good :)</p><div class='title'><b>Silk Spectre #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp"  /></p><p>On the other hand, we have Silk Spectre.  The art does not mimic the original, and neither does the story telling.  It's a completely new comic.  And I think this is what Alan Moore was afraid of.</p><p>Silk Spectre #1 tells the story of Silk Spectre II in high school, and her first romance.  As indicated by the second photo, occasionally a panel will have a Chibi version of the character expressing an inner emotion.  The type of thing you'd find in a comic designed for girls.</p><p>Also, the story is a typical high school girl rebel story of falling in love, and doing anything to be with that unrequited love.  Romeo and Juliet, and so forth.  Another easy stereotypical plot device often used in story designed for girls.</p><p>So, Silk Spectre #1 is pretty dumb, and shameless.  It's specifically trying to pull in the female audience through the ONE female character in the story.  Ohhh, since she's female she's gotta have a high school love story.  And she's a tomboy, so all the other girls make fun of her.  Blah blah blah... it's so cliche.</p><p>But I do like how the comic has its own identity.  This is Silk Spectre's story, and it's completely framed using her personality.  The art is different and unique compared to the other comic, and so is the story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Comedian #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp"  /></p><p>The Comedian follows the same suit.  It's written and drawn by different people, so it has a look and feel and storytelling style of its own.</p><p>The story of the comedian so far is a bit boring.  But it's building to something quite a bit larger.  In the beginning of the comic, Eddie Blake is playing football with John F Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy on the White House lawn.  It establishes that they're all very good friends, and they know each other pretty well.</p><p><b>Spoilers</b>, but at the end of Issue #1, Eddie corners Moloch, and Moloch shows Eddie the TV.  JFK has been fatally shot.  Eddie is surprised and shocked, and looks for the nearest amount of alcohol to calm himself.</p><p>Do you remember the slide show at the beginning of The Watchmen film when it goes through the background stories of The Minutemen, and formation of The Watchmen?  There's a scene that shows Eddie Blake as the second gunman behind the grassy knoll during the assassination of JFK.</p><p>So, if that was canon, why would he be surprised when hearing about the assassination from Moloch?  This doesn't seem to make sense.  Though, this might've been something they just added in the movie, and it's not actually canon with the book.  But I don't think Zack Snyder was adding in random shit at the beginning.</p><p>I'm curious to see how this continues.</p><div class='title'><b>More to come!</b></div><p>Looking at <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035" title="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035">the schedule</a> once again, Comedian #6 is one of the final comics to be released, along with Ozymandias and The Minutemen.  It feels like those are the 3 PRIME story driven comics out of all of these.</p><p>I mean, who really cares about Silk Spectre when she's not around Dr. Manhattan or Nite Owl.  I want to know more about The Minutemen, and the pure motives behind Ozymandias' overall deceit.  Though, I'm sure Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach's stories will be very entertaining on their own.</p><p>Anyways, a new Watchmen comic every week for the next 7 months?  Hell yeah, why not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Invisible Monsters Remix" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/invisible-monsters-remix">Invisible Monsters Remix</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 13, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Monday, Chuck Palahniuk released his newest book Invisible Monsters Remix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp"  /></p><p>This is an enhanced re-release of his third published novel originally released in 1999.  Despite being his third published, it was actually the first full novel Palahniuk had ever written.  He originally shopped it around to publishers, but they didn't like the characters, and thought the story was over the top.  He wrote Fight Club as a response to their rejections, and it became his first published novel.</p><p>After Fight Club and Survivor, Palahniuk had a successful track record with his publisher, and they gave the go ahead for Invisible Monsters.  It had been years since he had written the book, and he felt disingenuous releasing a full-fledged hardcover edition, so it was only ever released in paperback form. It was his only book to not have a hardcover edition.</p><p>Fans have been requesting and petitioning Chuck for a hardcover version of the book, and this week they finally got it.  And it has a lot more, too.  The original book has 27 chapters of linear story, while Remix has 42 chapters of non-linear story.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp"  /></p><p>Chuck wanted to book to have the feeling of a magazine.  Most magazines break up their articles with the first couple of paragraphs in the front of the book, and dump the rest of the text near the back.  You can start the book anywhere you want.  And if you like what you're reading, continue to the next linear chapter, otherwise just continue to the next numerical chapter.</p><p>After skimming through the book, I noticed that the original Chapter 1 of Invisible Monsters is Chapter 41 in the Remix version, and the final chapter, 27, is now Chapter 21.  The image above is from the end of Chapter 41 in remix.  Even though, Chapter 1 has a nice start of its own, you'd be missing a single chapter in the whole story if you start there.</p><p>Also some chapters have mirrored text for some reason.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp"  /></p><p>In typical geek fashion, I ordered my copy through St. Helens Bookstore, which is Palahniuk's favorite local bookstore.  Leading up to the release of any of his books, he'll sign all copies pre-ordered through that venue.  These are the same types of signatures you can find in the books when he tours around the country promoting them.  But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he only toured to 4 cities, all on the west coast, so these signed books might be more scarce than his others.</p><p>Also, scattered throughout the book is random party glitter, some red stamped kisses, and "postcards from hell" promos for his newest novel, Damned, released last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp"  /></p><p>I look forward to reading this one again.  Especially since I barely remember anything that happened in the book.  His first five novels all seem to follow a predictable formula.  There's always 3 major characters: the narrator, the friend, and the love interest.  There tends to be more character than that, but there's always these 3.  All 3 of them tend to suffer from some kind of mental or physical illness, and eventually one of them dies.</p><p>All 5 of his original novels have them same tone as well.  It's very dark, and gritty, and nihilistic with amazing detail into mundane activities.  Calculative, efficient, and professional, but with a distance from reality and society.  That's what really drew me to Palahniuk in the first place.  His writing style is so visceral and atmospheric that I can lose myself in his story, and place myself in the character.</p><p>Over the years, he's tried to do things a bit different and break away from the molds he created.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I think Rant and Pygmy captured some of his original magic, but some of his other novels have fallen flat with me.  Snuff and Tell-All in particular were ones that I could not relate to at all.  I still haven't read Damned yet. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp"  /></p><p>But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he's up to 15 published books, and he has the two sequels to Damned yet to finish and publish.  He works pretty damn hard.  Each year, he has a new book published, so there's plenty material for his fans.  His website, chuckpalahniuk.net, has monthly writing workshops, so it's not too difficult to get into contact with him, and all of his fanbase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chuck Palahniuk's Damned Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-damned-tour">Chuck Palahniuk's Damned Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight, I was in Minneapolis for Chuck Palahniuk's second to last stop on his tour promoting his newest novel, <b>Damned</b>.  Damned is about a 13 year old girl, named Madison, who dies.  And she must accept the fact that she's dead, and goes through the grieving process.  Damned is the first book in a triology.  The following 2 books are still in process and titled <b>Doomed</b> and <b>Delivered</b>.  Apparently she goes from hell (Damned) to purgatory (Doomed) to heaven (Delivered).</p><p>I haven't had a chance to read Damned just yet, but it seems that Chuck and Double Day are promoting Damned much more than his other recent novels.  Perhaps that's because it's a series of books and they need to start strong.  Chuck has done interviews in many of the popular and niche magazines out there.  Including in an article for Minneapolis' own premiere newspaper, The Star Tribune.</p><p>My Mom was kind enough to clip the whole 2 page spread out of The Star Tribune for me.  Thanks Mom. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp"  /></p><p>The article was printed on Sunday November 6th, and was written by Star Tribune's art editor, Claude Peck.  You can probably find it on The Star Tribune dot com.  (edit: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/133204103.html" title="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/133204103.html">Here it is</a>).</p><p>Tonight's event for Chuck Palahniuk wasn't just another stop on the tour, but was part of a series of interviews with high-profile authors of our time.  The Star Tribune and Minnesota Public Radio collaborated on this series entitled <b>Talking Volumes</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Talking Volumes</b></div><p>Talking Volumes is held in downtown St. Paul at the historic Fitzgerald Theater, which is apparently the oldest theater in the Twin Cities (citation needed).  We got there around 5:30pm, and stood outside in line for a little while.  Upon entering the theater, we were given a program was reprinting the entire Star Tribune article in a much more focused format.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp"  /></p><p>To start off the evening, a woman came up on stage and gave an introduction to the events for the evening.  She give a quick rundown of MPR, and asked for donations (of course).  She brought Claude Peck to the stage, and asked him a few quick questions about the Star Tribune article.  Peck had flown out to Chuck's home in Portland, Oregon several weeks ago to do this "exclusive" interview, and were able to get some nice, current photos of Chuck in the process.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp"  /></p><p>And with that the woman introduced Kerri Miller.  Miller is the host of Talking Volumes, and a few other programs on MPR.  She's been in broadcasting since 1981, and used to be on KARE-11 news in Minneapolis before joining MPR in 2004.  She started off with a short introduction, and welcomed Chuck to the stage.</p><div class='title'><b>Interview</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp"  /></p><p>The interview was rather interesting and a little unorthodox.  Miller had a series of prepared questions, but would not disclose them with Chuck.  I'm guessing this is because they didn't want some prepared statement, or marketing answer for each question, but wanted the interview to be an actual interview.  This didn't really go over so well with Chuck.</p><p>For the first few questions, he had to pause for a moment to form the answer in his head.  I don't think that's because he didn't have an answer, but because he wanted to form the answer into something entertaining, funny, or memorable.  After a few answers like this, Miller asks why he felt the need to do this.  Chuck took no time in answering this one.</p><p>It was to put on a show, obviously.  When trying to be funny, or shocking, or memorable, the audience reaction is a clear sign that things are either going right, or wrong.  And having the chance to prepare, gives the opportunity to make the answers pop and excite.  Having to think up entertaining answers on the fly is difficult for anyone. And most of his answers came in the form of a story, or anecdote.  Some stories of which I had heard before.</p><p>She did ask some good questions though, and some of them got down to the fundamental themes brought forth in <b>Damned</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Death and Damned</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp"  /></p><p>Leading into the Summer of 2008, Chuck had just released <b>Snuff</b>, and was on tour promoting it.  I caught him in Minneapolis that time too!  Check it out = <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">May 27th, 2008</a>.</p><p>He mentioned that Snuff was the first of faux "trilogy" he had written during the previous year while his mother laid in the hospital.  He visited her constantly, and while in her hospital room, he would write.  And what came out of that was Snuff, Pygmy, and Tell-All.  Each of these books were very research focused, and seemed like flushed out short stories.</p><p>In the Fall of 2008, the film based on his novel Choke was released in theaters, and he was up and about again with promoting the film.  Chuck mentioned that he had this very odd juxtaposition of promoting a movie about a Son visiting his dying mother in the hospital, while doing this exact same thing with his own mother in his personal life.  He kept all this somewhat private, at the time.  Shortly after the Choke was release, his mother passed away.</p><p><b>Damned</b> is a trilogy for him strictly dealing with the death of his mother, and the death of his father from 12 years ago.  He mentioned that writing a novel about a 49 year old man, dealing with the death of his parents is way too sad.  So he completely switched the situation to be a young girl dealing with her own death, and missing her parents, her friends, her life.  She's mourning herself, in the same way others would mourn the loss of her.  And she mourns the loss of her parents, because she's dead.</p><p>Damned sounds much more down to earth than his previous couple of novels.</p><div class='title'><b>Being Clever</b></div><p>The night was split up into 3 segments, with each one broken up by a musical break by surf rock band, The Bombay Sweets.  The first two segments were strictly for the interview, and each segment ended with Chuck reading an excerpt from Damned.  For the third segment, Miller opened the floor to questions from  the audience.</p><p>I think Chuck responded to the audience questions with much more enthusiasm than he did with any of the questions by Miller.</p><p>One question was about the scene in the <b>Fight Club</b> film, when Brad Pitt first meets Edward Norton on the airplane.  They have a little conversation, and Norton explains his whole single serving theory of travel.  Brat Pitt replies, "That's clever."  Norton returns, "Thank You."  Pitt continues, "How's that working out for?" Norton , "What?"  Pitt, "Being clever."</p><p>The question was how did he come up with that dialogue, and was there a story behind it.  Chuck professed that it was actually Brad Pitt that came up with that line during filming, and he had nothing to do with it.  But Chuck added to the answer by saying that being witty and clever can really only get you so far.  Witty and Clever are good ways of getting in the door, but you need something more to really hook your audience.</p><p>You need to create something memorable.  Not necessarily something that audience will like, but something that will make an impact. If something impactful happens to you, whether you like it or not, several months or years down the road, it will still be with you.  And at that time, you'll respond to it favorably.  You'll like it then.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Obedient, The Rebel, The Witness</b></div><p>Another question that was asked had Chuck talking about a very common literary and story telling/writing pattern that emerged in the 20th century.   The idea of the Obedient, the Rebel, and the Witness.</p><p><b>The Obedient</b> is a person who follows the rules perfectly. Society has told them that if you follow these rules, all of your desires will come true. Get good grades in School. Listen to their teachers. Graduate. Go to college. Get a degree. Get a job. Get married. Have kids.  Et cetera.</p><p>Everyone my age was subliminally told this as a child.  And that is how I've followed my life for the most part.  And it's worked out pretty well for me.  It doesn't really work out this way for everyone, though.</p><p>Following this pattern will eventually lead to self-destruction.  In many of these stories, this person is seen as the Martyr.  They do everything in their life "perfectly", but it's not true.  It's not perfect.  And then they fall.  In real life, they fall into the next archetype.</p><p><b>The Rebel</b> is the complete opposite.  They reject everything society has taught them, and follow their own rules.  They feel that society has failed them, or that society has nothing to offer them, or that society is a fraud.  In stories, this person is eventually killed by society.  It's impossible (not really) to live outside of the system, and that system will eventually roll over them, and reject them.</p><p>Most Obedient people will turn rebel when their hopes and dreams are dashed by following the rules.  "The system lied to me."  In our lives, we usually glide back and forth between the two extremes.  We don't like to live in the system, but the system is there for a reason, and it's comfortable.  But FUCK the system.</p><p>The point directly between the Obedient and the Rebel is <b>the Witness</b>.  They are the person who has seen both ends of the spectrum.  They take this knowledge with them.  They are wise because of it, and can guide others through their life.</p><p>Chuck gave some examples of this story telling pattern being used.  Stories such as Gone with the Wind, and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.  In One Flew, Billy Bibbit is the Obedient, McMurphy is the Rebel, and Big Chief is the Witness.</p><p>Chuck mentioned that he incorporated this pattern in <b>Fight Club</b>, but put all these roles in a single character.  The Narrator is the Obedient.  Tyler Durden is the Rebel.  And both of characters types are eventually killed, leaving the Narrator as the Witness.  Marla is possibly the Witness, too.</p><div class='title'><b>End of Interview</b></div><p>At the end of the Interview, Chuck had a little contest to see who could blow up Inflatable pumpkins the fastest and knock them into the sky.  So, the whole theater inflated these things, and started punching them around the place.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp"  /></p><p>The interview was recorded, and will air on MPR sometime in the next week, I'm guessing.  It was video recorded too, so be sure to check out MPR's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MPRdotOrg" title="http://www.youtube.com/user/MPRdotOrg">Youtube channel</a> for updates on that.</p><p>I came away from the night with a pre-signed copy of Damned, which included several "Postcards from hell" stuffed in the pages, and one of those inflatable pumpkins, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp"  /></p><p>It was a pretty damn spiffy night.  I learned a couple of things, and had a good time.  I brought along my little sister, and her husband to enjoy the night with me, and they had a great time too. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Song of Ice and Fire" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/song-of-ice-and-fire">Song of Ice and Fire</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hurrah!  Today is A Dance with Dragons day.  Almost 5 years ago, George R. R. Martin released the 4th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Feast for Crows, saying that originally it was too long!  A Feast for Crows was split into two books, and the next one should be out fairly soon.  5 years, all the fantasy nerds waited and waited and waited.  While it did take longer, the day is finally here.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp"  /></p><p>And Fuck me this book is huge.</p><p>As mentioned in my article a few days ago (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here!</a>), I finally started reading A Song of Ice and Fire as recommended to me by numerous friends,Â colleagues, and other random people.  And I've made the joke several times that each book in the series I read becomes the longest book I've ever read.  This is literally the case.</p><p>A Game of Thrones -- ~700 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Clash of Kings -- ~750 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Storm of Swords -- ~975 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Feast for Crows -- ~750 pages (hardcover)</p><p>I've only made it to A Storm of Swords at the moment.  I'm looking forward to A Feast of Crows which finally breaks the damn cycle.  But again...  Fuck me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp"  /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons -- 1040 pages (hardcover)</p><p>While these books have been described as addictive page turners, I find myself incredibly exhausted.  SO exhausted.  All the novels and books I've read before have been around the 200 or 250 park mark, with one or two hitting 300.  The last time I had a reading binge, I think I read 7 or 8 books before my motivation began to die.  Given that I'm almost 200 pages into A Storm of Swords after finishing the first two books, I think I've hit my limit :(</p><p>These books just keep going on and on and on and on.  There are two main stylistic choices that George R. R. Martin has chosen for A Song of Ice and Fire, and he is utterly stuck with these choices.</p><div class='title'><b>Character Focused Chapters</b></div><p>At first, A Song of Ice and Fire is written in third person.  Each chapter is named after a character in the story, and each chapter focuses on specific events surrounding that character.  As the story progresses, the third person take becomes more of a first person perspective written in third person.</p><p>This is good for me, as I have difficultly establishing connections to characters when everything is written in third person.  A first person story gives me information about the character's thoughts behind the action, and allows me to understand why the character is doing what they're doing.  A Song of Ice and Fire goes to great lengths to make this possible, but in the third person writing style.</p><p>A Game of Thrones is a fantastic book where things happens in one character's perspective, and then the view changes to another character and you get the other side of the story.  You get all (most) sides of the story and begin to understand that there are no villians in the story.  Each character has their motivation, and are completely consistent in what they do.  It all makes sense.</p><p>This style works well when all the characters occupy the same space.  But, it falls apart in the second and third novels when all the chapter-characters are separated, and all have their own plots.  While A Clash of Kings does have an overall plot, several characters are not participating in that plot.  Main characters are now side characters.  ...but they're still treated as main characters since they have their own chapters.  Each chapter begs for my attention, but so much of what's going on doesn't really matter.  My interest is split up into 7 or 8 concurrent storylines going on at once.</p><p>This is why I'm getting exhausted by these books.</p><div class='title'><b>Flashbacks</b></div><p>Flashbacks are good, but they aren't so good when they're used to play catch-up.  Unfortunately, while I'm reading about one character's plot, shit is still going on in the world to the other characters.  So how do we make up for this?  Start off a character's chapter with a flashback explaining what they were doing while you were reading about the other characters.</p><p>That's really what I was going for with my previous post (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here, again!</a>).  It's hard to advance the story of a character when you have to make up for all time you missed covering the other characters.  The present timeline of the chapter seems to hang there.  The story usually catches up halfway through the chapter, THEN we can doing stuff in present time.</p><p>While it IS annoying, It's pretty seemless how he integrates most flashbacks into the character's chapters.  But overall, it really seems like a side-effect to doing character focused chapters to begin with.  I think the suggestion I've heard the most from people complaing about this is that he should've just made a book all about Bran.  Then a book about Arya.  Then so on and on and on.  But TOO LATE, you're stuck with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Reading... ugh</b></div><p>Looking at my numbers above, there are 4215 pages to Song of Ice and Fire (at the moment).  And I've read about 1650 of them.  Nearly 40%!  I'll try to continue reading, especially now that my friends and colleagues have started diving into the new book.  But I don't think I can handle more than 100 pages a week.  Maybe I should start skipping certain chapters, and just read the cliff notes online...</p><p>Happy Dance with Dragons day, everyone!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Nook of Color" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color">A Nook of Color</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>"Excuse me, do you mind if I ask you which one that is?"</p><p>Everyday, busses enter Capitol Square in Madison, WI.  It's really the hub of all bus traffic in the city.  Whether they begin their journey there, or simply pass through is a matter of route.  Most busses arrive early, and must wait until their scheduled departure time.</p><p>Jim Hendricks waits at this bus stop every morning.  He walks from his apartment down the road, then waits for his bus to arrive.  This morning was really no different than any other.  The bus arrived on time and he boarded.</p><p>"It's a Nook Color", Jim replied.</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"A Nook Color," Jim replied again.  "From Barnes &amp; Noble."</p><p>"Ah yes...", the old man finally realized.</p><p>Today was a little different.  Someone on the bus actually talked to Jim.  Everyday, Jim waits for the bus, he boards, and now recently, he reads.</p><p>A few weeks ago premiered a television program that he was very excited for.  This program is called Game of Thrones.  It is based off of a series of novels that his college friends Tony of Gregerson and Erika of then Lamm, but now of Aho had implored him to read.  These friends were of like minds and tastes to Jim, and these books had captured their hearts.</p><p>"Game of Thrones is my favorite fantasy series.  All of his characters are rich, and his story doesn't care for them at all.  He kills of characters on a whim.  The story is brutal.  And you'd love it,"  Tony had stated.</p><p>"Yeah, Jim.  You should read them," Erika reinforced.</p><p>"I'm sure they're fantastic, but these books look really really long, and reading is boring," the young and naive Jim had replied to their recommendations.</p><p>It was 6 months and 5 years ago that Tony, in a further effort to expose Jim to these fantastic novels, had invited him to Madison.  The author, George R. R. Martin, had recently published A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in the series, and was on a book tour stretching from the salty seas of the Pacific to the Atlantic.  It was here that Jim met GRRM, shook his hand, purchased his books, and had them autographed.</p><p>But Jim was stubborn, and engulfed in course work at the time.  His stubbornness persisted even after university was completed, and began work in the midwestern city of Madison.  Many of his collegues had read the works, and shared their recommendations.  <em>Man, everyone loves these books.</em> But it was only until he saw the televised product that he began to head their words.  He and his friends watched in splendor as the distinct characters and vivid environments came to life.  After a few episodes, they were hooked.  They were fans.  And it was lucky that Jim owned the novels, so they all could read how it was originally wrote.</p><p>After 5 episodes had aired, Jim started reading Game of Thrones.  He had been discussing the program with Chris of Schroeder at his office.  <em>This show is pretty damn awesome, but there is a lot going on.  I really wonder how much of this stays true to the books.</em> So he read.  For the first time, in a long time, he read.  And of the recommendations, they were all justified.  For he did like the books.</p><p>"I really like it.  I bought it mostly for a vacation, and I've been using it quite a lot since then," he continued to reply to the old's man question on the bus.</p><p>Reading the novels had been great at first, but his yearly vacation across the seas to the volcanic Islands of Japan had drawn near.  He had a mere 200 pages remaining in Game of Thrones which he could surely finish given several hours.  <em>I'm just about done with this book, but I don't have to time before I leave.  I can't bring both books with.  They take up too much space.</em></p><p>He recalled a coversation he had with Lady Kait of Stites a week or two prior.  Though, he didn't recall the conversation perfectly as it had been at a bar, and Jim drinks many beers when he's at a bar.  He thinks this conversation was born out of talking about the band they at the bar to see.</p><p>"I find it odd how much I've completely switched to digital music.  I still feel like I'm one of those people who enjoys owning a physical copy of something.  But, ever since I bought this iPhone, I've stopped buying physical copies of music.  Almost everything is digital.  The only physical copies of music I purchase is Vinyl, as I feel that's the ultimate physical representation of music these days."</p><p>"Ya know, maybe books are the same way.  Having a first edition hardcover copy of book, is like having a vinyl copy of a vintage album.  And there are many books I don't care about but still want to read.  Maybe buying an ereader makes sense for those titles.  And portability too.  I'm going on vacation rather soon, and can't hulk around those mamoth tombs with me everywhere.  It makes sense to buy one of those things."</p><p>"Yeah, I could see that," Kait had replied, though probably just to humor him, as he was talking about boring things.  She smiled, and they went back to listening to the band.</p><p>A few days later, he found himself in Barnes &amp; Noble.  He was interested in the Nook Color above other ereaders for 3 key reasons.  The first was because of his hatred for e-ink.  e-ink was monotone and had an annoying lag between turning pages.  The second point had been it's OS built on Android.  There were several articles on tech blogs saying how easy it was to jailbreak the device, and find yourself with a full Android tablet.  Unlocked, it would be able to read any file format, read emails, looks at maps, translate Japanese.  The third point was the most important given the second point, the price.  It was only $250 for a easy-to-unlock tablet device designed as an ereader that could do much more.  After an hour of looking it over, and playing with it, he bought it.</p><p>He finished A Game of Thrones in transit to vacation.  Before returning from vacation, he was able to read over half of the second novel, The Clash of Kings.  Along with those novels, he packed several maps, an itinerary, a shopping list, and a Japanese dictionary on his Nook Color, and they were very helpful.  For this, he was grateful.</p><p>Back on the bus he relayed all of this information to the old man.  "So you can do a whole lot with it," the old man replied after a second of digesting what was just said.  Perhaps Jim had said too much information, and was probably boring people again.  They went back into silence.  Jim turned back to the Nook Color to continue reading.</p><p>He has started the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords and intends to read them all.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pygmy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pygmy">Pygmy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It debuted as number 3 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html">New York Times Best Seller List</a>.</p><p>For his latest novel, he kept his book tour brief.  He toured only 6 or 7 cities, none of which were in the Midwest.  It's unfortunate, but he did tour twice last year, once for his 9th novel "Snuff" and for "Choke", the film adaption of his 4th novel.  I caught his "Snuff" tour last year: <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">http://theschlock.com/blog/?p=452</a>.</p><p>Much like last year, he announced his next novel.  Next year, Chuck will release his 11th novel entitled "Tell All".  He also mentioned that while caring for his mother last year, he wrote 3 novels, so there's still plenty Chuck down the pipeline.  You can read more about it at <a href="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all" title="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all">The Cult</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>St. Helens Book Shop</b></div><p>Even though, I missed him touring, I did purchase a signed first edition of Pygmy from St. Helens Book Shop.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp"  /></p><p>St. Helens Book Shop is Chuck Palahniuk's local book store near Portland, Oregon.  Whenever he's back in town he'll stop by and sign copies of most of his books that they have in stock.  For Pygmy, if you pre-ordered the book through them, Chuck would be in the store the weekend before the book shipped and sign all of their Pre-order editions.  So, that's what I did.  It also has a bunch of tour stamps on it, too.</p><p>This isn't limited to Pygmy or new releases. You can get any Chuck Palahniuk book they have in stock signed or even personalized if you wish.  Which is great, since Chuck Palahniuk tours have attracted some large crowds and no longer has the time to sign everyone's books because of the demand.</p><p>If you're interested check out <a href="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors" title="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors">St. Helens Book Shop</a>. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Pygmy</b></div><p>Anyways, I just finished reading Pygmy this afternoon on the bus ride home.</p><p>Pygmy is about a foreign exchange student living in America whose actually an undercover terrorist.  He and his fellow foreign classmates have been tasked to carry out Operation Havoc.  To take down and destroy our lazy American country.  It's a comedy and a romance!</p><p>The number one thing I love about Chuck Palahniuk's writing is how easy they are to read.  It's the reason that kept me reading after Fight Club.  Unfortunately, this book was not an easy read for me.  Pygmy is written from the perspective of the foreign exchange student, so it's ALL broken English.</p><p>That's a feat of its own.  Writing and consistently writing broken English must've driven him insane.  It's daunting at times to read it, but I couldn't imagine writing like this.</p><p>The text itself is pretty funny.  And conveying how odd our society is to a more traditional culture is also pretty hilarious.  But it is exhausting to read.  I finished the book today, and I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of some the characters were.  The broken English is really a crutch that keeps me from enjoying the book at times.</p><div class='title'><b>Variety</b></div><p>But I can hardly condemn the writing style because it's really an adventurous experiment and brings a new dimension to understanding the main character.  Pygmy himself tries to understand America and communication intentions, but they fall flat amongst the American characters in the book.  He brings the misunderstanding back into his own text as he accounts what happened that day.</p><p>Pygmy is incredibly unique.  I'd say it's Chuck's most unique novel yet.  Since Diary, he's really been experimenting with different ways of telling and developing his stories.  Diary was written from the point of someone in a Coma throughout the book.  Haunted contained short stories written by each character involved in a murder scheme.  Rant was from all points of view except the main character.  Snuff focused on 4 main characters who had there own views on the 5th main character.</p><p>His first 5 novels were so similar in style.  It's incredibly interesting to see just how far away from that he's willing to go.  Pygmy is really his first novel since then that was completely written from the main character's perspective and half the time you don't even know what's going on!</p><div class='title'><b>Not Bad</b></div><p>I'd definitely recommend Pygmy if you're interested in reading something you aren't used to.  Even though the writing is a bit different for Chuck, there are still plenty of themes and events that scream his story writing style. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Choke" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/choke">Choke</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year has been fantastic for movies.  Cloverfield.  Speed Racer.  Dark Knight.  I just got back from my second viewing of Pineapple Express.  Fantastic!  Summer is winding down, though.  The air has become chill.  And all the kids are back in town for college.  The year is not quite over, but there's still one movie left that I eagerly anticipate.  That's <b>Choke</b>.</p><p>9 years ago, <b>Fight Club</b> introduced me to the satirical dark writing of Chuck Palahniuk.  Throughout those 9 years, I've read all his novels, watched Fight Club a billion times, and even seen him in person.  Fight Club made me an instant fan.  It brought my from cinema into novels and even fosters some creative writing from time to time.  I'd probably be playing video games on the bus if not for Fight Club, really.</p><p>Anywho, 9 years later, another of Chuck's books has finally made it to theaters.  Choke opens September 26th in select theaters, but some people have already seen it at various film festivals.  And from what it looks like, there are some haters out there.  The negative reviews seem to have a similar tone... 'It ain't Fight Club'.  Well, it's funny you should mention that...</p><p>Fight Club has a very distinct tone throughout the movie.  It's a very dark dank vision of society and the people around you.  Putting on a polite show for humanity, despite feeling completely empty and emotionless.  Then starting to break out of your shell just a little with growing confidence in yourself as a person.  This distinct thought process is beautifully translated from the book into film.  When I read the novel, I feel like I'm inside the main character's head.  The same way you are in most of the film.</p><p>After I read Fight Club, I went right on to the next book.  I read Survivor, Choke, Lullaby, Invisible Monsters, and Diary.  Each one carried this same tone.  Each novel placed you deep into the main character's thought process, feelings and emotions.  As I read each novel, I felt completely in tune with the main character.  Choke felt very much like Fight Club.  Only a different setting, different character background, different vices.</p><p>3 months ago, I saw Chuck Palahniuk in Minneapolis for the release of his recent novel, Snuff.  During the event, they played the trailer for Choke.  I was excited.  Even more excited than I had been from just being at the event to begin with.</p><p>However, after viewing the trailer, I felt very conflicted.  It was absolutely nothing like how I pictured it in my mind.  As you can see for yourself, the tone is completely comical.  poppy.  funny on the outside.  Complete opposite emotions I felt when reading the book.  Not Like Fight Club.</p><p>So, I watched the trailer and the red band trailer a bunch of times and went back to read the book.  I read the book from the mindset of a comedy movie.  Maybe I just read it wrong?  Perhaps Fight Club was pushing my expectations into the deep dark mood because the movie effected me in such a way.  Maybe this is a strictly comedic book.</p><p>Naw.  The timing is totally off in the book.  The focus is clearly the emotions and thinking of the main character, Victor Mancini.  The little one liner jokes in the trailer are completely moved around to make it a comedy.</p><p>But!  Then again, these are fricken trailers.  Trailers are created by production staff to promote the movie to as wide an audience as possible.  Thinking back to 9 years ago, I thought Fight Club was garbage from the TV spots I saw.  I only saw it later on DVD when my friends made me watch it.  The overall feeling of the book or movie can't be easily illustrated in a 3 minute clip.</p><p>I'm still totally stoked for Choke, though.  I think I'm going into the film with a unique perspective that I have never  had with any movie I've seen before.  I think this'll be the first movie where I've read the book way in advance from the film being announced.  It's exciting to see the movie adaptation clash with my imagination.  For some reason I imagined the characters a lot skinnier...  Especially Paige Marshall.</p><p>4 more weeks!</p><p>Check out both trailers on the <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/" title="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/">Official Site</a>.  The can be a little tricky to find though.  Go to the restricted area, then go to videos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Scanner Darkly" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/scanner-darkly">Scanner Darkly</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today is Sunday, but it's not a normal Sunday.</p><p>I'm on a couch.  No, not my own couch.  I don't even own a couch.  It's a friend's couch and I'm stayed at his apartment last night.  He and I aren't the only ones here either.  Many friends of ours came to visit him.  We went to the massive drinking party known as Irish fest.  As usual, I drank more than my share, but I had a great time.  Drinking and Dancing.  I remember pretty much all of it.  The only part that escapes me where my steps exiting the gates and arriving to the couch.</p><p>But, it's now Sunday.  A very hazy Sunday.</p><p>Waking up is always a chore when your body feels wrecked.  All of us in the room, feel the same, so I'm in equal company.  It puts me in a good mood.  A grand time experienced by us all.  Time is short, though.  My bus back to Madison is in a few hours.  And my ride to the bus time is even sooner.  I shower and pack and off we go.  My friend has a very busy day so he drops me off with a good hour before the bus arrives.  Luckily, there's a Perkins nearby.</p><p>Sunday is a very popular day.  It's the most popular day for Perkins.</p><p>With half an hour before noon, the Perkins is filled with after-Church goers.  Many seniors with their best set of clothes on their old bodies.  Many children in their best Sunday dress or slacks.  Families, both old and young.  And me.  Standing in the entrance-way holding a backpack full of worn clothes and shampoo.  Holding another bag with my computer and other personal belongings.  Alone.  With slightly damp untied hair down past my shoulders.</p><p>Table for one, please...   Jim.</p><p>To the inquisitive population my mouth moves and spews out those words.  My eyes wander to the table of grandmas nearest to me.  Then they dart back across the restaurant to the front counter to catch a name tag.  Kim.  Slowing moving across the assortment of pies and muffins under glass.  I am a bit hungry, but that's way too much sugar for the morning.  That muffin is larger than my fist.</p><p>Should be about a 15 minute wait.</p><p>I figured that would be obvious from the crowds of lightly colored dressed people.  I find a bench and set my things down.  There are three other groups of people waiting beside me in this green and black carpeted foyer area.  Two of these groups are a single couple.  Both young men taking their girlfriends or wives to an early afternoon meal.  The other group could be either couple in 10 or 15 years.  A middle aged father in jeans with a ratty shirt with a Beer logo on it.  A wife with a big blonde pony-tail, jeans and jean-jacket combo holding a generic baby carrier with two screaming children using their mom as an obstacle for whatever game they're playing.  I smile, but inside I can't stop laughing.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>15 minutes later, the half-dead elderly couple had thoroughly scrapped themselves out of a booth for me.  I feign sincerity as they pass by.  I lift up my belongings and follow Kim to a now lonely booth by the window.  Such a waste.  Isn't there a smaller table for just one person?  Am I really expected to fill this 4 person space?  I complain to myself, but say only thanks.  My bags take up all the room next to me.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Quickly, A young short woman greets me.  She's incredibly perky for a Sunday morning.  Morning to me, anyways.  Hi, I reply.  She asks me if I want anything to drink.  Milk, I reply.  She asks me what size.  Large, I reply.  And what would you like to order today, She asks with a smile.  What's with all these questions.  So fast.  I hardly had anytime to look at the menu, let alone think a response.  Can I get a water too, I reply.  Sure thing, do you want a minute or two to look at the menu, She asks with a smile.  Yep, I reply.  And off she goes bouncing around with her blond pony tail swaying from side to side.</p><p>What <i>was</i> up with all those questions?  Do single patrons always know automatically what they wish to order?  Oh geez, I wonder what I was suppose to say...  Well, at least I can figure out what to order before she comes back.  I want an omelet of sorts.  Nothing else really looks as fine to me at this hour.  That's what I'll say when she returns.  And I'll practice it in my head a couple times so it doesn't sound weird.  Ugh, that's weird in of itself.</p><p>I bet that grandma over there think I'm weird.  Why is that gentlemen alone, she must wonder.  She probably asks herself a lot of useless questions like that.</p><p>The cheery waitress returns with my drinks and asks the question I've already answered in my head a couple times now.  I want an omelet of sorts.  What kind of sorts, she inquires.  One with tomatoes, mushrooms, veggies, and these two cheeses.  Splendid, she says with a smile.  You also get a muffin and some breakfast potatoes.  Splendid indeed.  And off she goes to put her scribblings up in the kitchen for the minimum wage chef.</p><p>I don't normally talk that way.  In fact, can I even be sure that really just happened?  Now I don't have anything to stare at with the menu gone.  Perhaps now is the best time to finally that book I've been reading.</p><p>Scanner Darkly</p><p>I've seen the movie before.  I've owned the movie for a while now.  And have watched it several times.  But the book is incredible.  Bob Arctor is truly beside himself in ways that the movie simply did not convey.  He is paranoid and a drug addict.  He feels he's doing the right thing by working for the police and spying on his friends.  His dark dank life is injected with a little good through himself.  But Bob Arctor is also Fred.  The undercover law enforcement officer spying on Bob Arctor and his friends.  What despicable lives they have.</p><p>Bob Arctor continuously takes Substance D as a stress reliver, recreational activity, and... well, just because it's there really.  He's addicted.  And the overuse of Substance D causes his brain to split.  The two hemispheres reveal conflicting information.  One side is Bob Arctor, the depressed drug addicted loser.  The other is Fred, the crappy undercover cop who's really wasting the government's time.</p><p>Reading the book reveals the full picture of Bob Arctor and his friends.  The movie is really just excerptse from the book.  Carefully chosen and edited scenes picture perfect from the text to paint a cohesive story that leaves several details out.  Details that didn't really matter to the story, but gave more insight to Bob Arctor and his growing paranoia.</p><p>I like this book a lot.  The whole 60s/70s lingo is fun too.</p><p>This is the first book written by Philip K Dick I've read, and I plan to continue read more.  But I get the feeling they won't live up to this one.  I'm not really a big fan of Sci Fi novels.  I think Sci Fi novels focus too much on the science fiction of the environment rather than the characters...  and so forth.  I love reading about the characters and what they're thinking during events.</p><p>Here ya go, sweetie.</p><p>Excellent.  Eggs, Veggies and little breakfast potatoes.  I consume them while getting closer to the ending.  The perfect meal for this Sunday.  I get my muffin to go and say Goodbye to the lovely waitress with a handsome tip.  The sun is slightly higher in the sky and I have 30 minutes before the bus arrives.  Through the window, I see the waitress bouncing around from one table to the next.  Across the street, I see my destination.  The bus stop.</p><p>Over the road and across the parking lot to the Goerke's Corner I go.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a
