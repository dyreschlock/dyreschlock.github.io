| April 20, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Coming from English, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages on learn. It's so difficult to learn because nearly every aspect of the language is different. The words, the grammar, the ideas, the culture, and the way Japanese is used all differ from English. </p><p>In fact, the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" title="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">Foreign Service Institute</a> classifies Japanese as a Category IV language, which requires a minimum of 2200 hours of class time (88 weeks of 5-hour daily training) to achieve a General Professional Proficiency level. It is the Institute's high ranking, shared only by Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.</p><p>The best way to learn Japanese, and any language, is to be immersed in the language. Have daily contact with the language, and try to find a balance of using all four or five methods of communicating with a language. These four methods are: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Sometimes, people break speaking into two methods: speaking written or prepared words and speaking your own improvised thoughts. Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing is also the order of difficulty of performing them.</p><div class='title'><b>Listening</b></div><p>By being in Japan, listening becomes a daily routine. However, it can be easy to shut everything out and ignore what it said around you. In your native country listening to your native language, you can hear and understand everything around you. You are part of the public consciousness. In a foreign country with a foreign language, you're no longer able to naturally understand everything. You have to work at it. And work is often exhausting, which makes it easy to tune out others.</p><p>There's a lot to understand, and it's possible that there's some things that you'll never understand. But, as time goes on, you will have the ability to understand some things, and be able to connect dots to understand things. If you get in the habit of tuning out others, you rob yourself of the ability to naturally understand your surroundings. So, don't tune out too much. Make attempts at understanding.</p><p>When you hear common phrases, or sometimes when people talk with you. Try repeating what they say. This may seem stupid, but this is how babies naturally begin to learn languages. Which, also may seem stupid for you. Of course, as adults, we can also learn the rules of the languages and compare them with our own language. The combination of these two things will allow use to learn the language.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>Listening becomes the easiest method of communication in Japan because you have so many passive opportunities to practice. Writing is the most difficult because you are not only outputting what you know of the language, but you have to activity do it to get better at it. It takes the most work and time out of the others.</p><p>Unlike English with its 26 letters (or 52, including both upper and lowercase alphabets), Japanese uses three sets of alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana have 46 characters each. Kanji, on the other hand, has over 10,000. Although, there are hundreds or thousands of kanji that are outdated. High School graduates are expected to know the most common 2,000. The Genki books only go through about 320.</p><p>All three of these alphabets are used together. Take a look at this sentence:</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span></p></p><p>The first two characters are <span class='ja'>ジム</span>, katakana. Katakana is almost exclusively used for foreign words in the Japanese language. Both Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, so each of the characters have specific sounds that are said the exact same way wherever they are in the sentence, with a few exceptions. <span class='ja'>ジム</span> is my name, Jim, which is phonetically spelled.</p><p>The next two characters are <span class='ja'>先生</span>, kanji. In sentences, kanji are used for solid words, such as Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives. In this sentence, we have 3 words using kanji: <span class='ja'>先生</span>, <span class='ja'>店</span>, and <span class='ja'>行く</span>. <span class='ja'>先生</span> is <i>sensei</i>, or teacher. Combined with my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生</span>, it's used as a suffix to denote that I'm a teacher. Generally, non-casually, when referring to other people, you use a suffix with their name. <span class='ja'>店</span> is <i>mise</i>, or store. And, <span class='ja'>行く</span> is <i>iku</i>, or the verb, to go.</p><p>The other characters in the sentence (<span class='ja'>は</span>, <span class='ja'>に</span>, <span class='ja'>きます</span>) are hiragana. This is getting ahead of ourselves, but they are used in the sentence as particles and a conjugation. Using <span class='ja'>は</span>(wa) after my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生は</span> denotes that I'm the subject of the sentence. Using <span class='ja'>に</span>(ni) with shop <span class='ja'>店に</span> denotes the direction of the action. And, <span class='ja'>行きます</span>(ikimasu) is the present positive conjugation of the verb <span class='ja'>行く</span>, meaning to go.</p><p>Putting the meaning together: Jim goes to the store. (or Mr. Jim goes to the store.)</p><div class='title'><b>Hiragana and Pronunciation</b></div><p>Even though there are three writing systems, both katakana and kanji can be written in hiragana, which is the first alphabet we'll learn. Additionally, every hiragana character can be written in Alphabetic characters, which is where we'll start when learning words. This is called Romaji.</p><p>Let's go back to our sentence.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span><br/><span class='ja'>じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span><br/>jimu-sensei wa mise ni ikimasu</p></p><p>Looking at the sentence in Romaji can help with pronunciation. Each hiragana has a specific sound and pronunciation doesn't change based on spelling as in English. Here's all the Hiragana, with Romaji to the right.</p><p><div class="columns center"><div class="column"><span class='ja'>あ　い　う　え　お</span><br/><span class='ja'>か　き　く　け　こ</span><br/><span class='ja'>さ　し　す　せ　そ</span><br/><span class='ja'>た　ち　つ　て　と</span><br/><span class='ja'>な　に　ぬ　ね　の</span><br/><span class='ja'>は　ひ　ふ　へ　ほ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ま　み　む　め　も</span><br/><span class='ja'>や　　　ゆ　　　よ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ら　り　る　れ　ろ</span><br/><span class='ja'>わ　　　　　　を</span><br/><span class='ja'>ん</span></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">a <span class='ja'>　</span>i <span class='ja'>　</span>u <span class='ja'>　</span>e <span class='ja'>　</span>o<br/>ka<span class='ja'>　</span>ki<span class='ja'>　</span>ku<span class='ja'>　</span>ke<span class='ja'>　</span>ko<br/>sa<span class='ja'>　</span>shi<span class='ja'>　</span>su<span class='ja'>　</span>se<span class='ja'>　</span>so<br/>ta<span class='ja'>　</span>chi<span class='ja'>　</span>tsu<span class='ja'>　</span>te<span class='ja'>　</span>to<br/>na<span class='ja'>　</span>ni<span class='ja'>　</span>nu<span class='ja'>　</span>ne<span class='ja'>　</span>no<br/>ha<span class='ja'>　</span>hi<span class='ja'>　</span>fu<span class='ja'>　</span>he<span class='ja'>　</span>ho<br/>ma mi mu me mo<br/>ya<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yu<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yo<br/>ra<span class='ja'>　</span>ri<span class='ja'>　</span>ru<span class='ja'>　</span>re<span class='ja'>　</span>ro<br/>wa <span class='ja'>　　</span> <span class='ja'>　　</span>wo<br/>-n</div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Speaking in terms of English pronunciation, the overall Japanese language is based on 5 vowel sounds with a combination of the above consonants. The vowel sounds do not change when paired with other characters.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that ji, from my name <span class='ja'>じむ</span>, is not listed in the alphabet. There are certain characters that can take a <i>ten-ten</i> mark or a <i>maru</i> mark to slightly expand the alphabet. <span class='ja'>し</span>(shi) becomes <span class='ja'>じ</span>(ji).</p><div class='title'><b>Kanji and Readability</b></div><p>Note: Often students wonder, if you can write a sentence using only hiragana, a much less complex writing system, why ever use the other two? Why not write everything in hiragana.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span> vs.<span class='ja'>　じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span></p></p><p>Coming from English, it makes sense to write everything using a limited number of characters, but the overall readability of the kanji sentence is far higher than the second. In fact, I added spaces in the hiragana sentence to improve its readability, but you still have to read each character to understand the words. The kanji sentence doesn't even need it.</p><p>While we don't use Kanji in English, the idea of using symbols to form a familiar shape representing a word is not so foreign. We've been reading and writing English since we were children, and one of the natural passive techniques we've developed is recognizing a word purely based on its shape. As long as the shape of the word fits the pattern we're used to, we can read and understand the word immediately without looking at each of the letters.</p><p>Kanji works the same way. Once you know the meaning of the kanji, you don't even have to read the whole sentence. Because there are so many kanji, much of a sentence's ambiguity is also removed. When I say, "light" without any context, do I mean something that shines on to a surface or something that's not heavy? Much like English, Japan has words written in Hiragana the same way with different meanings. But when using Kanji, the meaning is clear.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Again, learning Japanese is not a simple process. Just takes things step-by-step. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. And, always try.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Culture Shock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/culture-shock">Culture Shock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Almost everyone has some form of culture shock, but it is different for each person and each person deals with it in different ways.</p><p>It can sometimes happen abruptly from a situation or incident, or slowly build from small problems over time. Sometimes, incidents of culture shock can happen immediately upon arrival. Other times, it might be months until feeling some kind of culture shock. For me, there have been two periods where I've lived in Japan, now and study abroad in college. Both circumstances for living in Japan were entirely different, so the conditions of experiencing culture shock were entirely different, too.</p><p>Either way, when living in a foreign country, culture shock follows 4 (or 5) overall stages and the overall graph of your steady mood usually looks like this.</p><p><canvas id="fullChart" /></p><p>Going up, then down, back up and eventually returning to equilibrium. The four main stages are <span class="rainbow_mag"><b>The Honeymoon Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_voi"><b>The Frustration Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_blu"><b>The Adjustment Phase</b></span>, and <span class="rainbow_gre"><b>The Adaption Phase</b></span>. The fifth extra phase is <b>The Reintegration Phase</b>, when returning to your own country.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Honeymoon Phase -</b></div><p>When people think of culture shock, they often think of it as something negative. But, the overall feeling of experiencing life in a new country is often met with excitement. There are so many new things to experience differently from your own country. New food, new buildings, new money, new people, new stores. If you're a fan of your new country, touching things that you've dreamed of for the first time is an amazing experience you'll probably never forget.</p><p>All of these new experiences raise your overall mood level, and we move up the curve.</p><p>If you're only in a foreign country for a short amount of time, especially on vacation or a very short study abroad, this is probably the only part of the curve that you'll experience. This was the case when I studied abroad. Every day felt like a vacation. Exploring Nagasaki and writing blog posts about it was an amazing adventure that had something new and interesting each day. I never experienced any cultural problems large enough to pull me down.</p><p>So, in short, the honeymoon phase is meeting differences in culture with joy and excitement.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Frustration Phase -</b></div><p>The shock phase is the opposite. This is what happens when meeting differences between your countries and cultures has problems. This is also what people think of when they hear, Culture Shock.</p><p>Again, this can happen gradually over the course of several incidents or perhaps even one big incident. Problems are caused by not really understanding what people are saying. Or by people not really understanding you. Problems are caused by something someone said or did that was different than what you expected. Problems are caused by someone putting you into a situation where you felt uncomfortable and you felt trapped. And problems are also caused by small differences in culture that annoy and bother you that built over time.</p><p>It's easy to feel alone when you're in a foreign country. People often describe this feeling as being put into a box. In a foreign country, you don't have the same comforts as your normal routine. If you have a problem, you may not have a way to comfort yourself. And often when seeking those comforts, you can't find an equivalent and often don't know how to ask for it. So, for any problems, you hide in your box and you wait for this feeling to pass. Or, you wait until you're back home.</p><p>Often as you recluse, anything foreign or anything outside of your normal will reinforce these feelings and put you further into a spiral you cannot break from.</p><div class='title'><b>Experience</b></div><p>Often when you're in a foreign country for a short amount of time, you probably won't have enough time for these problems to really build and hit you. And if you do have problems, you only have to wait until the end of trip. There's a fast-approaching light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>That doesn't mean it won't happen for short trips, but be prepared that it might. It really comes down to expectations. Making too many assumptions without verification often leads to problems.</p><p>Frustration and Shock is much more common to occur after several months of living in the country. After meeting with people and working with people, making friends, and hanging out, you begin to feel like you're accepted, and like you've become part of the society.</p><p>But, you are pushed away. Your friends or co-workers do something that clearly shows they do not truly accept you as part of their society. You're just the foreigner, and you'll always be the foreigner. Once again, you made an assumption that you thought was fact.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adjustment Phase -</b></div><p>The overall strategy of Culture Shock is not to avoid it, but learning how to deal with it. This is the adjustment phase. Much like frustration, the ways that people naturally adjust are different for each person, but there's always room to learn and try new ways of returning back to natural mood level.</p><p>Skipping to the punchline, the overall best way of adjusting and understanding the situation better is to talk about it. Talk with your co-workers and friends about why you felt uncomfortable. Talk to other foreigners about similar situations, how they felt and how they overcame it. By talking about it, I mean opening a dialogue and expressing ideas. By talking about it, I <b>do not</b> mean to confront them about what they said and try to teach them why it's bad. </p><p>On one hand, they could absolutely be out of line and did something worthy of being called on. But, on the other hand, within their culture, it could be a socially-accepted action. If you call them on it, you're only reinforcing your foreign divide between them, and possibly reinforcing their behavior. Often in these scenarios, it's up to you to change. It's up to you to ask others and inform yourself about why any misunderstandings may have happened.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Tricks</b></div><p>Above is the overall best way to adjust, but there are several tricks to help elevate your mood.</p><p>If you're being overwhelmed by too many things outside of your comfort zone, try to reconnect with things from your home country. It's a good way to feel like you're normal. Buy some foreign food from your country. Or watch a movie. Or visit somewhere that reminds you of home. Call your parents or call your friends back home. If you feel like an outsider, take a vacation and be an outsider, if only for a few hours or a day.</p><p>It's also pretty simple, but exercise. Exercise is a great way to mentally relax. Often as you blow off all of your physical strength through exercise, your mental strength will get exhausted, too. Then, you're able to move through your emotions and process them. Maybe meditation is your thing instead of exercise? Singing is fun, too.</p><p>Whether its food or exercise or singing, finding some way of centering yourself can slow or stop your downward fall, so you can begin the climb back up.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adaption Phase -</b></div><p>The Adjustment Phase course corrects your mood and brings your back up to normal, through the Adaptation phase.</p><p>The more you understand about your foreign country, the more you can understand about how you fit into it. When you can successfully apply that knowledge to your life, you feel like you've had a win. You feel like you've overcome a barrier and become closer to your new home. <b>This is your overall goal</b>. Overall understanding and adaptation isn't something that happens over night. It takes time, patience, and communication. And often new problems occur. </p><div class='title'><b>Reoccurrence</b></div><p>Culture Shock and frustration isn't a single event. It's often multiple events throughout your life in a foreign country that make you feel like a foreigner and not accepted. Once you feel you've adapted, it's not uncommon for something new and unknown to happen and bring you back down.</p><p>Also, it's not uncommon for people to cling to quick fixes or escape rather than truly reach out, communicate and understand the problem. If you hold on to grudges and problems, you will never fit in and you'll always be an outsider. </p><p>Ultimately, your goal is to fit in society as best as you can. You must adapt in some ways in order to do this. This doesn't mean losing part of yourself. It means gaining a new part of yourself. Gaining the ability to fit into both societies.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Reintegration Phase -</b></div><p>If you're in a foreign country to live forever, then adaptation is the goal. But most foreigners will eventually go back to their country, either for a trip or for good. Then, the whole cycle begins again, but often it can be more severe. This is The Reintegration Phase, also sometimes known as Reverse Culture Shock.</p><p>If you've adapted and integrated in your foreign country, now YOU are the foreigner when you return home. You are expected to pick up life exactly as you left it, but you are different. You've changed. You do things differently than before. You talk different than before. Your personality may have changed, too. Depending on the length of time you've been away, your country has changed, too.</p><p>If you've been integrated in your foreign country for a while, you can often forget what it's like to no longer have a foreign bubble around you. You suddenly instantly passively understand everyone and everything around you, whereas in your new country, you become comfortable in certain levels of understanding. </p><p>People make a lot of assumptions about you, too, because they don't see you as anything different than themselves. Adjusting is often a harsh reality of what you've left behind.</p><p>This is normal. But, you've been here before. Honeymoon phase, Frustration phase, Adjustment phase, and Adaptation phase. Do your best, and don't give up. Communicate, Exercise, and Adapt.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Virtual Tokyo Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/virtual-tokyo-marathon">Virtual Tokyo Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 18, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As the pandemic began, live events around the world were canceled and marathons were no exception. Luckily for them, the virus landed under their “acts of god” clause in their contracts, so they didn’t need to issue any refunds. But they had to adapt to the situation, just like everyone else and all other companies in order to stay in business.</p><p>In lieu of being able to do physical marathons, many organizations began to host Virtual marathons, and many of these virtual marathons were free or significantly cheaper than doing them in person. To run them, you needed to download a GPS tracking running app, like Strava, and record a run with the same length as the race within the correct time period.</p><p>These virtual marathons became so frequent and so cheap that throughout 2021 I was running one nearly every weekend. In 2018, I set a new personal record in distance having run a total of 367km in official races over the entire year. I spent nearly $1000 doing this, too. In 2021, I ran 365.6km in all of my races combined, only spending $200. This was an absolute godsend, even though my race times weren’t nearly as good.</p><p>The Tokyo Marathon was a race that had been on my bucket list ever since I started running in Japan. Every year I applied, but every year, I was unable to win the entry lottery for general entry. Much like all other marathons, it had been canceled in 2020 and pushed to 2021. Then canceled again and pushed to 2022. </p><p>Finally, this year, the Tokyo Marathon was finally held again, but only for the elite and career marathon runners. There was no general entry. To make up for this, they added an online component. Anyone who had general entry in the race could participate online for free. Additionally, the general entry became open to everyone for 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. This was finally my chance! Not only that, I only had to run a half marathon rather than a full.</p><p>On March 5th, in the yet still snowy country-side, I ran my half marathon and completed the race. The app was very cumbersome, and I wasn’t really sure if my time actually registered. But today! I got my medal in the mail.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Perhaps it is not a legitimate Tokyo Marathon medal, but it is good enough for me!

| April 2, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the main goals of Pokemon is to catch every species of Pokemon available. I've talked about this before in my post about the <a href="/old/v7/completing-the-national-pokedex" title="/completing-the-national-pokedex">National Pokedex</a>. But, it's possible to take this a step further. These days, for every Pokemon, there is a 1 in 4096 chance that it will be <b>Shiny</b>. A Shiny pokemon is a rare variant that appears in a different color. </p><p>Recent Pokemon Games have had methods of increasing the odds of getting a Shiny Pokemon. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've been streaming video games on Twitch. And, in particular, I've been streaming hunts of Shiny Pokemon through these methods. When streaming on Twitch, I have HTML overlays in OBS that shows my progress of catching all Shiny Pokemon in the game, so I can keep track of what I have left to catch.</p><p>I've been streaming Shiny Hunts in <b>Let's Go Eevee</b>, and recently with the release of the excellent <b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b>. Additionally, <b>Pokemon Go</b> makes it VERY easy to catch Shiny Pokemon. Not only is there is an increased base Shiny catch rate of 1 in 512, but often there are events that increase the odds as much as 1 in 20. So, I made a similar list to track my Shiny progress there, too.</p><p>You can view copies of these lists from the following links:</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><b>Pokemon Let's Go Eevee</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo">Shiny Completion List</a></div><div class="column"><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/dex" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/dex">Shiny Completion List</a><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/order" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/order">Shiny Catches</a><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/missing" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/missing">Remaining Shiny Pokemon</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><b>Pokemon Go</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/go" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/go">Shiny Completion List</a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>With all these lists keeping track of Shiny Pokemon, I was curious about my Shiny Progress across all Pokemon games. I have caught a few Shiny Pokemon in the main games, too, through events and randomly (though, rarely) in the wild. Combining all the counts from the above lists and the main games, I made an overall Shiny list.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><b>All Games Combined</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex">Overall Shiny Completion List</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast">&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These lists are mostly up to date, but because I am manually entering data, it's really easy for them to get out of date.

While watching various YouTube videos during the pandemic, one video showed that you could find a Shiny in about 20 minutes by catching the same Pokemon over and over again. I tried it out, and it worked! I caught my first Shiny Magikarp.</p><p>In Let's Go, you can increase your chances of getting a Shiny by doing three things. One, when you complete the Pokedex, you'll get a Shiny Charm. This will give you 2 extra chances for a Shiny. Two, when you use a Lure in the game, it'll give you 1 extra chance. And Three, the biggest one, when you catch the same Pokemon, you build a Catch Combo. When that combo reaches 31 and above, you'll get 11 extra chances for a Shiny. With all three combined, this gives 15 chances out of 4096, the equivalent to 1 in about 274.</p><p>It was incredibly satisfying to start up a stream, and usually have a shiny appear once every hour. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>While streaming, I would record my shiny catches using <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">schlock-bot</a>, and use that <a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo">above overlay</a> to display my progress.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b></div><p>I am in absolute love with Pokemon Legends Arceus.

One, the Shiny Charm will give 3 extra chances this time. Two, the overall goal of the game is to complete the Pokedex. You do this by more than just catching Pokemon, though. If you complete an entry, you'll get 1 extra roll. But, if you perfect the entry, you'll get another 2 extra rolls. With all of these combined, you'll 7 chances out of 4096, the equivalent of 1 in about 586.  Just in the wild!</p><p>Additionally, there are Mass Outbreaks and Massive Mass Outbreaks of Pokemon. Including all of the above, Pokemon in mass outbreaks have a Shiny chance of 1 in about 128! In Massive Mass Outbreaks, chances are 1 in about 216. These chances are even better than Let's Go!</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Pokemon Legends is my favorite Pokemon game of all time, it is incredibly satisfying to fly around and collect Shiny Pokemon. Much like Let's Go, I recorded my shiny catches using <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">schlock-bot</a>, which updated the above display lists.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Go and Others</b></div><p>People have been Shiny Hunting on Twitch and YouTube forever, but I don't think it became mainstream and accessible until Pokemon Go. As mentioned above, the overall base Shiny rate is increased to 1 in 512. I think this was their incentive to keep people playing because if you play for 3-4 hours straight in a day, you have a pretty high chance of finding a Shiny pokemon. </p><p>Furthermore, Pokemon Go often has events that make Shiny hunting easier. One way is increasing the spawns of particular rare Pokemon, which gives you more to catch and more chance for a Shiny to appear. Another way is increasing the base odds of a Shiny appearing. The most common of these events is the Community Day, which boosts the odds up to 1 in 20! You are virtually guaranteed to catch several during the event!</p><p>Because of Pokemon Go, I think Game Freak has made Shiny hunting more accessible in the main games, too. Also with Pokemon spawning in the overworld (instead of random battles), you can easily see whether a Pokemon is Shiny. You can check WAY MORE pokemon these days than you could before.</p><p>In my free time, I still stream on Twitch, and usually I'm playing Pokemon. So, feel free to stop by and say hi!<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
