| July 12, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Saturday was pretty fun, I was really looking forward to today, Sunday.  Today we have Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, Eric Prydz, and Sasha.  Guy Gerber has been solidifying his name among the best in the business over the last couple of years.  Eric Prydz has been HUGE in all the circles of electronic music.  And Sasha is a living legend.  Sasha's involvement guaranteed my sale from the first day tickets went on sale.</p><p>Five and I woke up from our long day of music, and finally left the house around Noon Thirty, I think.  The skies were pretty clear, but there were some bizarre storm warnings that came across the morning news and the weather reports.  One report announced a Severe Thunderstorm warning from 12:45 to 1:30, which we thought was odd.  The radar had absolutely no storm activity in the Chicago area.</p><p>We were directly West of downtown a couple of miles, so our plan was to drive down Lake St., then north up Michigan Ave, to Lake Shore Dr., and then get to the beach.  During the 20 minutes it took us to drive 4 miles to Michigan Ave, the sky turned completely dark.  Huge black clouds surrounding down Chicago.  And winds blew around all kinds of trash and debris.  People walking around on the streets quickly went inside of building to shield themselves for the horror that was about to dump in the downtown area.</p><p>Five and I turned onto Michigan Ave, and got onto Lake Shore Dr. pretty quickly.  Over Lake Michigan there were clear blue skies, but looking West was the direct opposite.  Five continued to drive north, and the clouds emptied on to the city.  We seemed to escape it, though, as only a couple of drops hit our car.  We passed a couple of downed trees by the beach, where everyone was evacuating.</p><p>We reached Montrose beach, which is about 6 miles north of downtown.  All of the storm clouds really stayed directly over Chicago.  There were gray clouds above where we were, but the really dark horrific ones were south.  It was very bizarre.</p><p>Rather than head out to the beach in the middle of a storm, Five and I walked to a nearby restaurant to meet up with our pal, Brian, to wait out the storm.  40 minutes later, we exited the restaurant.  The skies were a little gray, but the storm definitely passed.  By the time, we actually got to the opening gate for Wavefront, you couldn't even tell that a storm was there.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp"  /></p><p>Well, except for the line of people waiting to get in.  Wavefront shut down, and evacuated everyone for 2 hours for fear of storm damage.  A fire department helicopter was circling the beach, and accessing the current weather before Wavefront could proceed with its event.  We were in line only a little while before the Fire department gave the go ahead, and people were admitted entrance.</p><p>Five, Brian, and I made it in around the same time we got in on Saturday, about 3pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp"  /></p><p>I went straight over to the North Stage to see who was on deck.  <b>Danny Daze</b> was spinning a fantastic groovy House set to welcome the crowd back into the festival.</p><p>By the way, along the sides of each stage were a bunch of VIP cabanas.  The North Stage had 3 big ones, and 4 smaller ones.  Each of those Large cabanas cost $10000 to rent for the weekend.  They included plenty of accommodations on top of the prime real estate, but yikes...  I think I'd rather buy a car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>We wandered around a little bit though, and found ourselves over at the South Stage, where <b>Betatraxx</b> was spinning a rather hilarious set.</p><p>The tracks he played was a perfect example of why a lot of people don't take dubstep seriously.  He played a dubstep remix of the <b>Requiem for a Dream</b> epic ending song.  He followed it up with a dubstep remix of the <b>Epic Fight Music</b>.  And then went into a dubstep remix of <b>NES Punch Out</b>.  After which he threw in some classical music, and other dubstep remixes of random well known songs.  It's a prime example of pandering to the crowd for cheap cheers rather than actually building an incredible vibe that stands on its own.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp"  /></p><p>We were really just waiting around for <b>Nadia Ali</b> and <b>Chris Lake</b> to show up.  Nadia was supposed to start at 4pm, but the time came and went without her on stage.  Then 4:30pm rolled around, and Chris Lake didn't show up either.  I guess they were delayed because of the freak weather earlier.</p><p>A local DJ took the stage not too long after 4:30.  He was only up there for 20 minutes or so before Chris Lake arrived and took over the controls.</p><p>The crowd was certainly into it, but my attention headed back to the North Stage.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp"  /></p><p>At 5pm, <b>Benoit &amp; Sergio</b> started to perform their set on the North Stage, and that's basically where I stayed for the rest of the day.  They played a fantastic set that was both mellow and energetic and played perfectly off the crowd.  Their set rolled perfectly into <b>Guy Gerber</b> who continued with the beautiful vibe.  He didn't tear down the vibe, or try to change it.  He built on the sound Benoit &amp; Sergio started and subtly crept in his own sound.  Seamless.</p><p>And what Guy Gerber started, <b>Steve Lawler</b> built upon.  He absolutely set me on fire.  I don't know why I had a negative opinion of him before, but his set was the perfect build up.  Everything started with Benoit &amp; Sergio into Guy Gerber into Steve Lawler, and just kept building and building, hour after hour.  I was so lost in the atmosphere that I could not care one bit that <b>Eric Prydz</b> was on the South Stage.  I could not pull myself away from Steve Lawler.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp"  /></p><p>And as the clock hit 8:30pm, the stage rotated around for <b>Sasha</b>, and much like the DJs before him, he continued to build.  He piled on that raw classic sound with the fresh chill sounds of summer.</p><p>I think trying to describe the sound of his set is a bit futile.  I mentioned in a <a href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago" title="/sasha-spybar-chicago">previous post</a> that aside from his darker raw progressive house sound, he has a more Tech House / Indie House kind of sound that he's been spinning at his 'Never say Never' events at Ushuaia Beach Resort in Ibiza.  But at this point his Tech House / Indie House vibe has completely taken over, but with his signature style underneath.</p><p>Over the last year, he's been in the studio producing some of his own music.  He's released a few tracks on his Last Night of Earth record label, as well as working on the third installment of his Involver CD series, which he's been somewhat secretive about.</p><p>He started 'Never say Never' because he felt he wasn't playing tracks from all the artists he loved, and, now, 3 years later, he's made that sound his own.  He's separated himself from the other Progressive House kings, and puts himself alongside Guy Gerber, Benoit &amp; Sergio, and all the other DJs that spin a more Tech House vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp"  /></p><p>His set from Wavefront was the perfect soundtrack to a warm summer day.

After going to North Coast and Spring Awakening, it was amazing going to a festival where I was completely in tune with the music.

Both festivals are geared towards the new generation of electronica fans, and the music I care about gets shoved in whatever time slots remain.</p><p>I really hope SpyBar achieved the success they hoped for with Wavefront, and I hope they make this a yearly event.

| July 4, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The summer of music festivals continued this last weekend with the Wavefront Music Festival.  Wavefront was hosted by Spy Bar on Chicago's Montrose Beach, slightly north of the downtown area.  The purpose of Wavefront was to bring together the old crowd of electronic music lovers, with the new crowd.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp"  /></p><p>For the past couple of years, React has grown and grown and become the leader in electronic entertainment in Chicago, and the type of talent they've brought to Chicago has been mostly mainstream.</p><p>I complained about this a little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">Spring Awakening</a> post, but as dubstep, electro house, and other certain genres have become quite mainstream, the other genres are starting to become second class citizens.  At first, there was room for everyone, and all of electronic dance music seemed to flourish, but these days it seems like those genres are getting choked out by the popular crap.</p><p>I think the fans of true dance music are starting to notice, and fight back a little bit.  There was an article a couple weeks ago, railing on the popular DJs today, enforcing that they don't even play DJ sets.  They basically just play rock concerts.  They play the same set from front to back without little variation at all.  They don't play to the crowd.</p><p>And that's exactly what the kids these days want.  They go to these major events to hear their favorite tunes, rather than hear something new or reactive to the vibe.  That's why so many of these DJs are playing the same songs from the last 3 or 4 years, and why they play so many pandering dubstep remixes.  The crowds at these concerts <b>only seem to care about the content of the song</b>, rather than the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Wavefront had two stages, the North stage and the South stage.  The South stage had plenty of electro house, dubstep, and other popular crap.  They had such acts as Bad Boy Bill, MSTRKRFT, Erick Morillo, Chris Lake, John Dahlback, Eric Prydz, and Duck Sauce.</p><p>The North Stage had me sold on Day 1, though.  They had Visionquest, Art Department, Matthew Dear, Benoit &amp; Sergio, Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, and <b>Sasha</b>.  All groovy mellow house, whether it be Progressive House, Deep House, or Tech House.</p><div class='title'><b>Day 1 - Saturday</b></div><p>Five and I both purchased weekend passes for this event, and went down to Chicago on Saturday afternoon.  We got to the beach around 3 o'clock, right in the middle of <b>Visionquest's</b> set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp"  /></p><p>Visionquest played a very nice mellow opener set for the day.  It wasn't outrageous or over top.  It was the perfect start for the day.  And the perfect set up for <b>Art Department</b>.</p><p>Art Department played an amazing bass heavy deep house set.  I recognized a couple of tunes from some of their previous sets, and ones from Sasha, too.  This was how I knew I was home at this festival.  The crowd responded and grooved along with the set, and Art Department kept pumping in the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The sound from the North Stage was incredible.  In that above photo, you can see piles of subwoofers in front of the stage.  You could move almost anywhere on the beach, and still hear the music with perfect clarity.</p><p>And most of the crowd was pretty well spread out too, so you could move around without bumping into people.  There were people in the back, laying on their towels, catching some sun.  Other people sitting in some plastic chairs, relaxing to the wonderful music.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>As Art Department finished up their kickin' groovy set, <b>Matthew Dear</b> hopped up on the stage and starting setting up for his act.

He brought the vibe down a little bit from the heights Art Department brought it to, but Matthew kept it going.</p><p>Five and I started wandering around a little bit to see what else was going on.  We walked over to the local stage and listened to <b>Gene Farris</b> for a little while.  And he was playing a pretty energetic Housey set.

It seems like whatever substance he may have had back in the day is long gone now.</p><p>Five and I continued to walk around the festival grounds.

These guys are one of the few electro groups that I haven't written off yet.  Underneath their occasional obnoxious sounds, they still carry a beat.  It's still Dance music.  Most popular tracks these days, and Dubstep especially really isn't dance music as much as it is "rock-out" music.  You can't dance to it.  You throw your fists and arms in the air, and rock out, or rage out to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, MSTRKRFT's set didn't really evolve over time.  When they transitioned from track to track, it felt more like they were simply changing it up, rather than building on whatever vibe they had set.  So, after awhile, it really didn't carry as much weight.  It went back to the mentality of having a set list, rather than a vibe.

So, Five and I took off for the day.  We drove north a little bit and went to a small pizza place with a whole lot of comfortable seating.  It was a pretty fine day, and we still had the rest of the night to look forward to.</p><p>Wavefront had plenty of after parties to choose from, but the one I was most interested in was the one at Smart Bar.</p><div class='title'><b>Visionquest + Art Department @ Smart Bar</b></div><p>Art Department blew me away earlier in the day, and I definitely wanted to hear more of them.

It was a mix of Deep House, and regular 'ol House.  And much like their set during the Wavefront Festival, they kept a lid on the vibe.  They never went over the top, or blew me away, but kept that perfect tempo that continued to tease me.  It really felt like they were holding back, but that was par for the course as they were opening up the night for Art Department later on.</p><p>Visionquest is a 4 man group, and it seemed like each member was given an hour (or so) to spin the set they wanted.  When we arrived <b>Ryan Crosson</b> was on the decks.  Around 12:30 or 1 o'clock, <b>Lee Curtiss</b> took over the controls for the better part of the evening.  Lee played a fantastic set, but again, it still felt like an opening set.</p><p>As 2am rolled around, I was starting to feel the wear of the night.

| July 2, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About a week ago, I was at a JET related event, and one of the other attendees made mention of the following books: Tonoharu.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp"  /></p><p>Tonoharu is a graphic novel series written by a former JET, and is loosely based on his own experiences while teaching abroad for 3 years.  The author, Lars Martinson, taught from 2003 to 2006 in Fukuoka, Japan.  I assume he means Fukuoka prefecture, and not Fukuoka city.  The story is set in the small fictional town of Tonoharu, and mentions its about an hour away from any major city.</p><div class='title'><b>Prologue</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp"  /></p><p>Before we get into the actual story of Tonoharu, Lars starts everything off in the prologue.  These several pages focus on Lars himself as he nears the end of his first year contract.  He reflects on the past 8 months of his stay in Japan, and wonders whether or not to renew.  The life hasn't been what he expected, and he's had several challenges to face he wasn't prepared for.</p><p>I think this section is rather brilliant, because through explaining his own situation, we're also introduced to the actual characters in the book.  He also foreshadowing all the events to happen over the course of the 3 book series as well.  All things I didn't pay attention to at all until I read it a second time.</p><div class='title'><b>Part One</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp"  /></p><p>The main character in Tonoharu is <b>Dan Welles</b>, and he is Lars' predecessor.  The story focuses on Dan's experience teaching abroad.  It begins with Dan meeting his own predecessor, and attending his welcoming party.  It continues with Dan's first classes at his school, and giving his self-introduction class lesson.  And it expands on Dan's character, and introduces several other characters too.</p><p>The story throughout Part One seems like a pretty good introduction to the type of situations one would have when teaching English in Japan's grade school system.  I guess it's implied that Dan is in the JET Programme, but it's never directly referenced.  Also, given that Lars' started JET in 2003, I'm assuming that this is supposed to take place in 2002.  I'm not sure why Dan doesn't have a cellphone, or why he never researches anything on a computer.  This ain't the 90s.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp"  /></p><p>Dan is a completely fictional character.  Well... at least, I really hope he's completely fictional.  Dan is an unconfident unprepared unmotivated person.  He doesn't seem to have any hobbies, or desires, or any real personality.  He kind of acts like some people I used to know...</p><p>At first, I figured the guy was just shy.  I consider myself a little bit shy, so I can relate, and being thrown into certain situations can make me very nervous, and seemingly uninteresting, or boring, or whatever.  So, at the beginning, I figured Dan was just adjusting to the new culture and taking things slow.</p><p>But he never pulls himself out of this rut.  I don't think he's too afraid to branch out, he just doesn't know how to.  I guess he does try asking people about what things to do, and he tries to make friends with people...  and they all blow him off.  But he just stops at that point.  He feels like all of his avenues are cut off, so he doesn't know how to take care of himself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp"  /></p><p>...and as such, he gets even more depressed.</p><p>This guy is basically the Charlie Brown of the JET Programme.  Nothing seems to go his way, and he keeps taking all the shit that life gives him.</p><div class='title'><b>Part Two</b></div><p>Part Two represents a bit of a change for the series.  It still focuses on Dan, and his incredible unmotivated depression, but expands on all the characters introduced in Part One.  In fact, I think Lars spends way too much time on the character interactions that the uniqueness of this taking place in Japan seems to fade away.  I guess that could represent that over time all the things that seem unique and interesting become normal and mundane because you're used to them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp"  /></p><p>But he's really building a story.  I think the down to earth nature of the comic is absolutely it's strong point, he really needs a story, and I think that's when the fictiveness of the entire series starts breaking the reality a bit.  Now we have the kooky rich europeans that the whole town hates.  And the stereotypical "playboy" who sleeps with all kinds of women.  And a love interest too! though that trope felt very natural in its execution.</p><p>Overall, I think it's still very good.  And the art is really unique too.  It's very simple and straightforward like a typical newspaper comic, but has an incredible amount of detail and complexity when it needs it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Part Three</b></div><p>This is a 3 part graphic novel series, and, at the moment, only two volumes have been finished.  He's definitely working on the final book of the series.  In a semi-recent <a href="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/" title="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/">blog post</a> he mentions that he's a third of the way complete!</p><p>Also, reading through Lars' blog, it seems that he's back in Japan again, and he's been writing a web comic series about his current misadventures entitled the <b>Kameoka Dairies</b>.  This series is much more direct about specific subjects he's come across from daily life in Japan, rather than building an all encompassing story.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>This series does feel a bit negative about the experiences one might have when teaching English in Japan, but after taking a hard look at the main character, it feels like he's done this to himself.  If you're active, know how to ask questions, and have motivation to get the most out of life, I don't think you'd have as rough a time as our pal Dan did.</p><p>I think if you've ever been in JET, or are interested in joining JET, this book series is a must read.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
