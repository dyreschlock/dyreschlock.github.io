| April 7, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in February, people began circulating a video about a mod for the GameBoy Camera. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSb0cRK9xI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSb0cRK9xI">Macho Nacho made a video</a> about how you could take apart your GameBoy camera, and put it into a new shell created by 2BitToy. This shell used a CS mount ring, which would allow you to attach any CS mount camera lens to the GameBoy camera. People have made GameBoy Camera mods before. But, this was the first non-destructive, compact, and stable modification made easily available.</p><p>Here's the website detailing the mod: <a href="https://2bittoy.carrd.co/" title="https://2bittoy.carrd.co/">https://2bittoy.carrd.co/</a></p><p>It looked really simple and it wasn't too expensive. The Analogue Pocket has recently revived my interest in retro handheld accessories, so I ordered all of the parts and let things slowly arrive over time. Now that it's Spring Break, it's time to put everything together!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised how fast and easy it came together. You can look through the pictures below to see how I assembled everything together. Macho Nacho's video also shows the step-by-step process of putting together the camera.</p><p><b>One thing to note!</b> In Macho Nacho's video, he doesn't recommend using this mod with the Analogue Pocket. However, he's using Version 1 of the 3D printed shell. When I purchased the parts, Shapeways had Version 2. Version 2 is a little fatter than the original.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the whole thing assembled, it is really tight when fitting it into the cartridge slot of the Analogue Pocket. This may or may not be a problem in itself, BUT there is no movement of the cartridge after it's inserted. It is very solid. That said, when actually taking pictures, I'm not going to hold it like a GameBoy. I plan on holding it in the middle to balance all of the weight.</p><div class='title'><b>Assembly</b></div><p>There are 3 overall steps required to make this once you've gathered all of the parts: (1) taking apart a GameBoy Camera, (2) glueing the CS mount ring and IR filter, and (3) putting everything together. I let the Epoxy sit overnight to harden, but otherwise, it took me no longer than an hour to do everything. It was really fast.</p><p>I would recommend glueing the CS mount ring and IR filter first. Then, the disassembly and assembly can be done together very quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>Required Parts and Tools for Building</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Macho Nacho's video details all of the parts and tools you'll need, but I'll reiterate them here for comparison.</p><p>There are 5 main set of parts you'll need to create the Camera Plus.</p><p>1. You'll need an original <b>GameBoy Camera</b>. You'll take this apart and use the insides. If you don't already have one, you'll have to search on eBay for one. I got one from Yahoo Auctions for 2930<span class='ja'>円</span> with shipping.</p><p>2. You'll need a set of <b>3D printed plastic components</b> to create the new shell for the Camera. You can print them yourself using the files from 2BitToy's website. Or, you can buy printed ones from ShapeWays. There are 4 total: The front and back shell, the sensor mount, and the IR filter mount. With shipping to Japan, this was $92.83<br/><a href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy" title="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy">https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy</a></p><p>3. This is optional, but it's probably worth it. You'll need a <b>10mm x 1.0mm IR Filter</b>. Linked below is the one that I purchased. It was 1200<span class='ja'>円</span>.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V</a></p><p>4. You'll need a <b>5mm CS Mount Lens ring</b>. This will be glued to the back shell and used to screw in the lens. It was 816<span class='ja'>円</span><br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A</a></p><p>5. Lastly, you'll need a <b>CS Mount Zoom Lens</b>. This is the one I purchased. Only 2660<span class='ja'>円</span>!<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9</a></p><p>Altogether, the materials cost 7606<span class='ja'>円</span> and $92.83, a total of about $150. Actually, I suppose this isn't so cheap after all. Although, your mileage may vary depending on how cheap you can get a GameBoy Camera and Lens.</p><div class='title'><b>Required Tools</b></div><p>You'll also need a few totals to disassemble the GameBoy Camera and glue some parts together. This adds a little bit more to the grand total.</p><p>1. You probably already have a <b>Phillips screwdriver</b>, but you need to have one fine enough to remove small screws. </p><p>2. You'll also need <b>Epoxy</b> to glue the Lens ring to the back shell and the IR filter to its mount. You may already have this, but it's easy to buy at your local hardware store. You can see the brand I purchased from my photos.</p><p>3. Something you probably don't have is a <b>Tri-point screwdriver</b>. Old Nintendo products used screws with three divots in them, rather than a flat-head or a Phillips. I did not already have this. They are readily available on Amazon, though. I bought the following one.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS</a></p><div class='title'><b>Photo Results</b></div><p>It is uncanny how much definition and versatility this modification adds to the GameBoy. You can take a picture from across the room by zooming in and focusing using the dials on the lens.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I can't wait to take this thing out in the field and take some photos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon x Kogei ポケモンx工芸" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-kogei">Pokemon x Kogei ポケモンx工芸</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 4, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From March 21st through June 11th, the National Craft Museum in Kanazawa, Ishikawa is hosting an exhibit entitled, Pokemon x Kouge. Kouge <span class='ja'>工芸</span> is Japanese for crafts, such as pottery, woodworking, and any other profession that designs and creates materials and works. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" /></a></p><p>20 Japanese artisans and craftsmen, from young to old, were challenged with how they could incorporate Pokemon into their works. How could they make something that could display the essence of a Pokemon, whether it be through their appearance, gestures, or traces of gameplay through trading, evolving, or battling? How would a particular Pokemon's personality or history clash or match with traditional crafts? With these questions and ideas, they have created over 70 original works displayed in this exhibit.</p><p>Here's the website: <a href="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/" title="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/">https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/</a></p><p>Also, here's the exhibit brochure:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing"> https://drive.google.com/.../15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK</a></p><p>A friend sent me a link to this exhibit. I had seen a link about it before, but I didn't realize it was in Kanazawa. So close! I thought it was in Tokyo, or Osaka, or something. So, I went there on Thursday March 30th and arrived around 11:30am. There was a line to enter, but I only had to wait 20 minutes. Not too bad for a Thursday. They had reservation tickets available, which would probably be necessary on weekends. Individual tickets were 900<span class='ja'>円</span>. You can buy tickets online, too.</p><p>The exhibit was divided into three sections: Appearance, Stories, and Life. All of my photos are included at the bottom.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>すがたーせまる</span>！ Appearance - Approach!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first room were works inspired by the appearance of the Pokemon. How does a Pokemon's appearance inspire these craftsmen to use their mastery to develop artwork that evokes both the spirit of the Pokemon and a demonstration of the mastery of their craft. This section featured artwork from Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> and Mitsuta Haruo <span class='ja'>満田晴穂</span> (both Metal Works), Fukuda Toru <span class='ja'>福田亭</span> (Wood Works), and Imai Sadamasa <span class='ja'>今井完眞</span> and Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span> (Ceramics).</p><p>My favorite pieces from this section was the Jolteon by Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> (pictured above), and the vase and bowl entitled "Vase with Pokemon of the Universe" <span class='ja'>森羅万像ポケモン壷</span> and "Beautiful Bowl with the Super-Ancient of Pokemon" <span class='ja'>超古代ポケモン玉盌</span>. Both were created by Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span>. (pictured below)</p><p>The Pokemon vase was interesting because you could stare at it for hours searching for various Pokemon and continue to find new ones you hadn't before.

All of the vases were really goofy, and the yukatas were pretty. The Yukatas, created by Shiromi Eiichi, were made using a Bingata pattern-style, traditional to Okinawa. These have repeated patterns of nature using primary colors of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. The Alola starters, Pikachu, Raichu, and Oricorio fit both the pattern of colors, and island theme.</p><p>I think the biggest standouts to me were the transformable Rookidee figures which "evolve" into Corviknight, by Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span>. Obviously the size is off, but the proportions of both Pokemon are perfect, and coming up with a design to allow them to transform into each other is fascinating.

| March 30, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Along the Shou river and within the various Gasshou-style villages in southern Toyama prefecture, there is a restaurant that stands alone on the side of the road with a bear of its sign. Underneath, there's another sign that says <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>, or <I>Kuma-don</I>, or a Bear Bowl, which would be a bowl of rice with bear meat. Nearly 6 years ago, I saw this sign as teachers and I were going exploring on our way to Kanazawa. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is <b>Takachiyo</b>, a restaurant that serves dishes made from the meat of local wildlife.</p><p>While the sign is very noticeable, its location is very out-of-the-way. It's about halfway between Takayama and Toyama along the highway, but it's about 10 minutes away from the highway exit. Most people from Takayama don't take the highway when going to Toyama because Route 41 has no tolls and takes the same amount of time. Route 41 goes a completely different direction through the mountains, so it never connects to the highway.</p><p>Here's the location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9" title="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9">https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9</a></p><p>Today, I went to Kanazawa, so on my return trip, I finally had the opportunity to visit the restaurant again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides bear meat, the hunter that owns the restaurant, also traps deer and boar from the surrounding mountains. All of his dishes are prepared using local ingredients, including mountain vegetables, rice, and noodles. Soba noodles are hand-made from buckwheat grown by local people. </p><p>The menu mentions that killing animals for money is evil. However, we all live by consuming plants and animals. We must give thanks to them before each meal (and live together with them, in nature). This is the basic explanation of "Ittedakimasu," which is the 'grace' we all say before we eat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Five years ago, on my first visit to Takachiyo, I ordered their signature dish, the <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>. The bear meat was alright. It was tough and had a full taste, like beef. But, it also had a stringy-ness to it. Added with onions, eggs, and served on rice, it tasted delicious. </p><p>I went with some friends, and they ordered other dishes. One of my friends got some deer nabe. Nabe is a bit bowl of boiling broth with lots of vegetables and meat. It's similar to stew, but stew's main base is meat. Nabe's main base are the vegetables. Nabe is very weak in comparison. </p><p>The deer meat was alright. Japanese wild animals are much smaller compared with their American counterparts. They don't have gigantic bodies or gigantic muscles. As such, it didn't taste like venison I've had in the past. Again, more stringy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my meal today, I ordered a Boar Bowl and Boar Udon. Boar was the one animal I hadn't tried last time, so I wanted to complete the triangle. The boar meat in both dishes was rough, like a flank steak. The meat itself had a dry texture, even though it was submerged in the Udon broth.</p><p>Overall, I would say that if you planned on going here to try exotic meats, you may leave disappointed. However, you would not be disappointed with the actual meals. While the meats themselves were just okay, the rice bowls and udon tasted excellent. Very good. Just good enough that I would recommend going out of the way to try and visit at least once.</p><p>There are plenty more things available on the menu than what I've ordered so far. He had English menus available to take, so I scanned it. Also, I still had a Japanese menu from the first time I visited.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Last of Us" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

People had survived, but many didn't. In present day, a governmental military organization runs strict quarantine procedures in many urban areas. Though, many had fallen to uprisings or further outbreaks.</p><p>You play as Joel. As the outbreak occurred 20 years ago, he lost his daughter. But he continued to survive, doing anything that was necessary. In present day, he is tasked with bringing a young girl, Ellie, across the country in hopes of finding a cure for the infection. Throughout the journey, they experience loss and they gain trust and companionship with each other. Over time, Joel allows himself to love and be responsible for someone else again. Ellie as well, allow herself to trust someone unequivocally after being abandoned by everyone she's known in her life.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Originally released for the Playstation 3 in the fall of 2013, many people regard it to be one of the best stories of all time portrayed in a video game. After playing it for the first time, I thought it was okay. Zombies have been done to death, and this didn't really seem all that original. ESPECIALLY, when Telltale's Walking Dead game come out a year prior and roughly told the exact same story. I guess people liked Last of Us better because there was actual gameplay behind it, rather than only dialogue.</p><p>This year, 9 years after the release of the first game, HBO and Naughty Dog created The Last of Us TV show. The first season (of 9 episodes) covers the entirety of the first game. It is incredible how well the tension is portrayed in the show. Everything feels like it has weight. Pedro Pascal truly brings out how much Joel does not want to relive his daughter's death through having to take responsibility for Ellie. And Bella Ramsey perfectly portrays Ellie's care-free attitude that hides her true inner feelings. Their slow personality changes over their terrifying and horrific experiences feel authentic and help you identify with both of their situations and choices.</p><p>At the end of the TV show, I felt like I understood the characters better than I had before. Also, it had been long enough since The Walking Dead and the overexposure of Zombie media, that I was more open to paying attention to the finer details of the story, rather than quickly writing it off.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Because of the TV show, I decided to replay The Last of Us again. There are 3 separate versions of The Last of Us, plus a standalone story, plus a sequel. Almost a year after the Playstation 3 release, the game was touched up and remastered for the Playstation 4 in 2014. The standalone story was included in this. With the overwhelming success of the game, The Last of Us Part 2 was released in 2020. And, they've remastered the original game again for the Playstation 5. The Last of Us Part 1 was released in September 2022. I played <b>Last of Us Remastered</b> on Playstation 4 because I already owned it, and the Playstation 5 version was expensive.</p><p>Today, I finished it. It was very interesting comparing it to the TV show. There were plenty of parts that they changed to adapt the video game to television, but I was really surprised how much of it was identical. Same basic overall story beats, but with a bit more context added and a lot of action and fight scenes removed. I'm curious how much things changed in the Playstation 5 remaster.</p><p>Anyway, as I originally played the Playstation 3 version 9 years ago, I was very impressed with the environments. So much vegetation had reclaimed the concrete building over the 20 years since civilization had fallen. The Playstation 3 never had an option for screenshots, so I could never roam around taking photos in the game. Thankfully, screenshots became a standard addition with video games for the Playstation 4.  As I replayed Last of Us Remastered, I was to take all of the screenshots that I couldn't before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think in some areas, the age does show in the game.

| March 17, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Pokemon is filled with some unique evolution methods and forms across several species. Some may say that Vivillion is one of the more annoying Pokemon with its forms. But I think it was pretty interesting. It debuted as part of Pokemon X/Y, the first pokemon game on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. Depending on the region of your game, a single certain form of Vivillion would be available out of a total of 18. There were 2 additionally forms released later as events, for a grand total of 20 forms.</p><p>The impetus was to connect and trade with people all over the world to get all of the forms, if you wanted them. But, because of this obtuse mechanic, they have not been available in any main game since. Two years ago, with the release of Pokemon Home, I decided to try and get all of the forms by doing trades and it didn't take me too long to do so.</p><p>With the release of Pokemon Scarlet/Violet in November, Vivillion had finally returned. However, only the <b>Fancy</b> pattern (which was previously event only) was available in the game. All of the other forms were available in the game's code, but how could we get them? Things started to become slightly clearly when Scatterbug and Vivillion became available in Pokemon Go in December. Oh, we could just transfer them from Pokemon Go once Pokemon Home support came to Scarlet/Violet.</p><p>In order to catch Scatterbug and Vivillion in Pokemon Go, you had to save Postcards received from Presents which you receive from Friends on your Friend's List from all over the world. If you saved 3 Postcards from a region, you'd get an encounter with a Scatterbug from that region. Evolve it to Vivillion to get that form. Some regions are more obscure than others, like Saudi Arabia and Hawaii essentially being their own regions, but it was not too tough to get them all.</p><div class='title'><b>Vivillion Forms in Scarlet/Violet</b></div><p>Prior to the release of Scarlet/Violet, connectivity between Pokemon SV and Pokemon Go had been hinted at with the new pokemon, Gimmighoul. Treasure Chest forms were available in Pokemon SV, while a separate exclusive Roaming form would be available in Pokemon Go. And, with the most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyfyd_t9mzs" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyfyd_t9mzs">Pokemon State of the Union</a>, it was announced how you would do this and it had an extra benefit.</p><p>In order to get Gimmighoul, you need to send a Postcard from Pokemon Go to Pokemon Scarlet/Violet. This gives you a Coin Purse in Pogo that works like an incense. Run the incense and Gimmighoul will spawn for the next 30 minutes. Additionally, every five days you'll get a Golden Lure. In order to evolve Gimmighoul, you need 999 coins, just like Pokemon SV. You get some by catching Gimmighoul, but you get a lot from Poke-stops with Golden Lures.</p><p>Anyways, on the Scarlet/Violet side of things, whichever region was the origin of the Postcard determined which form of Vivillion would spawn over the next 24 hours. Now, it was possible to collect all of the Vivillion forms by yourself! AND, with shiny hunting specific pokemon SO SO easy in Pokemon SV, I decided that this would be my new goal.</p><div class='title'><b>Shiny Vivillion</b></div><p>Vivillion does spawn in the wild up in the north by the Fairy base. My route starts at where the Tera Sylveon spawns. I set down my pickup there, make a Bug Sandwich, and basically drive around in circles spawning and respawning Vivillions. Several other things spawn, too, which is annoying, but I quickly caught my first Shiny Vivillion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230319_vivillion/2023030411044300_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230319_vivillion/2023030411044300_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230319_vivillion/2023030411044300_s.webp" /></p><p>The pattern of Vivillion's wings is identical to its non-Shiny form. The body is the only difference. It's pure white, rather than white and gray. It's difficult to notice at a glance, but when you are paying attention and now what to look for, it is noticeable enough.</p><p>You can only send one postcard from Pokemon Go is a single day. However, you can connect multiple accounts and send multiple Postcards to Scarlet/Violet. I have two main accounts for Pokemon Go, plus an extra one that I only use for extra free stuff. So, I'm able to send 3 postcards in a single day. 18 regional forms with 3 postcards a day. That's only 6 days. :)</p><p>Shiny Hunting is Pokemon SV still depends on random chance, but I can usually get a shiny to spawn within 30 minutes with a sandwich. If not? Just reset the game and try again. Just don't save after making a sandwich unless you get something you want to keep.</p><p>I got my first Shiny Vivillion on March 4th, and now only 2 weeks later, the collection is complete, including the whole evolution family, and a few extras that showed up along the way.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230319_vivillion/2023031621260100_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230319_vivillion/2023031621260100_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230319_vivillion/2023031621260100_s.webp" /></p><p>See all the individual shiny catches in the gallery below.</p><div class='title'><b>Remains</b></div><p>With the 18 regional forms and the base Fancy form, there are 19 total forms available out of a total of 20 in Pokemon SV. Actually, only the regional forms are available in Pokemon Go at the moment. Maybe when Pokemon Home gets an update to include Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, we'll get some way of getting the Fancy form in Go.</p><p>But, it's unclear how the <b>Pokeball Form</b> of Vivillion will be introduced. Previously, it was available through an event only. Although, it makes the most sense that they'd be available through an event in Pokemon Go.</p><p>Maybe for this year's Go Fest, when you spin stops at the event, you'll get a gift, and the postcard for that gift will give you the Pokeball form of Vivillion. Then, transfer that to Scarlet/Violet, and get your Vivillion that way, too.</p><p>Time will tell.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Website Revival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/website-revival">Website Revival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the Spring of 2014, I had finally built the website I had always wanted. Using the Tapestry framework and my web development experience, I wrote a site that could host all of my blog content I had written over the years and be extensible enough to easily change and build whatever I wanted into it. </p><p>I wasn’t manually building pages anymore, like I had been when I first made my website in 2003. My blog content wasn’t orphaned on another server, like when I moved to Movable Type in 2005. And, I was no longer stuck within the constraints of someone else’s design, like when I moved to Wordpress in 2006. </p><p>With my new website, I had built everything from scratch, which gave me complete full control over everything, which gave me the freedom to do anything. It was perfect.</p><p>Almost, anyways.</p><p>Tapestry is a very powerful framework, but for my particular setup at the time, it often crashed. Tapestry ran in Java, so to deploy the site on the Internet, it needed to be run in Tomcat. Once running Tomcat would serve the pages to whomever requested them. But, every two or three days, something within Tapestry or Tomcat would cause the site to be unresponsive. To fix this, I would turn it off and turn it back on again. Not a lot of people actually visited my site, so I don’t think anyone noticed.</p><p>For almost three years, things were pretty good. Though, as usual, my posting became less frequent and I stopped visiting my site as often as before. One day, when I power cycled my website, it was gone. There was nothing on my server. Apparently, a month or two prior, my web server had failed its migration. Well, whatever. All of my code was a mirror of what I had locally. I’ll just copy everything over again and start it up. Not so. My web server had also dropped Java and Tomcat support after this migration. No word about this at all. They just deleted all of my stuff, dropped support, but still billed me every month.</p><p>I looked around a little bit for a new web server. I tried one service, but I couldn’t get the site running. I continued to look around, but Tomcat support had become expensive for some reason. Maybe demand had dropped. I had thought about using cloud servers with Google which would homogenize my Internet eco-system further, but that was also more expensive that what I wanted. Also, it took me a while to figure out how to do it, and I was getting no where.</p><p>So, the site was dead.</p><p>In the last couple of months, I have been doing a lot of programming and using GitHub thanks to the Analogue Pocket. One day I saw that someone had “hosted” their blog on Github. Looking further, you could also have your web domain point to these pages and mask itself as a real website. </p><p>Oh shit. Could I do this?</p><p>GitHub is not a webserver, so it can’t run anything on the backend. Any webpage it hosts, would have to be static. Despite my website running Tapestry, almost all of my content is static. Yes, it uses a database, and Yes, the server is generating pages. But, the result is always the same. Anything that was dynamically generated from the server, could be changed to a separate page or rewritten in Javascript.</p><p>I had often thought that if I could simply make my website a huge mess of HTML pages, then I could easily find hosting and it would absolutely never crash or be inaccessible. And GitHub was answer, because not only could it host these html pages, but it could do it for free.</p><p>It didn’t take me long to find the command line program, WGET. When run, it will crawl through a website and save everything locally. It didn’t take me long to write a <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/src/generate_website.sh">terminal script</a> to save my entire website in HTML into a GitHub directory that could push back to the Github to be hosted.</p><p>There were still some broken links, dynamic links that needed to be changed, and the image gallery that needed to be re-written. A few weeks later, those were all solved. I cleaned up some old posts, and removed some problematic ones from 15+ years ago. I'm also hosting images directly from Google Drive. Now, I’ve written a few new posts to cover some topics from the last year. There are still some posts that I haven't written yet. You can see that progress <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.io/issues/2">on GitHub</a>. I even made a custom <a href="/errorpage" title="/errorpage">error page</a>!</p><p>I think everything is good enough to consider my website reopened. :)</p><p>I first opened theschlock.com in August of 2003, so in just a few more months, it'll be the 20-year anniversary. My life has changed considerably since then, from college, to studying abroad, to working as a software developer, to moving to Japan and working in public schools, to now working in a private school. It's interesting to be able to look back and recall my thoughts during these times.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Application for Permanent Residence" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/permanent-residence">Application for Permanent Residence</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 28, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 10 years ago, I moved to Japan. I didn’t necessarily intend to stay for more than a year or two, but I loved living here and loved teaching students. Teaching had become the most rewarding job I’ve done in my life, so I didn’t want to leave, and it never felt like my time in Japan was complete. Now, this is where I live. A town full of students or parents of students that I’ve helped teach for more than 10 years. And full of friends and connections that I’ve made over the years.</p><p>Now that 10 years has passed, I can apply for Permanent Residence in Japan. In simple terms, Permanent Residence means that I no longer have to renew a work VISA after 3 years and I can buy or build a house. But to me, it means that I’m further established as a part of Japan and don’t intend to leave. It’s the near-equivalent to a Green Card in the US.</p><p>Applying for Permanent Residence is not a simple process of filling out a couple of forms. There are many parts to prove your legal employment, payment of taxes, and contribution to Japan. I spent about a month working on the application back in October, only to have it rejected because I hadn’t lived here a complete 10 years yet. Now, 4 months later, my application is complete and it ended up being 47 pages long.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp"></a></p><p>It was so long that I wrote a Table of Contents describing everything that I included, and sectioned everything into different folders to make it as easy as possible for them to see what I’ve included.</p><p>Here are the table of contents.</p><p>0.      <b>Payment of Fee</b><br/>1.      <b>Application for Permanent Residence</b><br/>2.      <b>Photo</b><br/>3.      <b>Statement of Reason</b><br/>4.      <b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b><br/>5.      <b>Proof of Residence</b><br/>6.      <b>Proof of Employment</b><br/>7.      <b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b><br/>8.      <b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b><br/>9.      <b>Proof of Financial Assets</b><br/>10.    <b>Passport Photo</b><br/>11.    <b>Residence Card Photo</b><br/>12.    <b>Guarantor Information and References</b><br/>13.    <b>Proof of Contributions to Japan</b><br/>14.    <b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b><br/>15.    <b>Application Oath</b></p><p>The instructions for how to apply for permanent residence can be found on the government Immigration website. They are written in <a href="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">English</a> and in <a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">Japanese</a>. My table of contents follows the list of required materials from that page.</p><p>Even though, they have an English version that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to figure out what to do. These instructions are machine translated, and you still need to understand what they’re saying in Japanese because of the specific names for forms, and the specific departments and locations you need to visit. There’s a lot of running around involved getting all the correct documents, so I have detailed everything I did to build my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Payment of Fee</b></div><p>0.      <span class='ja'>手数料</span><br/>This is not required when you submit your application, but it will be required after your application is successful. You must fill out the Payment form and attach an 8000<span class='ja'>円</span> revenue stamp to it. Revenue stamps can be purchased from the post office. Obviously, if you’ve been in Japan long enough, you already know how to do this from renewing your VISA.</p><p>Here’s the payment form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf</a></p><div class='title'><b>Application for Permanent Residence & Photo</b></div><p>1.      <span class='ja'>永住許可申請書</span><br/>2.      <span class='ja'>写真</span><br/>The first document is the application itself. Again, from renewing a VISA, all the same information is here with the addition of a short version of why you want permanent residence, work history, and guarantor information. For my reason, I wrote "I wish to obtain permanent residence to continue teaching in Japan indefinitely and continue my study of kendo and Japanese culture to further enrich myself." It sounds like a lofty reason, but I have fully explained it in the next section.</p><p>Here’s the application form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf</a></p><p>Additionally, you’ll need a 40mm x 30mm photo attached to your application.</p><div class='title'><b>Statement of Reason</b></div><p>3.      <span class='ja'>理由書</span><br/>Perhaps the part of this application that will take the longest is writing about why you want permanent residence in Japan. My short version stated that I wish to teach in Japan indefinitely and continue to learn about Japan, but those ideas are weak unless there is proof. In total, I wrote 3 pages about my time over the last 10 years.</p><p>I started with detailing my current responsibilities and accomplishments working at my high school: supporting English teachers in class, leading English writing classes, being an assistant Homeroom teacher, leading classes to prepare students for studying abroad, training students for speech contests and winning them, and teaching foreign exchange students Japanese language and culture.</p><p>Next, I detailed my accomplishments and responsibilities working in public elementary and junior high schools as part of the JET Programme, such as supporting English classes and training students for speech contests, but also volunteering in town for English conversations classes supporting the hospital and library, developing summer English camp and other events for students, and developing a full English curriculum for elementary schools.</p><p>Also, I detailed my responsibilities as a Regional Prefectural Advisory supporting other ALTs in my region and the prefecture by developing our biannual skills conferences and leading lectures and discussions about lesson planning and ideas, as well as lead monthly meeting for the ALTs in my town.</p><p>Finally, I closed my statement of reason with my contributions to the kendo federation in my town. I wrote about how I joined students in their club activities and practiced kendo, what I learned from doing kendo both personally and professionally, and eventually reaching the rank of 3-dan.</p><p>3 pages might have been too much for a statement of reason, but I wanted to completely show everything noteworthy that I’ve done in Japan. It was very direct and unemotional, focusing on the facts. My approach to writing the statement was very similar to writing a resume for an application. Overall, I don’t think the statement has to be completely emotionless, but I don’t think it should be the main focus of the argument. Show, don’t tell, as I say to my students.</p><p>Even though I wrote all this information in English, I had to rewrite everything in Japanese, too. I had some help with that. I included both English and Japanese versions of my statement in my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b></div><p>4.      <span class='ja'>身分関係を証明する次のいずれかの資料（該当しません）</span><br/>I am not Japanese, so this was not required for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Residence</b></div><p>5.      <span class='ja'>住民票</span><br/>Whenever you move somewhere in Japan, you must register at the town hall so it has a complete and up-to-date record of all of its residents. The application for permanent residence requires a print of this record. It was easy to get from my town’s registrar by filling out a request document and paying 300<span class='ja'>円</span> for them to print the record.</p><p>It has information, such as when you moved to town, current address, previous addresses, nationality, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Employment</b></div><p>6.      <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span><br/>In addition to proving that you live somewhere, you also need to prove that you work somewhere. This was pretty easy for me to get since my school is private and not that big. For a larger organization or a government organization, it might take some time for your request to go open the chain and for the document to come back down.</p><p>I just went to the office and they created a document that proved my employment. Depending on whichever company you work for, it may be an official document or it may not. I think it just needs to include a statement saying you work there as well as information that can be contacted later. My school/company just made up an official looking document with all the correct information on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b></div><p>7.      <span class='ja'>直近（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）の申請人及び申請人を扶養する方の所得及び納税状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Things start to get more complicated, as a single piece of paper proving your employment isn’t enough. Of course, you need to show that you’ve been paying taxes on the income that you’ve earned. And also show that you’ve been doing it for at least five years.</p><p>These documents include the <I>Kazei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>課税証明書</span> and the <I>Nozei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span>. Both documents translate as either Tax Certificate or Taxation Certificate, so looking at the English information about this section may not be helpful. Overall, the <I>Kazei</I> Tax Certificate details how much taxes you had to pay and what taxes you had to pay on your income within a given year. The <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate details the amount of taxes you still owe for a given year. Essentially, <I>Kazei</I> is like an itemized bill, and <I>Zozei</I> is the receipt.</p><p>Each document you’ll need for 5 years. For my town, I had a single <I>Kazei</I> Certificate for each year. For the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate, each year could be written on the same document. For each document, for each year, it cost 300<span class='ja'>円</span>. So for all the documents, my bill would’ve been 3000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>However, <I>update</I>, when I initially turned in my application, I forgot to get 5 years for the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate. I was able to turn in my application, but I needed to mail in the correct form within two weeks. They gave me an envelope and a sheet that described the document I was missing. Another problem, though: my town only keeps the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate up to 4 years, instead of the 5 years they wanted. I called them, and they said 4 years was fine. So, my bill was actually 2700<span class='ja'>円</span> for these documents.</p><p>Additionally! There’s another version of the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate that is required. Besides the Tax Record office in city hall, I went to my town’s official Tax Office. Requesting the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate from them shows them I’ve paid all debts and taxes across all government departments and agencies, as well as never missed any payment for any bills or loan. This document cost 500<span class='ja'>円</span> to print.</p><p>In addition, to these tax documents, I had to include a photo of my bank book that proved I was getting paid the correct income.</p><p>So, for this section, I included the following documents:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>課税証明書（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）</span>- Kazei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - Nozei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書（未払いの税金がないことを証明するためのパート</span>3<span class='ja'>）</span>- Nozei Cert proving no upaid taxes<br/>·        <span class='ja'>預貯金通帳（写し）</span>- Photo proving income.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b></div><p>8.      <span class='ja'>申請人の公的年金及び公的医療保険の保険料の納付状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Now that I had shown that I am legally employed, getting legally paid, and responsibly paying taxes on my legal income, I need to show that I’m paying into either my company’s pension or the government’s pension for at least two years. Also that I have health insurance.</p><p>This section was somewhat difficult to follow. Initially, I just took a photo copy of my annual pension report that I had gotten in mail, but (<I>update!</I>) apparently that wasn’t enough. A few days after I turned in my application, I got a letter in the mail requesting another form. The form they wanted detailed all of my pension payments, and each pension that I’ve contributed to. It was called the <I>Hihokenja Chousho Shoukai Kaitou-hyou</I> <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span> or the “Insurance Record Inquiry Report,” I think? I’m not sure why it says insurance when its about pensions.</p><p>To get this form, I had to go to my town’s Pension office and request these forms. Prior to going to the office, I had some co-workers give them a call to make sure I was getting the right forms, and they were able to prepare everything for me before I arrived. It turned a possible 40-minute wait into 5 minutes. This document was also 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Looking at this document, I’ve contributed into a government pension when I worked for the city as a teacher, and I’ve contributed to a private pension I have with my current job. </p><p>The letter wanted me to include receipts from any contributions to the government’s individual pension service, but I never did that, so I didn’t have any.</p><p>For the health insurance card, I just took a photo of it and blacked out the account number.</p><p>So, this is what I included from this section:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>ねんきん定期便（写し）</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>健康保険被保険者証（写し）</span></p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Financial Assets</b></div><p>9.      <span class='ja'>申請人又は申請人を扶養する方の資産を証明する次のいずれかの資料</span><br/>For the next part, I had to show all of Japanese financial assets. At minimum, I had to take photo copies of my bank statements to show how much money I have in Japan. I don’t have a house, so I didn’t have anything to show there. I do have a car, but I didn’t include any proof of that. Maybe I should have?</p><div class='title'><b>Passport Photo and Residence Card Photo</b></div><p>10.      <span class='ja'>申請人のパスポート（写し）</span><br/>11.      <span class='ja'>申請人の在留カード（写し）</span><br/>I included photo copies of my passport and residence card with my application, but this is not really necessary. When you turn in your application, you’ll need to also show them both of these, and they can take a photo copy themselves, at this time. I included these to save time.</p><div class='title'><b>Guarantor Information and References</b></div><p>12.      <span class='ja'>身元保証に関する資料</span><br/>A current Japanese citizen needs to vouch for who I am, what I stand for, and state that I would make a contribution to Japan by becoming a Japanese permanent resident. This person should be someone you know pretty well, and have a good relationship with. My principal at school has always sponsored my VISA, as well as other documents that required official clearance, so he was an easy choice as a guarantor.</p><p>They need to fill in the guarantor form and prove who they are. For my guarantor, we included the following:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>身元保証書</span> - the guarantor application<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証</span> - a photo copy of their ID (driver’s license, in this case)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span> - proof of employment, wherever they work.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - proof of tax payments. (<I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>住民票</span> - proof of residence.</p><p>Here’s the guarantor form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf</a> (Japanese)<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Contributions to Japan</b></div><p>13.      <span class='ja'>我が国への貢献に係る資料（</span>※<span class='ja'>ある場合のみで結構です。）</span><br/>This is the last meaty section of the application. For this section, I included my letters of recommendation and other certificates and awards of accomplishments. </p><p>In the end, I had 3 recommendation letters: one letter from the principal, one letter from the head of our English department, and one letter from head of the Kendo federation in my town. Each letter of recommendation talked about the contributions that I made to my school and kendo in town, and talked about why they think I should be awarded permanent residence.</p><p>Additional documents that I included were proof of things mentioned in either my Statement of Reason or their Letters of Recommendation. I included a photo of my kendo license showing participation for 10 years, my 3-dan diploma, and certificates of participation for 3 years in the international budo conference. I also included a photo of my driver’s license to show that not only do I have a license, but maintaining a perfect and safe driving record to be awarded a 5-year gold license.</p><p>All in all, here were my documents for this section.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from principal)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from head of English)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from Kendo Federation)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>剣道免許（写し）</span>- Kendo License Photo<br/>·        <span class='ja'>剣道</span>３<span class='ja'>段免許（写し）</span>- Kendo 3-dan Diploma<br/>·        <span class='ja'>国際武道文化セミナー</span> <span class='ja'>修了証</span> <span class='ja'>（</span>３<span class='ja'>年分）</span> - International Budo Conference particpation<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証（写し）</span>- Photo of Gold Driver’s License</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b></div><p>14.      <span class='ja'>身分を証する文書等（該当しません）</span><br/>I’m not Japanese, so I did not need to do this. </p><p>I’m not sure if this one is proof of ancestry or identity, or what the difference is between part 4 above. For one of these, there is some kind of official family document Japanese people have that shows all of their registered family members, and you need to include a photo copy of it.</p><div class='title'><b>Application Oath</b></div><p>15.      <span class='ja'>了解書　</span>１<span class='ja'>通</span><br/>The final document required is signing the application oath form. By signing this, you agree that if anything information within the application changes over the next 4 to 6 months, you must notify immigration about these changes and update your application.</p><p><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001356126.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001356126.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001356126.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Complete!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503_t.webp"></a></p><p>That’s everything. It doesn’t really seem like all that much once I finished making everything and putting it together. However, a lot of the time spent on the application is figuring out exactly what is required and where to go. The tax and pensions details are pretty tricky. I think my situation is pretty easy because I’ve only had the one job in the last 5 years, and the job is run by a professional organization. I also don’t have a house. Although, getting those documents probably aren’t too tough.</p><p>On February 13th, I drove up north to Toyama and turned in my application at Toyama Branch Office of the Nagoya Regional Immigration Bureau. A long time ago, I figured out that very few people actually go to this branch office, so the wait time is never more than 5 minutes. In Gifu, wait times can be as long as 45 minutes. And in Nagoya, a friend of mine waited for an hour and a half once.</p><p>Again, the clerk instantly noticed one probably with my application (the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate not being 5 years), so I had to submit that afterward. I also got a letter in the mail on February 17th about the pension document. But, they accepted my application, and I’ve mailed those requested document as soon as I could. All documents were submitted as of February 21st, and I have not received any more letters about any more problems.  I think it’s all good!</p><p>Typically these application can take up to six months to be completely reviewed and responded to, but the clerk mentioned that it may only take three months to be complete. Over the last three years, thanks to Covid, the number of people moving to Japan has significantly decreased because the government shut down travel.  Previously, my VISA application would take 4 weeks to get approved, but it only took a week last year.</p><p>Hopefully, by May, I’ll get the postcard in the mail to come back down and get my card. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Arrival - Dual Language Subtitles" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/arrival-dual-language-subtitles">Arrival - Dual Language Subtitles</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Its ideas of language learning and development significant struck me because deal with the differences of language and culture on a daily basis in my life and my work living in a foreign country.</p><p>I wrote about these ideas before, and how they inspired me to talk about them to my junior high school classes at the time. You can read them here: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival thoughts from February 2017</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" /></p><p>This year, once again, I'm using this film in my classes to talk about language and learning. My high school class will watch the whole film, and try to understand how the idea of environment and thinking determines the language that society speaks.</p><p>The purpose of the assignment is to understand the ideas the film discusses and not focus so much on the direct translation of what is said. Therefore, I needed Japanese subtitles for the film. English subtitles are pretty easy to find online, but almost every other language is a mixed-bag of low quality machine generated garbage. Japanese subtitles even moreso because of how distant it is from English.</p><p>So, I created a subtitle file that has both English and Japanese, timed perfectly with each other, and each line of dialogue having complete sentences and meaning side-by-side.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view">drive/ Arrival.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG].EnJpDual.ass</a></p><p>I didn't completely translate it myself. I found some Japanese subtitles already created. But, it had several errors and several timings were wrong. All of those problems have been fixed and timed perfectly with the English script.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" /></p><p>The subtitles are in ASS format because SRT does not support dual languages. ASS overwrites size and color, so you'll need to modify the file if you want to change any of that. Although, the size is specifically set for some long sentences to fit perfectly, so I would recommend not enlarging them.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket Extras" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-extras">Analogue Pocket Extras</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 31, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of 2020, Pokemon Go announced that you’d finally be able to go beyond the level 40 cap all the way up to level 50. I started playing Pokemon Go in the beginning in 2016, but I didn’t really seriously start playing it until 2018, and I started a second account and played them both at the same time. My primary account was ahead of my secondary, but it didn’t take long for it to catch up and have pokemon teams just as powerful. After a few months, both accounts were essentially mirrors of each other.</p><p>By the end of 2020, my primary account was able to hit level 40, but my secondary account still lagged behind.  In order to reach level 40, you need a total of 20 million XP in the game. I think my primary was at 25 million at that point? And my secondary may have been at 18 million.</p><p>With the increased level caps set, you’ll now need a total of 176 million XP to reach level 50. In fact, the gap between level 49 and level 50 alone with 30 million XP. With these requirements and my current progress, I resigned myself that it would take years upon years to actually get there.</p><p>In the end, it only took 2 years and a month.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">DyreSchlock - Jan 29th<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - Jan 31st<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Both of my accounts hit level 50 last week after a long 7 months of being stuck on level 49.  In addition to needed XP to gain a level, you also have unique level requirements, like hatching some amount of eggs, or defeating some amount of rocket members. Level 49 requires you land 1000 excellent throws on Pokemon, which is very time consuming and annoying if you don’t manually play so often. I was able to grind them out with the most recent Electric event, though.</p><p>So, if it took me more than two years prior to 2021 to gain 20 million XP, how was I able to get more than 150 million in just two years? Overall, 3 main factors contributed to my XP, but a few other things also changed how I played.</p><div class='title'><b>XP Gains</b></div><p>First, as the level cap was raised, so was the XP you gain for doing various things in the game. Catching Pokemon gave you a little more. Spinning stops gave you a little bit. Defeating Raid bosses gave you a little more. And, most notably, excellent throws now gave you 1000xp.  Before, I think it was 200xp.</p><p>Second, additionally, evolving Pokemon now gave you 1000xp, too. Throughout the weeks, as I caught a lot of Pokemon, if I could evolve them, I would put them into their own group. There are many Pokemon in the game, and many of these Pokemon are not useful in battles. Because of this, I’d just throw them away to make room to catch more. But, if I have a lot of candy for those Pokemon, may as well make them useful by evolving them for the XP. When you use a Lucky Egg, you’ll get double XP for the next 30 minutes. AND! I logged into a single account using both of my phones. I could evolve double the amount of Pokemon and get double the amount of XP. <b>In 30 minutes, I could get about 750 thousand XP</b>. I caught enough Pokemon that I could do this every 2 or 3 weeks.</p><p>Thirdly, the absolute best way to get XP in the game is through friendships. After 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days, you’ll increase your friendship level for 10 thousand, 50 thousand, and 100 thousand XP. Use a Lucky Egg to double it. Making friends in Pokemon go wasn’t easy to begin with, but it became very easy when they introduced Remote Raids. Other people built match making apps where you friend each other to do raids. After hosting MANY MANY raids, I continue to send gifts to people and increase friendships. Every 2 or 3 weeks when I did evolves, I would get the XP from friendships, too. After one of these sessions, I would routinely make around 1.5 million. One night, I made more than 5 million.</p><div class='title'><b>Play Style</b></div><p>Those were specific things I did to significantly increase my level, but overall, my play style is much different than it was prior to 2021 and the game has changed a lot, too.</p><p>The main way my play style changed was using these two things:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" /></p><p>The Pokeball Plus was released in 2018 with the release of Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee, and meant to be used as a controller, but you could also connect it to Pokemon Go. When connected it will automatically spin stops for you. Also, when you're near a Pokemon you can click the button to try to catch it. Well, if you buy those rubber protectors above and shove a coin or two over the button, the button will automatically be pressed down and it will automatically catch a Pokemon.</p><p>With these two Pokeballs, I can turn on Pokemon Go, turn on the Pokeballs, and it will automatically capture Pokemon as I drive around town. This is an amazing efficient way of getting a lot of Pokemon very quickly and catching a lot of Pokemon that I wouldn't have caught otherwise. It's not a 100% catch rate, but it's still doing a lot more work than I would have to do manually, and it frees me up to focus on driving and moving around.</p><p>As time goes on, the radius that allows you to spin stops was increased and the overall number of pokemon that spawn has increased, too. I'm catching far more Pokemon than I ever had before.</p><div class='title'><b>Level History</b></div><p>It didn't take too long for both of my accounts to go through level 41, 42, 43, etc. Once I hit the mid-40s, I would take about a month or two or three to make it to the next level before I finally hit level 49. Each time you gain a level past 40, you have the option of saving your stat sheet, so I saved all of these images when I could.  Here are my past few levels as a comparison.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">DyreSchlock - June 12th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - June 16th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column">DyreSchlock - March 29th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - May 7th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column">DyreSchlock - Dec 25th 2021<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - Feb 26th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>End Game</b></div><p>Maybe they'll increase the level cap again in the future, but I doubt it. There's no real benefit of having your character reach level 50 compared with level 40. Once you hit level 35, you can boost your individual Pokemon to level 50, so it doesn't matter what level you are.</p><p>Lately, I've been playing Pokemon Go more casually and only focusing on certain events. Part of the reason it took me 7 months to gain a level was because I was barely playing the game. It's always fun to explore around town playing Pokemon Go, but with one less goal overall, it is one less reason to play, and that's a good thing. I can focus on other stuff instead.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/9">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/7">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
