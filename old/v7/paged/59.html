| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year has been fantastic for movies.  Cloverfield.  Speed Racer.  Dark Knight.  I just got back from my second viewing of Pineapple Express.  Fantastic!  Summer is winding down, though.  The air has become chill.  And all the kids are back in town for college.  The year is not quite over, but there's still one movie left that I eagerly anticipate.  That's <b>Choke</b>.</p><p>9 years ago, <b>Fight Club</b> introduced me to the satirical dark writing of Chuck Palahniuk.  Throughout those 9 years, I've read all his novels, watched Fight Club a billion times, and even seen him in person.  Fight Club made me an instant fan.  It brought my from cinema into novels and even fosters some creative writing from time to time.  I'd probably be playing video games on the bus if not for Fight Club, really.</p><p>Anywho, 9 years later, another of Chuck's books has finally made it to theaters.  Choke opens September 26th in select theaters, but some people have already seen it at various film festivals.  And from what it looks like, there are some haters out there.  The negative reviews seem to have a similar tone... 'It ain't Fight Club'.  Well, it's funny you should mention that...</p><p>Fight Club has a very distinct tone throughout the movie.  It's a very dark dank vision of society and the people around you.  Putting on a polite show for humanity, despite feeling completely empty and emotionless.  Then starting to break out of your shell just a little with growing confidence in yourself as a person.  This distinct thought process is beautifully translated from the book into film.  When I read the novel, I feel like I'm inside the main character's head.  The same way you are in most of the film.</p><p>After I read Fight Club, I went right on to the next book.  I read Survivor, Choke, Lullaby, Invisible Monsters, and Diary.  Each one carried this same tone.  Each novel placed you deep into the main character's thought process, feelings and emotions.  As I read each novel, I felt completely in tune with the main character.  Choke felt very much like Fight Club.  Only a different setting, different character background, different vices.</p><p>3 months ago, I saw Chuck Palahniuk in Minneapolis for the release of his recent novel, Snuff.  During the event, they played the trailer for Choke.  I was excited.  Even more excited than I had been from just being at the event to begin with.</p><p>However, after viewing the trailer, I felt very conflicted.  It was absolutely nothing like how I pictured it in my mind.  As you can see for yourself, the tone is completely comical.  poppy.  funny on the outside.  Complete opposite emotions I felt when reading the book.  Not Like Fight Club.</p><p>So, I watched the trailer and the red band trailer a bunch of times and went back to read the book.  I read the book from the mindset of a comedy movie.  Maybe I just read it wrong?  Perhaps Fight Club was pushing my expectations into the deep dark mood because the movie effected me in such a way.  Maybe this is a strictly comedic book.</p><p>Naw.  The timing is totally off in the book.  The focus is clearly the emotions and thinking of the main character, Victor Mancini.  The little one liner jokes in the trailer are completely moved around to make it a comedy.</p><p>But!  Then again, these are fricken trailers.  Trailers are created by production staff to promote the movie to as wide an audience as possible.  Thinking back to 9 years ago, I thought Fight Club was garbage from the TV spots I saw.  I only saw it later on DVD when my friends made me watch it.  The overall feeling of the book or movie can't be easily illustrated in a 3 minute clip.</p><p>I'm still totally stoked for Choke, though.  I think I'm going into the film with a unique perspective that I have never  had with any movie I've seen before.  I think this'll be the first movie where I've read the book way in advance from the film being announced.  It's exciting to see the movie adaptation clash with my imagination.  For some reason I imagined the characters a lot skinnier...  Especially Paige Marshall.</p><p>4 more weeks!</p><p>Check out both trailers on the <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/" title="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/">Official Site</a>.  The can be a little tricky to find though.  Go to the restricted area, then go to videos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Scanner Darkly" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/scanner-darkly">Scanner Darkly</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today is Sunday, but it's not a normal Sunday.</p><p>I'm on a couch.  No, not my own couch.  I don't even own a couch.  It's a friend's couch and I'm stayed at his apartment last night.  He and I aren't the only ones here either.  Many friends of ours came to visit him.  We went to the massive drinking party known as Irish fest.  As usual, I drank more than my share, but I had a great time.  Drinking and Dancing.  I remember pretty much all of it.  The only part that escapes me where my steps exiting the gates and arriving to the couch.</p><p>But, it's now Sunday.  A very hazy Sunday.</p><p>Waking up is always a chore when your body feels wrecked.  All of us in the room, feel the same, so I'm in equal company.  It puts me in a good mood.  A grand time experienced by us all.  Time is short, though.  My bus back to Madison is in a few hours.  And my ride to the bus time is even sooner.  I shower and pack and off we go.  My friend has a very busy day so he drops me off with a good hour before the bus arrives.  Luckily, there's a Perkins nearby.</p><p>Sunday is a very popular day.  It's the most popular day for Perkins.</p><p>With half an hour before noon, the Perkins is filled with after-Church goers.  Many seniors with their best set of clothes on their old bodies.  Many children in their best Sunday dress or slacks.  Families, both old and young.  And me.  Standing in the entrance-way holding a backpack full of worn clothes and shampoo.  Holding another bag with my computer and other personal belongings.  Alone.  With slightly damp untied hair down past my shoulders.</p><p>Table for one, please...   Jim.</p><p>To the inquisitive population my mouth moves and spews out those words.  My eyes wander to the table of grandmas nearest to me.  Then they dart back across the restaurant to the front counter to catch a name tag.  Kim.  Slowing moving across the assortment of pies and muffins under glass.  I am a bit hungry, but that's way too much sugar for the morning.  That muffin is larger than my fist.</p><p>Should be about a 15 minute wait.</p><p>I figured that would be obvious from the crowds of lightly colored dressed people.  I find a bench and set my things down.  There are three other groups of people waiting beside me in this green and black carpeted foyer area.  Two of these groups are a single couple.  Both young men taking their girlfriends or wives to an early afternoon meal.  The other group could be either couple in 10 or 15 years.  A middle aged father in jeans with a ratty shirt with a Beer logo on it.  A wife with a big blonde pony-tail, jeans and jean-jacket combo holding a generic baby carrier with two screaming children using their mom as an obstacle for whatever game they're playing.  I smile, but inside I can't stop laughing.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>15 minutes later, the half-dead elderly couple had thoroughly scrapped themselves out of a booth for me.  I feign sincerity as they pass by.  I lift up my belongings and follow Kim to a now lonely booth by the window.  Such a waste.  Isn't there a smaller table for just one person?  Am I really expected to fill this 4 person space?  I complain to myself, but say only thanks.  My bags take up all the room next to me.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Quickly, A young short woman greets me.  She's incredibly perky for a Sunday morning.  Morning to me, anyways.  Hi, I reply.  She asks me if I want anything to drink.  Milk, I reply.  She asks me what size.  Large, I reply.  And what would you like to order today, She asks with a smile.  What's with all these questions.  So fast.  I hardly had anytime to look at the menu, let alone think a response.  Can I get a water too, I reply.  Sure thing, do you want a minute or two to look at the menu, She asks with a smile.  Yep, I reply.  And off she goes bouncing around with her blond pony tail swaying from side to side.</p><p>What <i>was</i> up with all those questions?  Do single patrons always know automatically what they wish to order?  Oh geez, I wonder what I was suppose to say...  Well, at least I can figure out what to order before she comes back.  I want an omelet of sorts.  Nothing else really looks as fine to me at this hour.  That's what I'll say when she returns.  And I'll practice it in my head a couple times so it doesn't sound weird.  Ugh, that's weird in of itself.</p><p>I bet that grandma over there think I'm weird.  Why is that gentlemen alone, she must wonder.  She probably asks herself a lot of useless questions like that.</p><p>The cheery waitress returns with my drinks and asks the question I've already answered in my head a couple times now.  I want an omelet of sorts.  What kind of sorts, she inquires.  One with tomatoes, mushrooms, veggies, and these two cheeses.  Splendid, she says with a smile.  You also get a muffin and some breakfast potatoes.  Splendid indeed.  And off she goes to put her scribblings up in the kitchen for the minimum wage chef.</p><p>I don't normally talk that way.  In fact, can I even be sure that really just happened?  Now I don't have anything to stare at with the menu gone.  Perhaps now is the best time to finally that book I've been reading.</p><p>Scanner Darkly</p><p>I've seen the movie before.  I've owned the movie for a while now.  And have watched it several times.  But the book is incredible.  Bob Arctor is truly beside himself in ways that the movie simply did not convey.  He is paranoid and a drug addict.  He feels he's doing the right thing by working for the police and spying on his friends.  His dark dank life is injected with a little good through himself.  But Bob Arctor is also Fred.  The undercover law enforcement officer spying on Bob Arctor and his friends.  What despicable lives they have.</p><p>Bob Arctor continuously takes Substance D as a stress reliver, recreational activity, and... well, just because it's there really.  He's addicted.  And the overuse of Substance D causes his brain to split.  The two hemispheres reveal conflicting information.  One side is Bob Arctor, the depressed drug addicted loser.  The other is Fred, the crappy undercover cop who's really wasting the government's time.</p><p>Reading the book reveals the full picture of Bob Arctor and his friends.  The movie is really just excerptse from the book.  Carefully chosen and edited scenes picture perfect from the text to paint a cohesive story that leaves several details out.  Details that didn't really matter to the story, but gave more insight to Bob Arctor and his growing paranoia.</p><p>I like this book a lot.  The whole 60s/70s lingo is fun too.</p><p>This is the first book written by Philip K Dick I've read, and I plan to continue read more.  But I get the feeling they won't live up to this one.  I'm not really a big fan of Sci Fi novels.  I think Sci Fi novels focus too much on the science fiction of the environment rather than the characters...  and so forth.  I love reading about the characters and what they're thinking during events.</p><p>Here ya go, sweetie.</p><p>Excellent.  Eggs, Veggies and little breakfast potatoes.  I consume them while getting closer to the ending.  The perfect meal for this Sunday.  I get my muffin to go and say Goodbye to the lovely waitress with a handsome tip.  The sun is slightly higher in the sky and I have 30 minutes before the bus arrives.  Through the window, I see the waitress bouncing around from one table to the next.  Across the street, I see my destination.  The bus stop.</p><p>Over the road and across the parking lot to the Goerke's Corner I go.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent

The world is split up into 6 worlds in which you use Time as the main catalyst to advance and collect puzzle pieces.  The basic premise of the story is fairly standard at first.  Tim is looking for the princess, and with the completion of each world, is told the princess is in another castle.</p><p>On the surface that is all this game is.  Hopping, Skipping and Jumping.  Standard gameplay mechanics until you begin realizing your actions as the player.  You're killing endless amounts of these golems to achieve success.  To regain a puzzle piece piecing together a lost memory.  Once you've collected the pieces and assembled the puzzle, the memory is complete.  Yes, you have been here and these were your actions.</p><p>The next puzzle complete and the next puzzle complete.  You descend into madness searching for your lost princess.  Where is she?!  You are obsessed.  No one will stand in my way.  She is my princess and how dare you hide her from me.  Your senseless evil monsters will not win.  You can't win.  I am the true hero.</p><p>Thus it continues.  The senseless murder continues until it is complete.  You cannot find her in the present.  Your future is void without her.  The past is the key.  You've been using Time all along to find her.  It's time to go back to where it began.  That single night.</p><p>Backwards on that day with death following you.  When we worked together with the one goal of being reunited.  It was then when I finally reached your window and peered at you asleep that you screamed and ran.  I tried to catch up..  I tried to catch you.  And you tried to kill me.  You ran away.  But I will find you.  Nothing will come in my way.</p><p>There had to be something missing in all my memories.  Very hidden hints of something larger.  Those pesky stars in which I cheated to find.  With nearly all of them, I cannot only relive the event of that day, but change it slightly to obtain her.  And that is what I did.  And now all that is around me is on fire.  A smile crept onto my face.  But I had to ask myself, 'Is this what I thought happiness would be'?</p><p>____</p><p>Tim is a psycho.  The world that you control his actions appears like a cutesy little video game in Tim's eyes.  But what are his actions in real life.  How many doors have you broken into?  How many grizzly townfolk have you trampled?  How many kingdoms have you crumbled?

When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera in the Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/opera-in-the-park">Opera in the Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Opera in the Park, Brat Fest, Rhythm and Booms..  Art fair on the Square was pretty well attended too.  What other traditional Madison festivals and fairs are there?  At the end of the night, they announced that over 13,000 people were there which is pretty incredible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" /></p><p>The event started around 8pm and went on into the night.  The first two songs that began with I had heard in one form or another before hand, but had never heard the actual song.  Largo al factotum (the figaro song) and Anvil Chorus I remember from Looney Tunes. ^_^  The figaro song is also usually heard in commercials too.  Usually spaghetti sauce commercials.  I think it's kinda funny that the height of my opera experience was from other forms of media using it either poorly or commercially, but at least I had some exposure to it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was the perfect day for laying in the park listening to some fantastic music. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Madama Butterfly</b></div><p>Despite not knowing anything about Opera, there is one opera that I know of thanks to Asian American Literature at Platteville and that is Madama Butterfly.  I think we read the original short story, Madame Butterfly, the opera was based on.  It was rather brief, but gave us the background needed to start reading M. Butterfly, which is a play inspired by the book.</p><p>Madame Butterfly is about a Japanese Geisha woman in Nagasaki known to her friends as Butterfly.  She meets an US sailor, Pinkerton, who's ship is in town.  They fall in love and get married, but Pinkerton must return to the states.  The main emotion of the story is Butterfly's longing and loyality to Pinkerton as she continues to work as a Geisha   She continues to wait and wait and wait for his return, despite her friends constantly telling her that he's never going to return.  That he doesn't love her and it was just a little fling for him.  She continues to believe in Pinkerton.  AND.. Many twists and turns happen when Pinkerton finally returns to Nagasaki.</p><p>M. Butterfly is an interesting parallel tale of love between the actors who portrey the characters in a similar opera featuring cross-dressing and John Lithgow.</p><p>Anywho, Madama Butterfly is being performed by the Madison Opera in November!  I'm totally going.  I think I'll try to read the books again beforehand.  They also have a preview/lecture about the play a week before that'll probably be interesting, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Protomen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-protomen">The Protomen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Comedy is the only genre where lyrics are the focal point, but in other genres, the lyrics are basically there to mask the poor music performance going on behind the singer.  Lyrics give you a biased opinion of what the song is supposed to about, rather than having the song relay that message on its own.  You should be able to dip into the music like a pool of emotion and float along with everyone else.</p><p>This is why I hate nearly all music.  As a kid, I hated Pop and Rock..  I couldn't stand it.  It just sounded like a bunch of noise with no cohesion and poorly crafted lyrics that were inaudible.  Some of my friends started getting me into Electronica which built itself on repetition, layers and absolutely no lyrics in the way..  It was the first time I actually started listening to music, rather than just hearing it.</p><p>After understanding music a little more, lyrics are still pretty annoying, but work incredibly well with some songs.  Electronica is historically known for having the worst written lyrics, but they're always easier to learn.  Then you can add your own noise to the aural atmosphere.  You are right there with the singer and everyone else chanting the lyrics.  The lyrics are generally strategically placed in the song to build on the mood rather than tell you how to feel.</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics aren't that bad</b></div><p>The Protomen is a metal/garage rock opera.  It's a 38 minute story in 7 parts that <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen-frequency" title="/the-protomen-frequency">I wrote about before</a>.  It tells of Protoman's epic struggle and death, and Megaman's rise to follow in his footsteps and eventually confront him circa Megaman 3.</p><p>Each lyric is a sentence of the story that serves telling this story and flowing in harmony with the guitars, keyboards and drums.  The lyrics are another instrument in this symphony that is not more or less important than another.  I've rarely heard lyrics used this way before. ^_^  Maybe that's because the lyrics are telling a story with an overall emotion rather than constantly explaining that emotion.</p><p>Anywho..

The water was cool compared to the warmed up sands.</p><p>However, I was incredibly careful...  The entire time I was thinking about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc">this youtube video</a> and another video of a guy sinking in mud or quicksand really fast and completely vanished.

Until, I stopped thinking about it...  and sunk down past my knees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't running or anything, so I was right near the edge of the solid sandy surface and the mud pit, so pulling myself out was pretty easy.  The whole time I kept slowing sinking down and kept saying to myself, "stop stop stop stop stop...  holy crap."  Luckily I had already taken my sandals off or I probably would've had to buy new ones.  Though my sandals probably kept my "afloat" longer having a larger area to step on rather than the thin area my feet cover.</p><p>I didn't stray too far from shore after that. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, Lake Delton is pretty screwed..  It probably looked like hell after it initially drained with all the dead fish corpses and more perilous mud pits.  There's a new article today that said crews are beginning to repair the dam this week, so it might be fixed by next year.  I wonder what it'll look like in winter.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Leinenkugel's" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/leinenkugels">Leinenkugel's</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Zach got a fancy internship at Cray Computers for the summer, but has found that working in the middle of nowhere leads to much loneliness.  I saw Dark Knight with him on the way up, and with a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon ahead of us, we went to the Leinenkugel's Brewery which is also in Chippewa Falls.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" /></p><p>It was quite quaint but also pretty fancy too.</p><div class='title'><b>Leinie Lodge</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" /></p><p>The main public facility in the Leinie Lodge which is a big gift shop and also the place to sign up for a tour of the brewery itself.  Inside they had tons of crappy merchandise.  They put the Leinie logo on nearly everything..  from postcards to notebooks to fishing tackle to shirts to chairs to rulers to hold punchers to anything really.</p><p>It was really annoying because it took me forever to find a keychain bottle opener to match my New Glarus one.  I should've picked up a pint glass to match my New Glarus ones too, but I didn't think of it.  It doesn't really matter though, since those glasses were kinda ugly.</p><p>We signed up for the tour and off we went an hour later.</p><div class='title'><b>Brewery</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" /></p><p>This here is the main bottling facility which is where 100% of the tour went.  We went up and down the elevator a couple times to the 4 floors that serviced the actually creation of the beer.  The mixing of the hops, wheat and all that crap I wasn't paying attention to..</p><p><b>Fact</b>: They still add their active and flavoring ingredients by hand during the process, which allows them to still fall in the category of a Craft Brewery.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Also, they employ less than 52 workers at any given time to also keep this status.</p><p>We went got outside and went into another portion of the building that serviced bottling and then shipping.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Every single bottle or can or keg produced by the brewery has been ordered in advance. They never make more than what is already spoken for.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: A good chunk of their workers are hired help for the summer from local colleges.  This is why they have a bunch of summer and fall beers, but not many winter and spring beers.</p><p>I learned a few things, but that was pretty much it.  It was a neat tour and the tour guide was cute.  Zach started talking with her quite a bit as the tour ended about this and that. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Comparing tastes...</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" /></p><p>The whole area of the brewery was really nice.  Plenty of trees throughout the facility, and a babbling brouk passing between the Leinie lodge and the Brewery.  It was more pleasant than the other two brewerys I've been to.</p><p>The New Glarus Brewery is alright..  but it's really small.  The tours are self guided, so you can show up at anytime and walk through the place.  They give you a little phone thingy you can punch numbers into when you see them on the wall, but it's all rather useless info.  The giftshop had useful things and actually sold the beer, though.</p><p>Times are changing though, as New Glarus has just expanded to open up their much larger facility on the other side of the town.  From the road, it looks probably just as big as the Leinie brewery.  They still plan on keeping their original brewery open for their craft beers, but will use the new facility for more mass production.</p><p>The other brewery I've been to is the Asahi Beer Factory in Fukuoka, Japan, which is absolutely different than these two.  The Asahi Brewery is massive.  Bigger than most Wal*marts I've been to.  The production is super fast and their volume is huge.  It definitely lacked the heart of our wisconsin brewerys, though..  Also, I couldn't understand what the hell the guide was talking about.</p><div class='title'><b>Local is better</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" /></p><p>Overall, I'd say this has been the best Brewery Tourery I've been on.  The Leinie's brewery has a lot more history than New Glarus but still keeps everything down to earth.  I still like New Glarus' Spotted Cow over anything that Leinie's has, but Leinie is a great goto beer.  You can find it nearly everywhere and it never lets you down. ^_^</p><p>Leinie's Octoberfest beer should start showing up at retailers in the next few weeks, so that'll replace Spotted Cow for me for a little while. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure what other brewerys I'd like to check out next..  maybe I'll go to Ireland and check out Guiness or something.  I'd like to go back to the Asahi Beer factory and get a keychain bottle opener to match my other ones.  I'm sure I'll find myself somewhere.</p><p>As another note, Zach and I came across a tanning salon with a must hilarious name:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/60">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/58">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
