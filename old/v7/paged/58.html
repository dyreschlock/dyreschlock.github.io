| October 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week saw the release of Beautiful Katamari..  a game series that I hold close to my heart, but not close enough that I would spend the $40 budget price tag of the next-generation to own it..  Not right now anyways..  I'd take advantage of that Toys R Us deal, but I can't find a third act to follow :/</p><p>Distraught and disappointed, I came home and decided to start playing some PSP games..  but I was looking for something a little more than just an hour of a puzzle rhythm game.  Out of my 20 PSP games, I'd say 14 are not very involved games.. so that narrowed the field down.</p><p>I had Valkyrie Profile, Metal Gear Solid, Generation of Chaos, Final Fantasy VII and one other story driven game that really caught my eye: Gurumin.  subtitle: a monsterous adventure.</p><div class='title'><b>Appeal</b></div><p>This was one of those games that looked like I would really like it just from looking at the cover.  It had a funny super-deformed character with several other colorful characters behind lighting up the canvas with intrigue.  I took a look at the back of the box, and it looked like some medievil adventure style game.  A very japanese non-mainstream title..</p><p>When gamestop marked Gurumin down to $20 back in May, I gladly picked it up.  Kinda sad when a game gets reduced in price 50% 3 months after release.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Gurumin is about a girl named Parin.  Parin had just moved to a quite mining town in the middle of no where populated only by adults.  Or so it seemed, after running around town she comes across a little child being harassed by a dog.  Parin leeps to her rescue and beats away the mean dog.</p><p>This child's named is Pico (i think) and she isn't actually a child..  She's a monster.  Her brother Puco quickly comes to the scene and tries to save Pico from you.  Both Puco and Pico are surprised that Parin can see them, as they are not visible to adults in the town.  Puco and Pico lead you to a hole in the town's wall where you are whisked away to the monster town.</p><p>The monster town is home to many playful and interesting monsters, but it's not too long until Puco is kidnapped by evil phantoms.  This is where the towns-monsters call on your for help.  In the center of the village is an ancient weapon that only a true hero could weild.  She/he who can pull it out of the ground, is its' rightful master.</p><p>Of course, it's no problem for you..  You pull out the weapon and huzzah!  The weapon is an ancient drill that has been known to slay the evil phantom menance in the past.</p><p>Anyways, You run out to save Puco, but it's all a diversion.  In your absense, the monster town is destroyed by the phantoms and evil mist covers the once beautiful monster land.</p><p>Even though, you've been playing for about 40 minutes, this is the point where the plot of the game really begins.  With the town in ruins, you travel back into the monster land and recover pieces of the shattered village and inspiration your monster friends to rebuild.</p><div class='title'><b>Looks</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of those playful kiddy adventure games that found a home on the Playstation back in the day.  Much like Megaman Legends, Tail Concerto and Brave Fencer Musashiden.  You play a cute little character, fighting monsters.. but all the enemies are very non-threatening and have brilliant colors and cute tones.  It's a Japanese kids game. ^_^</p><p>Also akin to those games, Gurumin is fully 3D with very simply textures and models..  It reminds me so much of a PS1 game because it looks just like a PS1 game, except the image quality on the PSP removes all those jagged edges and really smooths out everything.</p><p>I've been playing this on one of those new PSP Slim and Lites, and I've noticed a fair amount of ghosting with Parin's little red pigtail ribbons.  Whenever she moves quickly, her hair will jerk to the side and the ghosting is very apparent.  It doesn't really bother me though, and its only really noticable when she's on a dark background.</p><div class='title'><b>Role Playing Aspects</b></div><p>Anyways, Gurumin is an action RPG.  You have your weapons, your equipment and your HP.  You never really change weapons, but you can upgrade it.  Living in a mining town has its advantages..  just down the road you have your drill expert that can teach you new tricks with your drill...  He'll give 'em to you for free, but you'd much rather pay for them than owe favors.</p><p>Leveling is kinda funny in this game.  You have 3 power bars for your weapon and whenever you successful defeat an enemy, or break part of the environment, it'll start charging up your bar.  Once you power up a single bar, your weapon will gain a level and do more damage.  If you get hurt by an enemy, it'll decrease your power bar which can result in losing levels.</p><p>The only equipment I've found so far has been headgear.  Each piece of headgear has certain effects.  The store owner gives you goggles right off the bat, which help prevent water damage.  You can buy new pieces of equipment if you want, but you can also upgrade the equipment you own for increased effects.  These upgrades don't cost money, but do cost Junk.</p><p>Junk are broken pieces of weapons and armor you usually tear off of phantoms while you fight them.  Most phantom wear a funny hat, or carry a shield.  When you fight them, you'll eventually knock it off of them and you'll collect it.</p><p>So far, I haven't found a way to increase my max HP, but I'd guess they are items you can use to permanently increase your max health.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As an action RPG, you simple run around levels and beat the crap out of enemies.  The attacking system is really nice.  Sure, you can spam the attack button all you want, but you can buy new powerful moves to use against enemies too.  So far, I've purchase a spin attack and a ground smash attack.</p><p>There's actually a slight bit of strategy in using these attacks too.  When you're surounded by enemies, using the spin attack is actually more helpful than spamming the regular attack button, or jumping out of the way and attacking them one by one.  It's a useful attack.</p><p>You can also charge your attack, and coming drilling into battle rather than normal attacks.  Charging your drill is also very good for destroying chunks of the wall and pillars to find money and secret passage ways when in a dungeon.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallels</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of Drill Dozer, but they are completely different games.  Released on the Gameboy Advance, Drill Dozer preceeded Gurumin by 8 or 9 months and features similar concepts.</p><p>Parallel 1) You both play little girls using the power of a drill.  In Drill Dozer, Jill actually climbs into a drilling machine which kills enemies and destroys walls and pillars.  In Gurumin, Parin's drill is more of a spear.  The drill tip spear head is plunged into enemies.</p><p>Parallel 2) Both drills have a 3 part leveling system which is not permanent.  In Drill Dozer, you begin each stage at level 0.  Throughout the stage, you pick up gears which will allow you to charge your drill longer and present a greater attack.  In Gurumin, each successful kill increase your level all the way up to 3.  At each level, your drill is stronger, but you charge your attacks the same regardless of level.</p><p>I suppose Parallel 3) would be the charging of your shots are dependent on a 3 part leveling system where the higher the level the more powerful the charge shot.</p><p>But both games are of two different genres.  Gurumin is an action RPG, whereas Drill Dozer is a side-scroller.  I suppose both games are stage driven though and you unlock more stages as you continue into the game.  You can also visit previous stages you've beaten.</p><p>Drill Dozer is a fantastic game, by the way, and it'd definitely recommend it.  It's made by Game Freak after they finished Pokemon Emerald and before they began working on the next-generation of Pokemon games currenty out now.</p><div class='title'><b>Cute</b></div><p>Gurumin is a very lovable game.  You play a funny cute girl who is very rude to the elderly townspeople.  She also pokes fun at the cookie-cutter story too..  The game has some clever item descriptions too, like those Disgaea and Phantom Brave.</p><p>It's really been a joy to play so far, but a little on the easy side.  It's still the beginning though, so there's plenty of time to be challenging.</p><p>After 2 hours of the game, my verdict is quite positiive.  If you like offbeat action rpgs, I'd say definitely go for it.  Gamestop probably has it for slightly cheaper than $20 these days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/capcoms-gamer-day-announcements">Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, Capcom has their Gamer's Day out in London, England and with it several interesting announcements had occurred.  One of the biggest announcements was Street Fighter 4.. but that's not really what interested me so much.  Actually, the trailer for Streeet Fighter 4 looks pretty slick.. <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml">check it out.</a> They also officially announced Apollo Justice, which I'm estactic for, but there's some else that could be interesting.</p><p>Good 'ol <b>Lost Planet</b> we see its release on the Playstation 3.  This is fantastic news.  The Playstation 3 release will include all downloadable content seen on Xbox Live and the PC version of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Why is this fantastic news?</b></div><p>Well, to be honest Lost Planet is a piece of shit.  The gameplay is restrictive and gets in the way and the final boss is unbeatable even when you knock his life to 0..  <a href="/old/v7/lost-planet" title="/lost-planet">read all about it</a></p><p>Lost Planet coming to Playstation 3 is a gateway.  It means that Capcom is developing a Playstation 3 port of their Lost Planet engine, which was initially developed when making Dead Rising..  This engine was made with love from Keiji Inafune's team in the hopes of one day creating a next-gen Megaman adventure game to the tune of Megaman Legends 3.  That's why there's all those Megaman references in Dead Rising and Lost Planet.</p><p>Making a multi-platform version of their Lost Planet / Dead Rising engine should give them more leverage in pitching the idea of Megaman Legends 3 to the Capcom powers that be.  This also means there's a slight hope for a Playstation 3 Dead Rising port..  or at least Dead Rising 2 on both platforms... or whatever they have next on the engine hitting both platforms.</p><div class='title'><b>others</b></div><p>Capcom also announced a new Sci-fi IP titled Dark Void.. so I wonder if that's the next game for this engine.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sneak King Final Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sneak-king-final-thoughts">Sneak King Final Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On second hand though, Sneak King is so monotonous that it gets tiring really fast. I liked playing the first level in the saw mill because it was relatively easy, but the later levels have more challenge and the limitations of the gameplay get in your way of completing your missions</p><div class='title'><b>Short-comings</b></div><p>After playing the same level of Sneak King over and over, you'll begin to notice that all the people in the level aren't randomly generated. Everyone is on a specific track starting in a specific spot whenever you load a mission. Irregardless of where you are in the level, everyone else will begin in the same spot, and usually they'll be hungry at the exact same times.</p><p>Even though this is incredibly lazy programming, it makes the game predictable. You know exact where you have to be at a specific time, and if you screw it up, then do it again. You don't need to take into account random events as you would in real life. This really brings the feeling of the game into a game-like atmosphere and you can improve on your score because of this.</p><p>This is fine for the first level, where people are predictably hungry when they near hiding places, but the second level flips the paradigm upside down. Hardly anyone in this level travels near a hiding place, and when they do, they're either not hungry or start too close to the hiding place for you to hide without them seeing you.</p><p>They cover for this by making nearly all missions in the second level Stealth based, rather than Surprise based. But those few that are hiding are nearly impossible to get an A ranking on. I'm not even sure if it's possible to do so. :/</p><p>I just made it to the third level last night, and there's a night and day difference between that and the previous level. You have a much more open space like at the saw mill, but you have a ton of people that are rarely hungry. Getting around is tough.</p><div class='title'><b>Not enough variety</b></div><p>Like I mentioned in the previous post, nearly all missions are the exact same. You've got a certain number of BK items to give out to people, and you either do it as fast as possible, or with the highest score possible. Sometimes they'll give you restrictions like only give to females, or don't perform a flourish.. Annoying things that prevent you from enjoying the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnt out</b></div><p>After playing this game nearly all Sunday, and then another hour on Monday, I don't think i'll be able to play this game again. 7 hours is all the enjoyment I've gotten out of it, and the only thing that really keeps me going is unlocking more achievements. I'm pretty close to unlocking a few more. I've completed around 37 out of 80 missions in the game. I don't think anyone has played this game that far. Gage said he played it for about 10 minutes and got bored.</p><div class='title'><b>Rate this game</b></div><p>So how do you really rate this game? It's horrible programmed.. you can't invert neither axis, and the camera angles screw you on occasions.. but.. it's only $4. You get what you pay for. $4 is cheaper than nearly all Xbox Live games... and it really shows.</p><p>It's because of that $4 price tag that I definitely recommend the game, but you probably won't get much play out of it. You'll find the same things hilarious like I did, but then get absolutely bored with nothing else to do in the game.</p><p>(and) This is supposed to be the better of the 3 Burger King games.. I wonder if the other ones are actually that bad. It difficult to screw up a racing game, but bumper cars? That sounds pretty boring..</p><div class='title'><b>Why does this work?</b></div><p>Something else that kinda puzzles me is "Why does this game work?". Why is the King such a successful mascot that they can make a crappy cheap game on the 360 and have it rise to one of the best selling 360 games of last Christmas season? Let's face facts.. you're only playing this game because of The King.</p><p>Burger King will never reach sales equal to McDonalds, but their marketing plans are great. 2006 was one of their busiest years for marketing. They had 4 marketing campaigns going on at the same too, which was somewhat confusing. They Cock Rock pushing those Chicken Fries, The King doing his normal thing, those Office workers pushing the dollar menu, and that one MAN commercial pushing the steak sandwich... They were pulling out all the stops.</p><p>These days, I haven't really seen any burger king commercials. I occasionally see a crappy McDonalds commercial, and those disgusting Hardees commercials have also made waves on my TV.. I wonder what BK is up to.. Perhaps they're biding their time until the Superbowl again.</p><p>Anyways, The King hits the mark at the perfect amount of goofy and bizarre that drives sales in the 18 to 35 demographic, i guess. Superimposing him into football plays only drives the point home further.</p><div class='title'><b>Hope</b></div><p>Hopefully Burger King will do some more Xbox related games or downloads in the future. I think if they went back and refined Sneak King, it could be a great game... but 80 missions of exactly the same thing is overkill.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 - Sneak King " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-sneak-king">Xbox 360 - Sneak King </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today was one of those rare days where I didn't really have anything to occupy my time.  Usually my Sundays are spent coming back to Madison from wherever I stayed the night before, but today I got back home around 1pm and had the whole day in front of me.  I finally finished up Halo 3, but that only took an hour or two.</p><p>I didn't want to start an involved game since Castlevania comes out in a week..  I was thinking about playing some more Oblivion, but it felt like a waste of time..  But then on the shelf behind me, I saw my vice.  A brilliant gem on the 360 that I was so excited for last year.  I had missed my chance to play it because I was living over seas, but my little brother picked me up a copy..</p><p>Sneak King..  One of three Burger King games released for the Xbox and Xbox 360 last christmas season.  In fact, It was one of the top sellers for the Xbox 360, since it was yours for the low low price of $3.99 with purchase of value meal.  How could you honestly beat that?  That's cheaper than buying a magazine about the 360.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day with my pal, the King and it was great!</p><div class='title'><b>The premise</b></div><p>Sneak King is probably the most market driven of the 3 Xbox Burger King games.  In Sneak King, you play as the king, and must deliver delicious Burger King food items to the hunger people of various environments.  You are judged on 5 things that will multiply your score:  Sneak/Surpise, Hunger, Flourish, Range, Chain.</p><p><em>Sneak/Surpise</em><br/>This is the initial point total of your presentation.  You can simply sneak behind the citizen, but you'll find yourself 5 times the amount of points if you surprise them!  To surprise them, you hide in part of the environment and when they walk by..  you jump out in front of them with a tasty BK treat!</p><p><em>Hunger</em><br/>Of course, you can't give anyone food..  they have to want it.  The king has special mind reading powers that allows him to see how hungry someone is.  When they are at their hungriest.. that is the best time to strike!</p><p><em>Flourish</em><br/>Giving food to someone unsuspecting is great, but you really need to let them have it.  When you pounce on someone you're given a guage much like in a golf game.  Get that thing to full and you'll present the food to them in such a way, they'll be absolutely dazzled.</p><p><em>Range</em><br/>The closer you are to your target, the bigger the surpise!</p><p><em>Chain</em><br/>This is really how you build up your points..  Whenever the King is spotted it throws off his game and he must start again.  The chain is how many chained sneaks you can perform without getting caught.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>Using the gameplay described above, you are presented with several missions in each area.  Missions are generally all the same except with different time restraints, score restraints, and sneak restraints.  All in all, you have 4 different environments with 20 missions included in each.  That's a lot of missions.  It probably took me about 4 or 5 hours to full complete the first area before heading onto the next.</p><p>That first area was sort of split up into 3 sections though, so it wasn't too monotenous, but you're still doing the same thing over and over again.  The different environments provide a change of pace, though.</p><p>The first environment is the saw mill.  You have hungry lumberjacks and workers looking for a quite BK break in the middle of their daunting day.  The second environment is the cul de sack.  The dead end of a suburban street where neighbors are walking around greeting each other and looking for a quite BK break of their daily lives.</p><p>The first environment provided you will ample room and plenty of places to hide and pounce on the hungry inhabitants..  The second environment is much more dense..  They focus on sneaking, rather than surprising.  Even though, you should always hide yourself from the public, they really emphasis that in the second chapter.</p><div class='title'><b>Progress</b></div><p>I just reached halfway through the second world, so I've still got a ways to go if I wish to achievement whore the game.  Sneak King is hilarious and full of flaws..  Quite possibly one of the best B-games on the 360 to date, next to Earth Defense Force..  Definitely check it out if you can find a copy.  It's a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3">Halo 3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, i finally finished up with Halo 3.  I beat it on Heroic (the true difficulty setting), and proceeded to get my ass kicked in Legendary.  I found all the skulls and accessed all the terminals, so aside from a few other achievements online, I think I'm probably at my limit for the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>In order to truly appreciate Halo 3, you should really play through Heroic.  Normal is just way too easy to be taken seriously.  In Heroic, you get a true sense of the enemies actually being strategic when defending or attacking.  The brutes will always send in a little grunt to smoke you out.  They'll chuck grenades down the hall at you and try to cut off escape routes.</p><p>In Normal, you can easily mow down any enemies that stand in your way..  It's really no challenge.  Lately it seems like Normal difficult is the new Easy difficult.  When a casual gamer picks up a game, he doesn't want to play on easy just because he sucks..  He wants Normal just like the big boys.  Developers have been continually dumbing down difficulty levels to the point where the true experience is Hard mode.  The same was with Metroid Prime 3.  Games are getting too easy.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. Legendary difficulty is simply balls out difficult.  I gave up after consistently dying during the first few skirmishes in the jungle.  Penny Arcade was SPOT ON when they said Legendary on Halo 3 is a chore.  There were a few spots in Heroic that were challenging and took me a while, but they weren't difficult.  Heroic was that bowl of porrage that was just the right temperature.  Normal is too cold, and Legendary is too hot.</p><div class='title'><b>Environments</b></div><p>Isn't it rather strange that all the "alien" worlds look exactly like Earth?  True, when you're on a halo you can see the ring continue up into the atmosphere and when you're on the ark, you can see the rims in the distance..  But the actual environments you walk on...  there's nothing alien about them at all.  Why does the ark look exactly like someplace on earth?  Why can't their be bizzare plant-life?  Why don't we ever see indigenous animal life too?</p><p>Metroid Prime 3 has some imaginative places to explore..  Why does something as sacrade as the Ark and a Halo ring look normal?  Maybe that's something I'm missing in the story..</p><p>Also, there really wasn't any epic battle fought on earth the way it was fought in Halo 2.  The second level of Halo 2 had you fighting your way to one of earth's major cities.  In the distance, you could actually see the city and the havoc taking place.  As you fought your way toward it, it would grow on the horizon until you eventually arrived inside that city you had seen from the beginning of the battle.  Then you waged war on the streets and in alleyways.</p><p>In Halo 3, there's nothing like that at all.  The locations you fight on Earth, look like burnt out Army bases and bunkers.  You never fight in a true residential area..  and because of that you never get that emotion attachment to your surrounding to actually feel like Earth is actually in peril.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. The environments are varied throughout the game, so it's not the same level over and over again.  There's the jungle, an underground bunker, a desert base, base of a mountain, snowy hills, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Honestly, I don't think the story of Halo 3 is all that bad.  It's like a fun action movie where you play the unbeatable action hero.  Unfortunately, they really didn't do much with the backstory of the first two games.  I guess Bungie was assuming that if you're playing Halo 3, then you probably played through Halo 1 and 2 and remember the story verbatum.</p><p>Well, even though I have played through Halo 1 and 2, that was so long ago, I hardly even remember it.  I remember a little bit of Halo 2's cop out ending, but I really have no idea what the convenant actually is, nor the real importance of the Halo rings, nor most other stuff.</p><p>Apparently, the extra disc in the limited edition has all the cutscenes from Halo 1 and 2 remastered and cut together for people to catch up on the story..  So, I should really check that out.  I would REALLY like it if Bungie (or whomever these days) would remake the campaign missions Halo 1 and 2 using the Halo 3 engine.  I would love to go through them again and not have to put up with dated graphics and no achievements.  I suppose if Microsoft did that, each set of campaign missions would be $30 :/</p><p>Anyways, I thought the ending for the Halo series worked pretty well.  It put a lid on Halo..  hopefully when the do make a Halo 4, it'll be called something more appropriate.</p><div class='title'><b>More?</b></div><p>What more is there to say about Halo really?  I'm horribly at multiplayer and I really was playing it more for the story.  Though now that 2 of my close friends picked up 360s with Halo 3, I might be online a little more messing around with forge or multiplayer..  but I think I've hit my limit for regular multiplayer.  I really don't get that much enjoyment out of running around killing a bunch of people I don't really know to ascend the ranks and fight people that I can't really compete against.  Plus, there's other games to play ^_^</p><p>Halo 3 is a great social game, though.. so if you got a couple friends with a copy, getting yourself a copy isn't such a bad idea.  There's more than just Slayer matches.</p><p>I guess that's really all I have to say about Halo 3.  :shrugs</p><p><em>Related Posts</em><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-biting-the-bullet" title="/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the bullet</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-midnight-release" title="/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-initial-impressions" title="/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset" title="/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset">Halo 3 Wireless Headset</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Event Party" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-adobe-max-event-party">Adobe Max Event Party</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Fully catered with food and beer!  The doors opened up around 6:30 or 7:00pm.</p><p>Inside the doors, you were escorted through a tunnel of light.  On the other side, you emerged within the 80s</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" /></p><p>You were inside of a massive hall that was sectioned into 3 separated eras of our past: the 80s, 90s and 00s.  In the air were the annoying sounds of the 80s.  In the middle of the hall, was a curtain that projected Ferris Beuler, and Back to the Future.  There were 8 flat panel screens setup playing Super Mario Brothers, Elevator Action, and several other Wii Virtual Console Titles.</p><p>Several other trinkets were placed all over the place too.  In the corner, they setup a retro arcade with Pacman, Tetris, Centipede, and Air Hockey.  You could also find a Delorion, Karaoke, Picture Booths and a couple other weird 80s things.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" /></p><p>There were plenty of things to eat as well.  You had your choice between hot dogs and macaroni & cheese.</p><p>The flow of the room forced you to go counter-clockwise, which brought you into the 90s.  That's pretty backward, actually.  If they had you move clockwise as the decade progressed, it would've made more sense.</p><p>In the 90s, the curtain displayed Britney spears, and off to the side were BMX bikers doing a bunch of tricks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" /></p><p>Caterers offered pizza and mini-burgers.  More Wii were setup as well, which offered Super Nintendo and Genesis titles for play.</p><p>Continuing along brought you into today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" /></p><p>Immediately you were brought into the Texas Hold 'em den, where it was completely packed.  All the tables were full with adobe maxers betting fake cash against each other.  More flat panel TVs were setup, this time with Xbox 360s playing lanned Halo 3.  They also had a Segway obstacle course!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" /></p><p>For food, they offered mostly Asian buffet foods.</p><p>No matter which decade you were in, all the beers table offered the same variety, so, thank god, you didn't have to go searching for what you wanted.  I think it would've been different to pull off beers from the past two decades though, so maybe it was more of a limitation than a convenience.</p><p>Anyways, after grabbing a couple beers and some tasty food, I played some Halo 3 for a little while.  Unlike playing Halo online, most of the convention goers weren't die-hard fans, so I was actually able to hold my own for the majority of the time.</p><p>After a game or two, my co-workers caught up with me, so I joined in some more group oriented activities.  We played some air hockey, Super Mario, took some pictures in the photo booth, went back to Halo.  It was a great time, and the beer kept flowing ^_^</p><p>They eventually began kicking people out of the place, so the good times came to an end.  Not for too long though..  once we returned to our hotel, we parked ourselves in the hotel lobby's bar and continued the night.</p><div class='title'><b>Day Two in general</b></div><p>Sooo....  this is the main reason, why all these blog entries took so long to get up on the internet.  Day Two was completely jam-packed full of events from start to finish that I really didn't have a chance to start writing anything until later.</p><p>Overall, it was a great day, full of great sessions and great fun with great people.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - AdverGaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-advergaming">Adobe Max - AdverGaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>AdverGaming was all about how interactive gaming has spilled into online advertising and how you can catch the new wave. This session covers design and technical challenges inherent to making games for advertising campaigns. This discussion was lead by Sam Rivello, who is the director of Multimedia Development at NeoPets inc. He has designed over 400 flash and shockwave games developed for a youth oriented audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Casual Gaming</b></div><p>Rivello first stating what type of games are advergames. They are 100% casual games that require no long term commitment or special skills from the User. Casual games are meant for a mass audience and continue very few, and simple rules in order to play. Your game should lie within the 5-10 minute attention span of your audience.</p><p>Like all advertising, it should grab the User and keep them playing as long as possible, which means don't push details and information on the user. When a user thinks fun, they don't think about reading or something informational. Gaming is an immersive experience, so capture that.</p><div class='title'><b>Making an advergame</b></div><p>Rivello had 4 things that make an advergame an advergame.</p><p><i>Objective</i><br/>The main objective is to generate buzz and/or influence a purchase. An advergame is really an advertisement, so if you don't successful advertise your product, you have failed at making a successful advergame.</p><p><i>Target Audience</i><br/>The target audience of an advergame are teens between the ages of 12 and 17, so be sure to create your game for that audience. Teens are very active, so if your game is boring, then you're done. Capture the User and compel them to continue with your game.</p><p><i>Success Metrics</i></p><p><i>Timing</i><br/>An advergame is always timely and will always have strict deadlines that are along-side the product you're advertising. Being late with your game is unacceptable. Contrary to that, the lifespan of an advergame is incredibly short. Most of these games stay in the market between 1 and 6 months, so budget your time accordingly. Learn best practices and build an engine that you can switch out new characters and products with easily.</p><div class='title'><b>Proposal</b></div><p>Next, how do you sneak the idea of an advergame into your advertising proposal?</p><p>This was the part of the presentation where I simple nodded off.. This really didn't apply to me at all and it sounded a lot like a technical writing lecture than anything development related. Of course, designers and developers have to write, but this isn't helpful to me at the moment one bit.</p><p>I'm sure it's great information for those Flash developers that are trying to pull their animations into games, but I'm not a flash developer. I really don't care.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>and unfortunately, that's how this whole session ended for me. I was hoping to get inspired or learn some insight, but I gained neither from this presentation. I should have taken something more applicable and useful. Oh well.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Best Practices for Great Experiences" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-best-practices-for-great-web-experiences">Adobe Max - Best Practices for Great Experiences</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This was one of the premiere sessions hosted by the experience design, XD, team at Adobe, originally formed at Macromedia.  Andrew Lin lead this session and was a co-founder of this group.  "<em>As senior lead of XD, Lin drives the experience vision of next-generation of Creative Suite, namely Photoshop and Illustrator.  Working with engineering and product management teams, he is defining the Adobe Experience Model, a content-first interface approach for Adobe's desktop applications,</em>" says the Adobe Max website.</p><p>This session was all about what worked well for the XD team, and useful tips on how to improve the workflow of your own development team.</p><div class='title'><b>Team</b></div><p>After a bit of introductions, Lin went into what makes their team work and had 4 solid concepts they always think about for their staff.</p><p><em>Emphasis on making</em><br/>One of their main goals is to create great products, so they want their staff to have that natural inhibition to create something.</p><p><em>Generalists over specialists</em><br/>Their staff must have the overall vision of what they wish to achieve and not be bogged down by the details.  In order to reach the general audience, you must think in general terms.</p><p><em>Promote Trust and Freedom</em><br/>Innovation doesn't come by following orders, or coloring in the lines.  Real innovation comes from outside the box, and learning to trust your staff by giving them the freedom to go wild on a project is key in building an amazing product.</p><p><em>Have fun</em><br/>One of the biggest parts of their community is to have fun people to work with.  Being in a warm, playful environment is key to having a productive cohesive environment.  When choosing new members of the team, a candidate's personality outweighs their talent.</p><div class='title'><b>Process</b></div><p>Now that you've met the team, Lin went on to describe how they worked together.  Communication is crucial.  Your team needs to know what's going on with the project, and need to know they can get answers from anyone.  Having an open office without secrets and open communication promotes cohesion between everything you're working on.</p><p>Having an overall process is not that important.  Following a rigid structure only promotes stress and doesn't give your staff the flexibility and freedom to do what they want.  When you are free to be absorbed in your work, you'll get the best results ^_^</p><p>But that doesn't mean everyone can just screw around.  You must be very goal-oriented and always have focus on the end goal of your project.  With everyone working within your goals, your end user's goals will easily be met.</p><p>With these three concepts in mind, Lin gave us 5 rules for promoting a great working atmosphere.</p><p>1. <em>Simplify the problem</em>.  Never be too focused on one task that you lose sight of your real goal.  Learn to generalize and shrink the scope of your problem into steps.  Make it easy. ^_^</p><p>2. <em>Trust your instincts</em>.  Real experience cannot be read or taught, it is things you've found throughout the years, and with that knowledge you've surely encountered similar problems in the past.  If you think you're onto something, go with it.</p><p>3. <em>Share everything</em>.  The more other people know about your problem, the more knowledge you bring into the situation.  Having more eyes on a problem can find that solution you've been looking for.  Also, sharing your solutions with everybody will increase their knowledge on your overall project.</p><p>4. <em>Fail fast (to succeed sooner)</em>.  Always good advice.  If you're doing something wrong, it's best to know about it as soon as possible so you can correct the problem as soon as possible.</p><p>5. <em>We are all peers before the object</em>.  No one owns the project.  You are part of a team and as part of a team it is your responsibility to contribute to the project.  It's all about team work. ^_^</p><p>Before he finished up his tips, he stressed the importance of prototyping, prototyping, prototyping.  Always have a something to show your engineers and your customers to get the most amount of feedback possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Principles</b></div><p>This is the third component of their team:  How do they design.  Lin had 4 well organized principles they always keep in mind when designing their products.</p><p><em>What's your point?</em><br/>Having a <b>clear design objective</b> when beginning your project.  Know where you are going with it and what you hope to achieve by the end of your process.  Complete your <b>main tasks first</b>, before adding on any features.  That also goes along with <b>keeping it simple</b>.  Don't add a lot of unnecessary crap to your design.  (and) <b>Focus and emphasize</b> your main goals of your design.</p><p><em>Content is King</em><br/>Your design should be emphasize on your client's needs.  <b>Content before Chrome</b>.  <b>Provide flexibility</b> for the User to achieve their own goals with the product, while still adhering to the goals of your client.  Also, <b>enable direct manipulation</b>.. let the user do what they want.</p><p><em>Create an experience, not an interface</em><br/><b>Make it personal</b> for the user to give them a unique experience that they can take with them after using your product.  You've heard the expression 'less is more', but in practice <b>'just enough is more'</b>.  Adding in some key extras can put your design into excellence.  And be sure to <b>respond to your user</b>, rather than dictate.  Don't boss the user around, but guide them to their goals.</p><p><em>Choreograph sequence and flow</em><br/><b>Design as a whole</b>.  Be consist throughout your design and be sure to leave a trail for the User to follow.  <b>Establish a hierarchy</b> to let the user know the organization of your product.</p><p>(yeah, i kinda jammed everything together into paragraphs..)</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Like all presentations at this conference, Lin was running out of time so he tried to squish everything in as fast as possible toward the end (much like this blog post).</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, his concepts were quite sound and very helpful to everyone that attended.  It was boring as hell though, as Lin's persona really didn't seem to carry in his speech.  From the pictures he showed and practices he talked about, it sounded like it'd be a blast to work there, but a lot of his talk did seem to drag on.</p><p>It may have dragged on a bit because he was preaching to the choir on most of these points.  I found it rather amazing that nearly everything he recommended other teams to do, we had already done these things in my own development team at Widen.  As he went from point to point, I was mentally checking off things in my head, "yep, we do that..  yep, we do that, too"</p><p>Having a very cohesive team promotes a great environment that you can accomplish many goals both personal, professional, and for the company as well.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - What Makes Interfaces feel Intuitive?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-what-makes-an-interface-feel-intuitive">Adobe Max - What Makes Interfaces feel Intuitive?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Jared Spool is one of the most knowledgable people on the subject of User Interface.  According to the adobe max website, he's been working in the field of usability and design since 1978, before the term "usability" was ever associated with computers.  In 1988, Spool founded the <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">User Interface Engineering</a>, a firm that leads the world in research, training and consulting for website and product usability.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">uie.com</a>.</p><p>Spool began his presentation with a simple example.  He presented that crowd with a simple request form for some hotel.  The form was quite standard, but two fields on this form were optional.  The company marked these with an asterisk with a comment above stating that the asterisk marked fields were optional.</p><p>However, Users that visited the site would have a very difficult time filling out this form.  Why did they have difficulty?  Because in our everyday visits to filling out forms, the asterisk implies 'mandatory', not 'optional'.  Nearly every registration or information form we fill out on the internet has this norm.  It was unintuitive to do it any other way.</p><p>Spool asks the crowd, "Who decided what an asterisk meant?  When did it become 'unintuitive' to do it differently?"  Most things in our life are done a very specific way and have been for some day, but who decided this?  This was Spool's opening statement, and the lecture to come would help to answer this.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>As a disclaimer, Spool begins setting straight a little bit of terminology.  The term 'design' is not something that can be intuitive.  Designs don't intuit anything, people do.  So calling a design "intuitive" is a shortcut.  He just wanted to get that out there, so during the rest of his lecture he could refer to the intuitiveness of a design, without causing confusion.</p><p>So, when is a design intuitive?  Well, we defintely know when a design is unintuitive.  This happens when we look at something and have no idea what to do.  Tasks take too long, and we grow increasingly frustrated with it.  We feel its the design's fault for our shortcomings.</p><div class='title'><b>The User</b></div><p>Being intuitive means beings personal.  To make a design we need to know our user.  What does the User currently know when coming into our design?  What previous experience does the User have with this kind of process?  Here's a little graph of the User's knowledge:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" /></p><p>The current knowledge is what the user already knows when coming into your design, and the target knowledge is what they need to know in order to fully understand your product.  In between these two points is the knowledge..  this is the leg-work you must provide your User to understand your system.  This is where the design happens.</p><div class='title'><b>Intuitive Design</b></div><p>Intuitive design is evolutionary.  Designer's first build the technology.  Over time more features are added to help the User and make things easier.  Changes in the design are made over time as well, which reduce complexity.  Throughout time as you tweak and perfect your design, it will become more and more intuitive to the User and you'll bring that target knowledge closer to the User's current knowledge.</p><p>So, when is design intuitive?  It's when one of two things are achieved.  Either (1) the current knowledge of your User is equal to the target knowledge required for your product.  In this case, the User already knows exactly what to do.  Or (2) the knowledge gap is very small.  The user can figure out the design of your product that they don't even know that they're learning.</p><div class='title'><b>Information Gathering</b></div><p>Spool gave us a couple common practices in getting to know your user better and understanding what they know.</p><p><em>Field Studies</em><br/>Surveying your Users can give you a good estimate on your audience's current knowledge.</p><p><em>Usability Studies</em><br/>Setting up focus groups and test sessions can help you identify your knowledge gap and give you good pointers on how you can reduce it early on.</p><p><em>Personas</em><br/>Identifying who your User is can put them in a familiar atmosphere when using your product.</p><p><em>Patterns</em><br/>Studying your user's patterns and current work flows will help you communicate knowledge to the user and shrink the knowledge gap.</p><div class='title'><b>Making things intuitive</b></div><p>Making things more intuitive is all about reducing the target knowledge and placing clues in your interface to steadilly increase your User's current knowledge.  One example he gave was to use error messages that actually help your user identify the problem!</p><p>Another example is the magic of wizards.  A wizard is a piece of your program that guides your user.  When done right, wizards instantly reduce the target knowledge of your product.  It supplements knowledge with technology, but never actually teaches the User.</p><p>When using a wizard, the target knowledge of the wizard must lie within the knowledge gap of your program.  Other wise, the User would be much better off without it.</p><p>Also think about reducing some of your workflow.  Figure out what is really necessary in your design and what isn't.  If you have a bunch of unneccesary features or steps, get rid of them.  Makes things as simple for the user as possible.  Make sure your program matches the user's goals.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Spool began to run out of time and was hurried up towards the end but he left us with some main points he wanted us to take away.</p><p>Intuitive is personal.<br/>Intuitive happens when the knowledge gap is minimized.<br/>and just because you know how to work your program, doesn't mean the user does.</p><p>Always remember that last one.  You've built this program, you've designed and know all about it.  Everything in the program is obvious to you, so don't think that it's completely obvious to the average user.  You current knowledge of your program is far beyond the current knowledge of your user.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Out of the conference, this session belongs in my top 3 favorite moments from Adobe Max.  Not only was this session full of rich information, but Jared Spool is a hilarious guy.  It's rather interesting that his well placed humor throughout the lecture was really what engaged the audience into all the information he presented, much like well placed hints and tool tips within your program will engage your user.</p><p>You couldn't help but learn, and I felt I left this session learning quite a bit.  Definitely look for this guy at any designer or developer conference you should find yourself at.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day 2 Keynote by Kevin Lynch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">Adobe Max Day 2 Keynote by Kevin Lynch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After the first session of day two, everyone came back to the General Session room for a the second half of Adobe's keynote to the attendees. This was more of the previous day's self serving adobe update for everyone. The first day's keynote was about what we've done with Adobe, and today was about what Adobe is doing for us.</p><div class='title'><b>Bruce Chizen speaks</b></div><p>As a huge surprise, current CEO of Adobe, Bruce Chizen, took the stage and addressed the crowd. He began to talk about how hard is to be mister big bad CEO of a large company. Yeah.. poor him and his million dollar salary. But his speech ended on a good note. The whole slogan of Adobe Max is to Connect, Discover and Inspire. He thought it was great to see so many people inspired by the works of others and to connect with each and spread the word of Adobe.</p><p>Chizen explained that even though their job was to Inspire, it is truly us.. the designers and developers that inspire Adobe to make these products in the first place. Adobe is our instrument to create, and in turn, we are their instrument to create.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest..</b></div><p>The rest of the speech talked about Servers, Services and Tools of current Adobe. The only service that was truly amazing was Scene 7. This is a Image Server that converts images in realtime. You host an image on this server, and you can send it any number of parameters that will change the image on the fly. Extremely helpful for generating previews and being able to zoom in on online photos.</p><p>The other interesting thing in the rest of the speech was a new tool called <b>Thermo</b>. Thermo is a new Adobe program that will generate a running Flex application from importing a Photoshop document.</p><p>In this day and age, nearly all websites are mocked up in Photoshop. Once the design is done, you begin coding this thing in HTML and CSS to make it move and work the way you'd like. Thermo cuts out this step by creating the page for you. Simply import that Photoshop document and the page is creating. Of course, you'll need to do a little bit of editing to make things work.</p><p>Textbox? If you've mocked up a text box on your page, right click your input box and sample text and click on 'convert to textbox'. BAM, you've got a textbox that's completely operational and retains the text information from the sample text.</p><p>Next up was a List View complete with scroll bar and sample data. He had one of these all mocked up on his page, but with a simple right click with the sample images selected.. BAM, you've got a list of objects. You can adjust the margins of these images, and use a time-line to create roll over effects. Pretty snazzy! All using the UI.</p><p>Next up was the scroll bar. He had one of those mocked up underneath these images. With more right clicking on those components, BAM.. you've got a scroll bar. You have to specify which object is the scroll bar, the arrows, and the container though. But wait.. how does the scroll bar know which data it's looking at? Simply move a little handle over to the list and BAM. The scrollbar now works with the list!</p><p>In 20 minutes, you've already mocked up all the basic functionality of the website with actual Flex code behind it. You can easily deploy this thing for client, no problem..</p><p>Well, i'm sure you've already seen the problem with this.. The code generated by this program has got to be the most god awful, unmaintainable code in existence. Do you remember when Dreamweaver first came out? All the CSS was inline and it did not tear down any tags it created. A coder would shoot himself before ever trying to make a change on that pile of shit.</p><p>Way to go Thermo! Let's usher in a new age of horrible web code that will create more problems than it solves.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>That was about all I got out of that session. Scene 7 is bad ass, Thermo is ass bad. Of course, all the designers shit their pants when they did anything with Thermo. The gasps in the audience were really disheartening..</p><p>It reminds me of a quote said by Ted Neward of Java fame.. "You should always under stand one level of abstraction below of where you are working" Meaning, if you design a webpage, you better be damn sure you know HTML and CSS. If you develop JavaScript, you better be damn sure you know about DOM objects and Browser differences. If you don't know the abstract you're building on top of, then you have no right to develop on it.</p><p>So, if you're using Thermo and you don't know Flex.. don't even touch the thing. Learn Flex concepts and some syntax, and then begin developing your UI in Thermo. You'll probably see just how horrible a program it is and thank yourself in the end.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/59">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/57">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
