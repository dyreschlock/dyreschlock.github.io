| June 2, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I made my second attempt to reach Kiyomi Morimo <span class='ja'>清見森茂</span> by myself.  It's not too difficult to locate using Google Maps.  If you search for the neighborhood, Maps will give you a delightful outline: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d" title="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d">here</a>.  Looking on the map, there's only two ways to get to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>: come from the east, or come from the south.  My first attempt was coming from the east in which I ran into possible trouble.  Today's attempt was coming from the South, and going through the village of Shokawa <span class='ja'>荘川</span>.</p><p>If you follow the highway's frontage road south from the Hida Kiyomi entrance, about 15 minutes later, you'll come across a small farming neighborhood that has a road leading into the wilderness.  This road continues to follow a stream as it approaches Miboro Lake <span class='ja'>御母衣湖</span>,  Actually, right as that streams connects with the lake, you've arrived in the very southern tip of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.</p><p>Today, I drove to this neighborhood, and took the road into the forest.  After 10 minutes of driving, the pavement ends and turns into a rocky "dirt" road.  Still traversable, but at a much slower rate.  </p><p>As I continued through the forest, I actually came across some kind of neighborhood.  A house on stilts stood near this turn-off.  Looking at the map (36.081985, 137.002227), the road trails off but rejoined the main road not that much further, so it seemed like a "great" idea.  So, I decided to drive through this neighborhood.</p><p>The roads were actually paved, but were also totally covered by dried leafs, pine needles, some fallen branches, some fallen rocks, and some fallen trees.  Several times, I exited my car to clear the road for my car.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" /></p><p>I found 4 houses packed within this neighborhood.  Each house was on stilts, built in the middle of the forest.  There were no cars around, so I couldn't tell if anyone actually lived in them.  I would guess not.  At least not anyone of our society.  Bums or squatters could have been inside, but there's no way they could live without assistance from the outside world.  There were no gardens, or any livelihood at all.  Just an old house.</p><p>I did not pry.</p><p>However, Google Maps lied, and the roads that were certain to bring me back to the main road did not exist.  I turned my car around, and went back the way I came.</p><p>With that done, I continued on my way to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, and met my first obstruction: a big red gate.  The gates were at this point: 36.101633, 137.001209.  From the main road, these gates were about 23 minutes in.  Some other cars were already parked there, and an ashed fire pit was next to the white van.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" /></p><p>Past the gate was something I was very curious about.  On Google Maps, at point: 36.114263, 136.997079, the road is cut off as it hits a connecting stream.  On the other side of the stream, Maps marks a "walking only" road, which continues onward to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.  There's gotta be a bridge there, I thought.  Or some easy way to get across.</p><p>However, if the bridge was out, and I could walk across, Google Maps says it's about a 12 kilometer walk to where I considered a downtown area of Morimo.  Maps says that's a 2 hr 42 min hike, one way.  From my current position, I'm walking anyway.  But now there's an addition 2 kilometers to this possible bridge, which will add another 20-25 minutes.</p><p>Even though I needed to walk, I was still curious about the bridge, and walking that distance doesn't bother me.  So, I parked my car, grabbed my camera, ID, and water bottle, moved around the gate, and continued to walk down the road.  After 27 minutes, I reached that point on the map (36.114263, 136.997079), and HOLY SHIT!  The bridge actually exists!  Ha ha ha, I knew it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" /></p><p>But now I had a decision to make.  It's about 3:40pm.  I figured I could cover the 12k in about 2 hours at most, since it's a little more than half a half marathon length (23.1km).  That would get me back to my car around 8pm, I think, which is past sunset, and an absolutely bad idea.</p><p>I dunno… I couldn't simply stop, though.  So, I stupidly decided to continue.  I'll give myself until 5pm, then turn around.  Well, I didn't even last until 4pm when I came across an immovable barrier at point (36.119619, 136.988925), and immediately turned around.</p><p>As I turned the corner at that point, there was <b>a brown bear</b> in the middle of the road.</p><p>When I saw it, I thought it was a giant hyena, or some kind of wild dog.  It was big, though.  I'd say it was as big as I am.  It was facing directly at me, and it clearly and immediately saw me the instant I saw it.  My footsteps were making enough noise that it probably heard me coming.  I immediately recognized this situation as DANGER.  Without even thinking, I did a 180, and walked back the direction I came.  This all happened within a second.  The creature came into view, my brain said NOPE, and I am now walking back to my car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" /></p><p>I walked with the same attitude I had before seeing it to make it think I wasn't afraid or something.  And I was surveying the ground for anything I could use as a possible weapon if thing started stalking after me.  Also, I was still trying to figure out what I had just seen, and the likelihood of whether or not it would come after me, and if I were actually capable of defending myself.  Which was doubtful.  If that thing started chasing and attacking me, I'd be beaten down pretty quickly.  </p><p>And then I started thinking of that girl who was attacked by a bear.  And while the bear was eating her alive, she called her mom crying and panically explained the situation as it happened.  This one: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html">Daily Mail… sorry :(</a></p><p>After a few minutes of walking, and looking over my shoulder every couple of seconds, I figured it was far enough away, and that I could start running now.  I checked the time as well, so I could pinpoint this location later.  It was 3:56pm.</p><p>I made it back to Google's invisible bridge at 4:07pm.  Still no <b>bear</b> behind me.  And I made it back to my car at 4:28pm.  Still no bear.  Safe!</p><p>Again, I thought it was some kind of dog or hyena or something.  It had a long face, and body more like a dog or hyena.  Not a bear.  Or at least, the "bear" body image that always comes to mind.  Bears always seem so puffy.</p><p>Once at home, I started searching on Google to figure out what I had seen.  Apparently, Japanese wolves are extinct, and any wild dogs are no longer than 100cm (or 1 yard).  I searched for other wildlife in central Japan, and didn't find anything that fit the description in my head.  I searched for Japanese bears, and the following image is similar to the type of animal I saw:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" /></p><p>(This image was taken from <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387" title="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387">digitaljournal.com</a>)</p><p>It's pretty close.  It's hard to trust my memory since I only saw the thing for an instant, and even though I turned around, my brain was constantly fixated on that brief visual encounter.  Any details could be slightly skewed.  I remember that it's face was dark, and it's body was brown, somewhat light brown.  Though, it could've been in the sun, which made it appear more light.  Again, it had a thin slender long face.</p><p>It's still really early in the year, so it's slender features make sense.  Bears don't get their full "puffy" figures until the end of the year.</p><p>According to some other articles, most bears shouldn't attack humans, but HELL NO, I'm not going to put that to the test.  As much as I would like to return to this path with a full day and a mountain bike, coming across another bear is way too damn risky.</p><p>Also, brown bears are on the list of endangered species.  So, even if I do encounter another bear, and if that bear attacks me, and if I'm able to defend myself, and kill it, I'll have to pay some enormous fine, and probably go to jail.  There are stories about that ALL the time despite being self defense.</p><p>I think my next attempt in the wilderness of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span> will be under a more official capacity, and in a car.</p><p><br/>Anyway, the road to Morimo through Shokawa was quite beautiful. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka Gattan Go!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go">Kamioka Gattan Go!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 26, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The northeast most town in Hida City, is Kamioka <span class='ja'>神岡</span>.  It currently has about 10,000 people, but there used to be a lot more.  15 years ago, there were 30,000 residents.  Many of those people were employed in the various zinc mines throughout the town and region.</p><p>And then in 2003 (I think) the zinc mine were closed.  Apparently zinc was no longer as useful as it once was, and the companies sold, closed, or abandoned the mines in the area.  Almost all the staff was cut, and residents began leaving the town and moving elsewhere for work.</p><p>With the mass exodus of residents, it no longer made sense to keep the Kamioka rail line open, so on December 1st, 2006, the rail line was closed, and abandoned.</p><p>It's still abandoned today, and is a rather prominent and visible symbol of Kamioka's urban decay.</p><p>Today, these railways have a unique present to contrast their flourishing past.</p><div class='title'><b>Gattan Go!</b></div><p>These days, you can ride the rails yourself on a bicycle contraption.  A few years after the railway closed, the NPO Kamioka-town network NPO<span class='ja'>法人神岡町づくりネットワーク</span> opened the Gattan Go! service!  2 or more people can reserve one of these railway bicycles and journey along Kamioka's railway for about 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> to 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> per person.</p><p>This past weekend, a few ALTs and I reserved a 4 person bicycle, and traveled on the old Kamioka railway. :)</p><p>The railway course is about 3km to the end, and another 3km back.  It starts from the old Hida Onsen Station and continues to the Kamioka Mining Station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" /></p><p>Here's the old Hida Onsen Station, or <span class='ja'>旧奥飛騨温泉口駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>おくひだ</span> <span class='ja'>おんせん</span> <span class='ja'>ぐち</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>).  It's now the central station for Gattan Go!  Inside there's a whole collection of trains, and some old photos of the line before it was decommissioned.  There's a Cafe outside, and a few other fun things.</p><p>We arrived a little early, so we looked at the photo spread of previous railway riders, and photos of the railway in different seasons.  It wasn't before too long that riders began returning from the time slot before us.  Almost 10 groups continued to show up around the bend, and arrive at the station.</p><p>At 4:30, the "foreman" had everyone in our time slot move into the briefing room.  He went through all the rules.  No getting off the bikes.  No stopping.  Always wear a helmet.  Blah, blah, blah…  You could still take photos, but you had to do so while staying on the bike.  Not a problem.</p><p>Luckily, our American group was the final group to leave the station, so we didn't have to worry about keeping a pace for everyone behind us.

The station building was torn down, and removed.  The entrance gate is totally wide open, so anyone could easy walk to the platform, then take a look around the railway.</p><p>After continuing along further, we entered the first of two major tunnels on the route.

The former Kamioka station building is now a hair salon.  I don't know if you can actually access the station platform anymore.  I think you have to go through the inside of the building, and it was closed when I checked.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" /></p><p>After we passed through Kamioka Station, we entered the second tunnel of the route, and this one is much longer than the first.

At this point, an attendant stopped everyone and turned the bikes around for the return journey.  We got to take a break, drink some water, and relax for a little while.</p><p>Before too long, we're back on the bike, and returning to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" /></p><p>Going from the Onsen Station to the Mining Station is pretty easy because the route is generally downhill.  It still feels really flat, though.  The return route is a fucking monster.  There were so many parts on the route where we kept peddling as much as we could, and we were still slowing down, and dragging.  I don't know if it was the bike we had, or if we're just that out of shape, but it was an actual workout to climb the tracks back to central.</p><p>We finally returned to the Onsen Station at 5:35.  A good 5 minutes late. :)  Good thing we were scheduled the last time slot of the day, and were the final group to depart.</p><p>Exhausted, and beat, we returned to our cars, and drove to a local yakiniku place for some delicious dinner.</p><p>Overall, it was a pretty fantastic and unique experience.  All of these old stations are pretty prominent in Kamioka, and after seeing them for the first time, I really wanted to get a better view.  Riding the bikes along these tracks was a great way to see everything up close, and take part of the history that was once the Kamioka railway.</p><p>As we finally departed Kamioka for the night, the tiny little castle shone beautifully in the darkening sky.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" /></p><p>Another way to experience the old railways is on youtube.  There's a few videos that people recorded from back in the day of the train traveling from the current Kamioka Inotani Station <span class='ja'>神岡猪谷駅</span> all the way to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p>This video was recorded in 1991: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY</a></p><p>And this one is quite a bit more recent: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI</a></p><p>In both videos, you can clearly see a whole lot of tanker cars parked at the Onsen and Mining stations, which carried all the zinc and whatever else they extracted from the Kamioka mines.</p><p>That first video is really helpful because it lists all the stations of the now abandoned line between the Inotani Station and the Onsen station:</p><p><span class='ja'>猪谷</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>茂住</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>漆山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡大橋</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨温泉</span></p><p>There's just 3 more stations outside of the central Kamioka area that are decommissioned: Hida Nakayama <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span>, Mozumi <span class='ja'>茂住</span>, and Urushiyama <span class='ja'>漆山</span>.  From the parts of the rail line we weren't able to ride on, there are some really beautiful bridges, and tunnels that are very very long.  Especially between the Mining station and the Urushiyama Station <span class='ja'>漆山駅</span>.  I think this requires some more exploring in the future. :)</p><div class='title'><b><i>Update</i></b></div><p>Near the end of summer vacation, I went to these abandoned rail stations: <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-railway" title="/kamioka-railway">September 1st</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Inuyama Tour 犬山市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/inuyama">Inuyama Tour 犬山市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 19, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the town of Kokufu, which is part of Takayama City, there's a beautiful set of waterfalls named the <span class='ja'>宇津江四十八滝</span>, or Utsue Yosohachi Waterfalls.  Though, from the name <span class='ja'>四十八</span>, which literally translates as 48, it's really easy to think that there are 48 waterfalls coming down the mountain.  That's what I thought when I saw the sign on the side of the road.  The following story is how that name came to be:</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend</b></div><p><i>The Japanese text is from the website.  I did my best translating it into English.</i></p><p>Once upon a time, in a village, there was a young man named Yoso-hachi <span class='ja'>よそ八</span>, who lived with his mother <span class='ja'>かか様</span>.  In the Spring, the mother caught a cold.  Because of how old she was, Yoso-hachi worried about her a lot.  His mother loved fish, so Yoso-hachi went to the river to catch an <span class='ja'>イワナ</span>, or Salvelinus (which is a kind of salmon).  Unfortunately, he couldn't catch any fish that day, and he wondered why.  He couldn't return home empty handed.  In the mountains of Utsue <span class='ja'>宇津江</span>, there was a big pond with a large serpent.  Yoso-hachi didn't know where this was, but somehow he got there.  The pond was so calm it looked like a mirror.  He cast his line in the pond, and was able to catch a beautiful shiny Salvelinus of 30cm.  Nearby, wrapped around a spotted chestnut tree, was the serpent.  It's eyes appeared to glow, but Yoso-hachi did not notice it.  With his fish, Yoso-hachi raced back home to heal his mother.  However, from the serpent's magical energy, Yoso-hachi had caught a fever, and was now bedridden, too.</p><p><span class='ja'>昔むかし、この里に「よそ八（はち）」という若者が「かか様」（母）と住んでいました。</span> <span class='ja'>ある年の春、かか様はちょっとした風邪がもとで寝込んでしまいました。なんといっても寄る年波なので、</span> <span class='ja'>起きて出る元気もなかったのです。</span> <span class='ja'>よそ八は魚の好きなかか様に食わせてやりたいとイワナをとりに行きました。</span> <span class='ja'>どうしたのやら、その日に限ってちっとも釣れないので、我を忘れてどんどん奥へわけいってしまいました。</span> <span class='ja'>宇津江の山奥には大沼があって大蛇がいるという話でした。よそ八は知らないうちに、とうとうその沼に来てしまいました。</span> <span class='ja'>沼は鏡のように静まり返っていました。釣り糸をたれると一尺（</span>30ｃｍ<span class='ja'>）もあるイワナが面白いほど釣れたのです。</span> <span class='ja'>ひょっと見ると、沼のふちの栗の木に大蛇が巻きついてランランと光る目で見ているので、びっくりして一目散に家へ逃げ帰りましたが、</span> <span class='ja'>大蛇の妖気に打たれて高い熱を出して寝込んでしまいました。</span></p><p>That night, he was visited by a young woman who nursed him back to health.  Every night for 10 days, this woman visited Yoso-hachi like it was a dream.  She finally spoke, "I am serpent who lives in the pond of Utsue <span class='ja'>宇津江</span>.  I have trained a thousand years by the sea, and a thousand years in the mountains, and now I can finally ascend to heaven.  Because you've shown great respect and care for your mother (<span class='ja'>親孝行</span> / <span class='ja'>おやこうこう</span> / Filial Piety), I have given you my blood.  I will create a storm and ascend to heaven.  And I shall never return."  The young woman then disappeared.  Later, a great monk heard this story and replied, "Wow!  You saved the serpent!"  And from that day, Yoso-hachi began praying to the Buddhist god Acala (<span class='ja'>不動明王</span> / <span class='ja'>ふどうみょうおう</span>).  21 days later, there was a great thunderstorm.  Lightning lit the skies, thunder cracked through the woods, and the rain was immense.  The serpent had now ascended to heaven to become a dragon.</p><p><span class='ja'>その夜、美しい旅の娘が訪ねてきて親切に看病してくれました。数十日後、すっかり元気になったよそ八の夢に娘が現れ、</span> <span class='ja'>「私は大沼に住む大蛇です。海に千年、山に千年の修行が終わったので、天に昇らなければなりません。親孝行のあなたを</span> <span class='ja'>助けてあげようと私の血をしぼって飲ませました。今の私は嵐を呼ぶ力も、天に昇る気力もなくなってしまいました。」</span> <span class='ja'>と告げ、二度と戻ってきませんでした。</span> <span class='ja'>話を聞いた偉い行者が「よし、わしがその大蛇を救って進ぜよう」と断食して不動明王に願掛けして祈祷を始めました。</span> <span class='ja'>・・・そして満願の二十一日目・・・天にわかにかき曇り稲妻が光り、雷鳴するどく大嵐となり、風を呼び雲を起こした大蛇は</span> <span class='ja'>龍になって天へ昇って行きました。</span></p><p>The Next day, when Yoso-hachi went to the valley, there were some 10 waterfalls carved out of the rugged rocks that shined brilliantly.  The big pond had dried up.  The chestnut tree, from the roots to its branches, was wrenched and twisted.  In later years, Koubou Daishi <span class='ja'>弘法大師</span>, a monk who had traveled to various countries, remarked, "Yoso-hachi is the reincarnation of Acala (or Fudoson / <span class='ja'>不動尊</span> / <span class='ja'>ふどうさん</span>).  In Buddhism, his name, Yo-So-Hachi, represents <span class='ja'>四</span> (yo), <span class='ja'>十</span> (so), <span class='ja'>八</span> (hachi)."  After that, everyone began to call the waterfalls <span class='ja'>四十八滝</span>, or Yoso-hachi waterfalls.  The waterfalls also became known for cleansing impurities.  This famous tale is very old, and these are all the facts that remain of it.</p><p><span class='ja'>翌日行ってみると渓はごつごつの岩肌が出て大小数十段の滝ができてキラキラと輝いていました。</span> <span class='ja'>そして大沼はすっかり干上がって、栗の木は根元から枝先までねじれてしまっていたのです。</span> <span class='ja'>後年、諸国修行の途上立ち寄った弘法大師が「その行者は不動尊の化身であり、よそ八（四十八）とは仏法四十八願を意味するものであろう。」</span> <span class='ja'>と言われ、以後この滝を四十八滝と呼ぶようになったと言うことです。</span> <span class='ja'>また四十八滝は不浄を忌み、不浄なことをすると必ず大夕立となり、昔より水乞いのとしても有名で各種の文献に史実が残されています。</span></p><div class='title'><b>Interpretation</b></div><p>So, again, <span class='ja'>四十八</span> literally translates to 48.  <span class='ja'>四</span> (yon) is kanji for 4.  <span class='ja'>十</span> (juu) is kanji for 10.  And <span class='ja'>八</span> (hachi) is kanji for 8.  But, kanji have many different readings.  From the story, <span class='ja'>四</span> can be read as 'yo', <span class='ja'>十</span> can be read as 'so', and <span class='ja'>八</span> is still read as 'hachi'.  Yoso-hachi, again, is the main character's name and the waterfalls are named after him.  Even the road signs in Kokofu mistranslate this as Shijuuhachi.  (Shi is the most secondary reading for 4 in Japanese.)</p><p>The Japanese language does this a lot with numbers.  That concept is known as Goroawase <span class='ja'>語呂合わせ</span>.  I wrote a little bit about this a while ago: <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase">November 7th, 2009</a>.  I think the most well-known one is 39.  39 translates to <span class='ja'>さんきゅう</span> or san-kyuu.  Saying "san-kyuu" sounds like Thank you.  So, Japanese people will try to get phone numbers with 39.  License plates, too.  They'll tack it on the end of their email address.  There's also a chain of a retail stores called 39.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>滝</span> / Waterfalls</b></div><p>Anyway, let's get on to the photos.</p><p>It takes a little while to drive to this area from Route 41.  There's plenty of parking, though.  The whole area is like a camp ground with a large flower field, and a hot spring museum, too. :)  As you walk up the road, you reach the bottom of the hiking trails that lead up Utsue <span class='ja'>宇津江</span> mountain.  And from there each waterfall is clearly marked with a little story about itself.  There are 13 named waterfalls as the water streams down the mountain over the rocks.</p><p><span class='ja'>滝</span>, or Taki, is the Japanese word for waterfall.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="title">1. <span class='ja'>魚返滝</span> / <span class='ja'>うおがえり</span> <span class='ja'>たき</span></div><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_utsue/IMG_7216.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_utsue/IMG_7216.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_utsue/IMG_7216.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_utsue/IMG_7216.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_utsue/IMG_7216.webp" /></a><br/><p>The first waterfall is named <b>Uogaeri</b>.  <span class='ja'>魚</span>, or uo, is another reading for sakana, or fish.  <span class='ja'>返る</span>, or kaeru, means to return.

Thousands of people come from around Japan, and around the world to view the beautiful festival floats, or yatai, as they are display during the day, and paraded through town at night.  I attended the Spring festival this year, and took a bunch of pictures.  You can view those here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.</p><p>But, if you aren't able to make it to the festivals, there are 2 museums in town that showcase festival floats, and you can view them anytime throughout the year.  There's the Takayama Festival Float Museum (<span class='ja'>高山祭屋台会館</span>), or Yatai-kaikan for short.  And there's the Hida Takayama Festival "Forest" (<span class='ja'>飛騨高山まつりの森</span>), or simply Matsuri no Mori.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>まつりの森</span> / Matsuri no Mori</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" /></p><p><span class='ja'>森</span> or mori, means forest in Japanese, though this museum really isn't a forest.  Even the plaque outside the building says, "Takayama Matsuri Museum."  It's located on the south end of town, and sits next two several other museums.  There's the tea ceremony museum, and a butterfly and insect museum.  There's also a playground in the forest behind the museums.  Maybe that's where the forest name comes from.</p><p>But, this place is definitely way more animated than a typical Japanese museum.  And while it looks very very small from the outside, the whole museum is actually house inside of an expanded geo-dome found in the hill. </p><p>As shown below, there's a long hallway dug into the mountain leading to the geo-dome.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" /></p><p>Along the left-side of the hallway leading to the geo-dome are miniature scale replicas of the 11 floats featured in the Autumn Takayama Festival.</p><p>On the right-side, there's some information showing how this museum was built.  There's also information about festival floats and which festivals actually use and display floats.  Apparently, there's only 6 festivals in Japan that actually use these kinds of floats.</p><p>There's the Takayama Festival <span class='ja'>高山祭</span> and the Furukawa Festival <span class='ja'>古川祭</span>.  Both of which are (basically) where I live in Gifu, Japan.  Up north, there's the Takaoka Kuruma-yama Festival <span class='ja'>高岡御車山祭</span>.  In Kyoto, their Gion Festival <span class='ja'>京都祇園祭</span> uses them too.  To the west of Tokyo in Saitama, the city of Chichibu has a Night Festival <span class='ja'>秩父夜祭</span> with floats.  Apparently, that one has fireworks, too. :)  And finally, there's the Hitachi Nagaremono Festival? <span class='ja'>日立風流物祭</span>.  I dunno.  Anyway, that's what the signs say.</p><p>Along with that information, there are some beautiful golden-lacquered folding screens depicting these festivals.  The Takayama Festival is in the photo above.</p><div class='title'><b>Festival Floats</b></div><p>As you proceed down the hallway, you enter the geo-dome, which houses 6 floats.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>According to the brochure, these 6 floats are sometimes rotated with other floats.

Each float's marionette's dance is meant to tell some kind of story and really highlight the meaning behind the float.</p><p>The following photos are from Kintokitai, Fukujutai, and Kinkeitai.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" /></p><p>The Kintokitai dance features a boy either attacking or warding off a bear on the very end of the float.  He dances and spins around, and at the end the bear (or the spirit of the bear) is defeated.</p><p>The Fukujutai dance features a man walking towards a peach and performing its dance.  He moves around, then a man with a cannon emerges from the peach.  That man moves around then fires a bunch of confetti out of the cannon into the crowd.</p><p>The Kinkeitai dance is a little more tame and simple.  It just features the marionette moving to the end of the float, dancing.  Then the man turns into a demon, and continues to dance.  Then he turns back into a human, and completes the dance.</p><p>Also, I watched the <span class='ja'>世界一大太鼓</span>, or The World's Largest Giant Taiko Drum performance.  3 marionettes turn to the drums, and begin beating a song.  It's a little creepy since these marionettes are life size, and they bow before and after the performance, which is a very "human" Japanese thing to do.</p><div class='title'><b>The Museum</b></div><p>Overall, I really like the museum.  I think it shows off the Festival floats and marionette dances really well, and in a unique atmosphere, too.  Though, I think it's just one step away from a Chucky Cheese, or Shony's Pizza Place.  It's all very animatronic, and the spotlights really focus your attention.  There's an announcer that always says what's going on, and how long before the next performance.</p><p>Also, inside the museum is a Crystal Cave, which was closed for some reason.  Maybe it's only open on the weekend, or something.</p><p>Matsuri no Mori is a bit expensive, too, at 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>.  I think by American standards, that's not too bad, but Japanese museums are usually half that price.  Of course, those museums lack that flare, and experience built into Matsuri no Mori.  This museum is very hands-on, and let's you have fun.  It might be worth the price if there's some kind of package deal that includes all the other museums in the area for a discount price.</p><p>But, I dunno.  I thought it was neat, and there was plenty of good information.  It's certainly more interesting than the Yaitai-kaikan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Yamada Elementary 山田小" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/yamada-elementary">Yamada Elementary 山田小</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And it too! had a governmental restructuring in recent years.  </p><p>In 2004, the towns of Furukawa and Kamioka joined with the villages of Kawai and Miyagawa to form Hida City.

So, really, technically, there's 3 and 5.</p><p>However, like most of Japan, there used to be more.  Much more!

It's directly on the side of the road in the middle of the Yamada neighborhood of Kamioka Town.</p><p>I'm guessing that it closed within the last 10 years, though.  The building isn't really falling apart.  Looking through the windows, there's plenty of crap piled up, and some things were simply left there without any thought.</p><p>The gym is still in use.

It's one of my favorite places in the Hida region.

There are plenty of castles in Gifu prefecture.  And Takayama has a former castle site, where you can hike.  Furukawa has a former castle site, too.  But, I'm pretty sure, Kamioka Castle in the only standing castle in the Hida region.</p><p>Kamioka Castle is located on the top of the one of the hills (or mountains) in town, and overlooks the entire downtown area.  It's right next to the Kamioka junior high school.  The castle area has 3 attractions. </p><p><span class='ja'>神岡城</span> - There's the castle itself: Kamioka Castle.</p><p><span class='ja'>鉱山資料館</span> / <span class='ja'>こうざん</span> <span class='ja'>しりょうかん</span> - There's the building you first see when you enter the area.

It's one of the center-most places in Japan, and on the west-end of Japan's most major mountain range.  The municipality of Takayama makes it the largest city in Japan based on land area.  9 years ago, it absorbed many of the neighboring villages in a governmental restructuring.  Many of these villages are nothing but mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods.</p><p>Takayama has about 90,000 residents.  Of that population, about 65,000 live in the central Takayama City, which is where I live.</p><p>I live at the northeastern base of one of the more prominent mountains in Takayama, Kita-yama.  At least, I think that's the name.  From my apartment, when I walk into the center of town, whether it be for drinking, or taking the train elsewhere, I have to go around the mountain one way or the other.</p><p>Recently, I've been taking a different route.  The path that leads straight up the mountain, and back down the other side.  It's much faster saving about 5 minutes.  And it's great exercise, too. :)</p><p>From Kita-yama, you have a great view of the entire downtown area.  Every time I walk past this amazing view, I can't help but take photos, even though they're the same ones I've taken several times before.</p><p>So, here you are.  There are photos I've taken from the early morning, mid-day, the evening, the sunset, and at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Downtown Takayama</b></div><p>(These are all panoramic shots, too, so you

recognize.</p><p>In these two close-ups you can see the gate of Hachiman Shrine.

It's where all the government in Takayama operates.</p><p>Between the two, landmarks is a white rectangular building.  That's one of the elementary schools I teach at, Nishi ES.  It actually has very few students.  Which may seem a bit weird being near the center of town, but there are a few other elementary schools nearby that cover the larger areas.
