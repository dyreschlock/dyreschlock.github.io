| August 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Out of all the kickstarter projects I've backed and "invested" in, Double Fine Adventure has been the most rewarding and unique experience out of them all.</p><p>Tim Schafer and his pals at Double Fine launched the Double Fine Adventure kickstarter on February 8th this year, and asked for $400,000 dollars to make a game that they've always wanted to make.  And not only that, they planned on filming an episodic documentary about their entire process.  And open up their creative process to the backers of the project for suggestions and ideas on what they might want in the game.</p><p>Here's a link to their Kickstarter campaign:<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure" title="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure</a></p><p>33 days after their kickstarter, it ended at $3,336,372 with an additional couple hundred thousand dollars donated outside of kickstarter.  It was the most successful campaign that kickstarter had seen to date.  The whole games industry took note.  And plenty of other classic game developers took note, and started their own campaigns, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts and Brutal Legend</b></div><p>I've been a big fan of Tim Schafer and Double Fine ever since I played <b>Psychonauts</b>. Psychonauts was the first game I played that Tim Schafer worked on, and playing through that game was an absolute delight (until the final stage).  The comedic dialogue, and funny characters worked themselves perfectly into the story, the game mechanics, and the overall world everything took place in.</p><p>It was one of the most fun and enjoyable experiences I've had with a game in quite a while.  And then they did it all again with <b>Brutal Legend</b> in 2009.  A perfect cohesive experience that carried its vision from start to finish with comedic tones guiding most of the mechanics of the world.</p><p>Not to say that these game aren't flawless.  But when the core concept of a game has a heart behind it, you can see past its flaws.</p><p>I wrote about both these games almost 3 years ago after finishing Brutal Legend<br/><a href="/old/v7/brutal-legend" title="/brutal-legend">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=673</a></p><p>Also, I got my copy of Brutal Legend signed by Tim Schafer!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Afterwards</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Brutal Legend sold terribly, and Double Fine really scaled back their games production.  Since Brutal Legend, I think Double Fine Adventure is the first game that Tim Schafer is actually directing himself.  They've made 5 games since then, and they have been rather small in scope, and mostly championed by other people on the Double Fine staff.</p><p>Tasha Harris, lead animator, directed <b>Costume Quest</b>, which was a cute downloadable game for XBLA, PSN, and Steam.  It featured a brother and a sister trying to save each other (depending on who you play as) from goblins during Halloween.  It was a turn-based RPG, and during the battles the kids would turn into the things they were costumed as for Halloween.</p><p>Lee Petty, art director, wrote and directed <b>Stacking</b>.  Stacking is about a kid trying to find his kidnapped family.  All the characters in the game are Russian Stacking dolls, and since you're the smallest, you can go inside other stacking dolls and use their character specific powers to solve puzzles and eventually rescue your family.</p><p>The Double Fine store sold a bunch of replicas of some of the characters in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp"  /></p><p>Then they did <b>Trenched</b> which was renamed to <b>Iron Brigade</b>.  Lead Designer, Brad Muir, headed up Iron Brigade.  This game is essential tower defense, but with a player playing a role on the field.  Your character pilots a mech and sets up missiles turrets to defend against evil broadcasting monsters.</p><p>The fourth game in this series is <b>Once upon a Monster</b> headed by lead programmer Nathan Martz.  Once upon a Monster stars all the monsters from Sesame Street in a learning game for kids using the Kinect.  According to Wikipedia, this initially wasn't intended to be a licensed game, but everything seemed to fit after working on it for a while.</p><p>All the mistakes and lessons learned from working with the Kinect spawned an unintended fifth game in the series entitled, <b>Double Fine Happy Action Theater</b>.  This Kinect title isn't so much a game, as it is a whole lot of random visualizations and interactions made possible with the Kinect.</p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Adventure</b></div><p>They're currently in the process of working on a game headed by Ron Gilbert, the creator of Monkey Island.  But Tim wanted to work on a game, too.  He hadn't been directly in charge of a game since Brutal Legend, and wanted to do something again.  And rather than shop an idea around from publisher to publisher to publisher getting rejected, he decided to do a kickstarter campaign and see what would happen.</p><p>And success happened.</p><p>And now we're 5 months after the Kickstarter has ended, and they've released 4 episodes of their documentary so far.  The first episode dealt with the creation of the kickstarter and its success.  The second episode dealt with Tim's creation process, and a few ideas he had come up with.  He also went over these ideas with Ron Gilbert, and they talked a little bit about what adventure games meant, and how they should be designed.</p><p>The third episode was Tim bringing his ideas to his team, getting feedback, and working through the feedback.  They also introduced Anna Kipnis as the lead developer, and her team setting up the animation and game engine.  They also came up with the codename for the project, "Reds", as they did the Double Fine pub crawl.</p><p>The fourth episode, released today, was an extended double length episode that focused on the concept artists for the project, and their process.  They introduced Peter Chan, and Scott Campbell, visited their work spaces, and their lives.  They also introduced Nathan "Bagel" Stapley as the lead artist for the project, and showed him off too.</p><p>Each episode has been about a month apart, and has really shown the project taking shape.  From the small ideas that Tim had in episode two, into some fleshed out stories, and concept art in episode four.  Each episode has done a fantastic job focusing on the passion of everyone involved, and especially with Tim himself.  With all the money they raised, he's able to hire all the people he really loves and inspires him to create great things.</p><p>The whole idea with this project has been to create something that was completely outside of publishers.  For his process, publishers tend to stifle and warp his ideas into something that sells, rather than something that comes from the heart.  And even though I feel like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend had plenty of heart, I wonder just how toned down they were from the original idea.</p><p>It's great to see a creative team have all the freedom they want, and have them explain what inspires them, and ultimately what makes them happy.  And given that I've loved almost all of their games, it's really fulfilling and inspiring to me to see it build and come together.</p><p>It's pretty great.</p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Adventure Swag</b></div><p>And additionally, they've actually fulfilled all of their upfront physical goods too.  I pledged $100, which awards a physical copy of the Game and the Documentary in a classic over-sized PC box.  Those will obviously only be available upon completion of the game and documentary, but the upfront goods I got are a Poster, and a T-shirt!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp"  /></p><p>It includes a sticker, and a button too!</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I'm certainly looking forward to all the rest of the episodes.  But!  In the immediate future, Double Fine is going to have a bit of a presence at PAX this year.  They plan on having a booth in the exhibition hall, they are having a panel specifically on Double Fine Adventure, and they are taking part of two other panels.</p><p>Friday @ 1pm : Double Fine Adventure Panel w/ Tim Schafer (Double Fine), Greg Rice (Double Fine), Paul Levering (Player 2 Productions), and Cindy Au (Kickstarer).  They are showing some clips from the documentary and then answering a bunch of questions.</p><p>Saturday @ 7:30pm : Canceled &amp; Prototyped Games w/ Brad Muir (Double Fine), Amir Rao (Supergiant), Dan Teasdale (Twisted Pixel), and Sylvain Dubrofsky (Popcap).</p><p>Sunday @ Noon : Plot v. Play - Duality of Modern Game Design w/ Ben Gilbert (Joystiq), Jason Schreier (Kotaku), Tim Schafer (Double Fine), and Erik Wolpaw (Valve).</p><p>I plan on attending each of one of these, but I especially plan on attending the Double Fine Adventure one.  </p><p>Additionally, The Cave is going to be in the Exhibition Hall at SEGA's booth.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wavefront Music Festival - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wavefront-music-festival-day-2">Wavefront Music Festival - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 12, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Saturday was pretty fun, I was really looking forward to today, Sunday.  Today we have Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, Eric Prydz, and Sasha.  Guy Gerber has been solidifying his name among the best in the business over the last couple of years.  Eric Prydz has been HUGE in all the circles of electronic music.  And Sasha is a living legend.  Sasha's involvement guaranteed my sale from the first day tickets went on sale.</p><p>Five and I woke up from our long day of music, and finally left the house around Noon Thirty, I think.  The skies were pretty clear, but there were some bizarre storm warnings that came across the morning news and the weather reports.  One report announced a Severe Thunderstorm warning from 12:45 to 1:30, which we thought was odd.  The radar had absolutely no storm activity in the Chicago area.</p><p>We were directly West of downtown a couple of miles, so our plan was to drive down Lake St., then north up Michigan Ave, to Lake Shore Dr., and then get to the beach.  During the 20 minutes it took us to drive 4 miles to Michigan Ave, the sky turned completely dark.  Huge black clouds surrounding down Chicago.  And winds blew around all kinds of trash and debris.  People walking around on the streets quickly went inside of building to shield themselves for the horror that was about to dump in the downtown area.</p><p>Five and I turned onto Michigan Ave, and got onto Lake Shore Dr. pretty quickly.  Over Lake Michigan there were clear blue skies, but looking West was the direct opposite.  Five continued to drive north, and the clouds emptied on to the city.  We seemed to escape it, though, as only a couple of drops hit our car.  We passed a couple of downed trees by the beach, where everyone was evacuating.</p><p>We reached Montrose beach, which is about 6 miles north of downtown.  All of the storm clouds really stayed directly over Chicago.  There were gray clouds above where we were, but the really dark horrific ones were south.  It was very bizarre.</p><p>Rather than head out to the beach in the middle of a storm, Five and I walked to a nearby restaurant to meet up with our pal, Brian, to wait out the storm.  40 minutes later, we exited the restaurant.  The skies were a little gray, but the storm definitely passed.  By the time, we actually got to the opening gate for Wavefront, you couldn't even tell that a storm was there.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp"  /></p><p>Well, except for the line of people waiting to get in.  Wavefront shut down, and evacuated everyone for 2 hours for fear of storm damage.  A fire department helicopter was circling the beach, and accessing the current weather before Wavefront could proceed with its event.  We were in line only a little while before the Fire department gave the go ahead, and people were admitted entrance.</p><p>Five, Brian, and I made it in around the same time we got in on Saturday, about 3pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp"  /></p><p>I went straight over to the North Stage to see who was on deck.  <b>Danny Daze</b> was spinning a fantastic groovy House set to welcome the crowd back into the festival.</p><p>By the way, along the sides of each stage were a bunch of VIP cabanas.  The North Stage had 3 big ones, and 4 smaller ones.  Each of those Large cabanas cost $10000 to rent for the weekend.  They included plenty of accommodations on top of the prime real estate, but yikes...  I think I'd rather buy a car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>We wandered around a little bit though, and found ourselves over at the South Stage, where <b>Betatraxx</b> was spinning a rather hilarious set.</p><p>The tracks he played was a perfect example of why a lot of people don't take dubstep seriously.  He played a dubstep remix of the <b>Requiem for a Dream</b> epic ending song.  He followed it up with a dubstep remix of the <b>Epic Fight Music</b>.  And then went into a dubstep remix of <b>NES Punch Out</b>.  After which he threw in some classical music, and other dubstep remixes of random well known songs.  It's a prime example of pandering to the crowd for cheap cheers rather than actually building an incredible vibe that stands on its own.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp"  /></p><p>We were really just waiting around for <b>Nadia Ali</b> and <b>Chris Lake</b> to show up.

He built on the sound Benoit &amp; Sergio started and subtly crept in his own sound.  Seamless.</p><p>And what Guy Gerber started, <b>Steve Lawler</b> built upon.  He absolutely set me on fire.  I don't know why I had a negative opinion of him before, but his set was the perfect build up.  Everything started with Benoit &amp; Sergio into Guy Gerber into Steve Lawler, and just kept building and building, hour after hour.

He piled on that raw classic sound with the fresh chill sounds of summer.</p><p>I think trying to describe the sound of his set is a bit futile.  I mentioned in a <a href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago" title="/sasha-spybar-chicago">previous post</a> that aside from his darker raw progressive house sound, he has a more Tech House / Indie House kind of sound that he's been spinning at his 'Never say Never' events at Ushuaia Beach Resort in Ibiza.  But at this point his Tech House / Indie House vibe has completely taken over, but with his signature style underneath.</p><p>Over the last year, he's been in the studio producing some of his own music.  He's released a few tracks on his Last Night of Earth record label, as well as working on the third installment of his Involver CD series, which he's been somewhat secretive about.</p><p>He started 'Never say Never' because he felt he wasn't playing tracks from all the artists he loved, and, now, 3 years later, he's made that sound his own.  He's separated himself from the other Progressive House kings, and puts himself alongside Guy Gerber, Benoit &amp; Sergio, and all the other DJs that spin a more Tech House vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp"  /></p><p>His set from Wavefront was the perfect soundtrack to a warm summer day.

To finish of his set he rolled into one the signature tracks of his upcoming Involver 3 album.  I was going crazy at this point.</p><p>Hot Chip - Flutes (Sasha Invol&lt;3r Remix)</p><p>Sasha was amazing, and put together with the festival as a whole, <b>Wavefront</b> was an incredible experience.  After going to North Coast and Spring Awakening, it was amazing going to a festival where I was completely in tune with the music.  I liked plenty of artists from North Coast and Spring Awakening, but both festivals have all the acts I care about in a Swiss cheese pattern.  Both festivals are geared towards the new generation of electronica fans, and the music I care about gets shoved in whatever time slots remain.</p><p>I really hope SpyBar achieved the success they hoped for with Wavefront, and I hope they make this a yearly event.  Though, it did kind of feel like a one off.  With all the popular electronic dance music these days, I think Chicago needed a reminder about what kind of electronic dance music makes this city unique.  And I think they definitely got it with Wavefront.</p><p>To finish, I'll leave you with my favorite quote from the reviews following the event.</p><p><em>"The Spring Awakening is the party that the kids thrown when their parents are away for the weekend whereas The Wavefront Music Festival is the party the parents throw once their kids go away to college."</em> - <a href="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2012/07/01/wavefront_music_fest_day_one_-_no_drop_no_love/index.php" title="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2012/07/01/wavefront_music_fest_day_one_-_no_drop_no_love/index.php">Katie Karpowicz</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wavefront Music Festival - Day 1" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wavefront-music-festival-day-1">Wavefront Music Festival - Day 1</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 4, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The summer of music festivals continued this last weekend with the Wavefront Music Festival.  Wavefront was hosted by Spy Bar on Chicago's Montrose Beach, slightly north of the downtown area.  The purpose of Wavefront was to bring together the old crowd of electronic music lovers, with the new crowd.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp"  /></p><p>For the past couple of years, React has grown and grown and become the leader in electronic entertainment in Chicago, and the type of talent they've brought to Chicago has been mostly mainstream.</p><p>I complained about this a little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">Spring Awakening</a> post, but as dubstep, electro house, and other certain genres have become quite mainstream, the other genres are starting to become second class citizens.  At first, there was room for everyone, and all of electronic dance music seemed to flourish, but these days it seems like those genres are getting choked out by the popular crap.</p><p>I think the fans of true dance music are starting to notice, and fight back a little bit.  There was an article a couple weeks ago, railing on the popular DJs today, enforcing that they don't even play DJ sets.  They basically just play rock concerts.  They play the same set from front to back without little variation at all.  They don't play to the crowd.</p><p>And that's exactly what the kids these days want.  They go to these major events to hear their favorite tunes, rather than hear something new or reactive to the vibe.  That's why so many of these DJs are playing the same songs from the last 3 or 4 years, and why they play so many pandering dubstep remixes.  The crowds at these concerts <b>only seem to care about the content of the song</b>, rather than the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Wavefront had two stages, the North stage and the South stage.  The South stage had plenty of electro house, dubstep, and other popular crap.  They had such acts as Bad Boy Bill, MSTRKRFT, Erick Morillo, Chris Lake, John Dahlback, Eric Prydz, and Duck Sauce.</p><p>The North Stage had me sold on Day 1, though.  They had Visionquest, Art Department, Matthew Dear, Benoit &amp; Sergio, Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, and <b>Sasha</b>.  All groovy mellow house, whether it be Progressive House, Deep House, or Tech House.</p><div class='title'><b>Day 1 - Saturday</b></div><p>Five and I both purchased weekend passes for this event, and went down to Chicago on Saturday afternoon.  We got to the beach around 3 o'clock, right in the middle of <b>Visionquest's</b> set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp"  /></p><p>Visionquest played a very nice mellow opener set for the day.  It wasn't outrageous or over top.  It was the perfect start for the day.  And the perfect set up for <b>Art Department</b>.</p><p>Art Department played an amazing bass heavy deep house set.  I recognized a couple of tunes from some of their previous sets, and ones from Sasha, too.  This was how I knew I was home at this festival.  The crowd responded and grooved along with the set, and Art Department kept pumping in the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The sound from the North Stage was incredible.

These guys are one of the few electro groups that I haven't written off yet.  Underneath their occasional obnoxious sounds, they still carry a beat.  It's still Dance music.  Most popular tracks these days, and Dubstep especially really isn't dance music as much as it is "rock-out" music.  You can't dance to it.  You throw your fists and arms in the air, and rock out, or rage out to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, MSTRKRFT's set didn't really evolve over time.  When they transitioned from track to track, it felt more like they were simply changing it up, rather than building on whatever vibe they had set.  So, after awhile, it really didn't carry as much weight.  It went back to the mentality of having a set list, rather than a vibe.

The author, Lars Martinson, taught from 2003 to 2006 in Fukuoka, Japan.  I assume he means Fukuoka prefecture, and not Fukuoka city.  The story is set in the small fictional town of Tonoharu, and mentions its about an hour away from any major city.</p><div class='title'><b>Prologue</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp"  /></p><p>Before we get into the actual story of Tonoharu, Lars starts everything off in the prologue.  These several pages focus on Lars himself as he nears the end of his first year contract.  He reflects on the past 8 months of his stay in Japan, and wonders whether or not to renew.  The life hasn't been what he expected, and he's had several challenges to face he wasn't prepared for.</p><p>I think this section is rather brilliant, because through explaining his own situation, we're also introduced to the actual characters in the book.  He also foreshadowing all the events to happen over the course of the 3 book series as well.  All things I didn't pay attention to at all until I read it a second time.</p><div class='title'><b>Part One</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp"  /></p><p>The main character in Tonoharu is <b>Dan Welles</b>, and he is Lars' predecessor.  The story focuses on Dan's experience teaching abroad.  It begins with Dan meeting his own predecessor, and attending his welcoming party.  It continues with Dan's first classes at his school, and giving his self-introduction class lesson.  And it expands on Dan's character, and introduces several other characters too.</p><p>The story throughout Part One seems like a pretty good introduction to the type of situations one would have when teaching English in Japan's grade school system.  I guess it's implied that Dan is in the JET Programme, but it's never directly referenced.  Also, given that Lars' started JET in 2003, I'm assuming that this is supposed to take place in 2002.  I'm not sure why Dan doesn't have a cellphone, or why he never researches anything on a computer.  This ain't the 90s.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp"  /></p><p>Dan is a completely fictional character.  Well... at least, I really hope he's completely fictional.  Dan is an unconfident unprepared unmotivated person.  He doesn't seem to have any hobbies, or desires, or any real personality.  He kind of acts like some people I used to know...</p><p>At first, I figured the guy was just shy.  I consider myself a little bit shy, so I can relate, and being thrown into certain situations can make me very nervous, and seemingly uninteresting, or boring, or whatever.  So, at the beginning, I figured Dan was just adjusting to the new culture and taking things slow.</p><p>But he never pulls himself out of this rut.  I don't think he's too afraid to branch out, he just doesn't know how to.  I guess he does try asking people about what things to do, and he tries to make friends with people...  and they all blow him off.  But he just stops at that point.  He feels like all of his avenues are cut off, so he doesn't know how to take care of himself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp"  /></p><p>...and as such, he gets even more depressed.</p><p>This guy is basically the Charlie Brown of the JET Programme.  Nothing seems to go his way, and he keeps taking all the shit that life gives him.</p><div class='title'><b>Part Two</b></div><p>Part Two represents a bit of a change for the series.  It still focuses on Dan, and his incredible unmotivated depression, but expands on all the characters introduced in Part One.  In fact, I think Lars spends way too much time on the character interactions that the uniqueness of this taking place in Japan seems to fade away.  I guess that could represent that over time all the things that seem unique and interesting become normal and mundane because you're used to them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp"  /></p><p>But he's really building a story.  I think the down to earth nature of the comic is absolutely it's strong point, he really needs a story, and I think that's when the fictiveness of the entire series starts breaking the reality a bit.  Now we have the kooky rich europeans that the whole town hates.  And the stereotypical "playboy" who sleeps with all kinds of women.  And a love interest too! though that trope felt very natural in its execution.</p><p>Overall, I think it's still very good.  And the art is really unique too.  It's very simple and straightforward like a typical newspaper comic, but has an incredible amount of detail and complexity when it needs it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Part Three</b></div><p>This is a 3 part graphic novel series, and, at the moment, only two volumes have been finished.  He's definitely working on the final book of the series.  In a semi-recent <a href="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/" title="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/">blog post</a> he mentions that he's a third of the way complete!</p><p>Also, reading through Lars' blog, it seems that he's back in Japan again, and he's been writing a web comic series about his current misadventures entitled the <b>Kameoka Dairies</b>.  This series is much more direct about specific subjects he's come across from daily life in Japan, rather than building an all encompassing story.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>This series does feel a bit negative about the experiences one might have when teaching English in Japan, but after taking a hard look at the main character, it feels like he's done this to himself.  If you're active, know how to ask questions, and have motivation to get the most out of life, I don't think you'd have as rough a time as our pal Dan did.</p><p>I think if you've ever been in JET, or are interested in joining JET, this book series is a must read.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Before Watchmen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/before-watchmen">Before Watchmen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 24, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Starting at the beginning of June, DC Comics has finally begun releasing the much talked and debated about comic book series, <b>Before Watchmen</b>.  After the massive success of the 2009 film adaptation of The Watchmen, DC began thinking about ways it could further monetize the series with the surge of new fans.  I didn't even realize these comics were finally out until I visited my local comic book store.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp"  /></p><p>Before Watchmen is a series of 7 separate comic book series where each series focuses on a single character from The Watchmen, except the comic series, The Minutemen, which focuses solely on the original group of masked vigilantes that preceded The Watchmen.  Each comic explains the origins or motives behind the character leading into the story of The Watchmen itself.</p><p>The idea is that a new comic will come out each week from June until January.  You can find the schedule from this website <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035" title="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035">here</a>.  The Minutemen, Ozymandias, and The Comedian all are 6 issues series, whereas the other 4, Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, and Rorschach are all 4 issues series.  All in all, there are 34 issues, and plus an extra 48-page one shot to tie everything together at the end.  We are 3 weeks into June, and as such, there have only been 3 issues released so far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Controversy</b></div><p>The most vocal person against the idea of more Watchmen comics is one of the creators, <b>Alan Moore</b>.  In 2009, just as DC was about the launch the movie, Alan Moore spoke out about how this film was nothing more than a money making scheme.  DC had run out of ideas, and the only way to make money was to take projects with integrity that stand on their own, and somehow cash them in.  He even refused to accept any royalties he would've received from the creation of the film.</p><p>In that case, I think any complaints he had about the idea of a film were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming positive praise of the film's execution.  For years, people said you couldn't do a Watchmen movie because it was too complicated, but Zack Snyder pulled it off, in my opinion and many others.  It was fantastic, and (mostly) stuck strictly to the script of the comic.</p><p>Alan Moore is back again in the spotlight as a HUGE dissenter of Before Watchmen.  A few years after the original comic of The Watchmen was finished in the 1980s, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons were thinking about how they might expand the series.  They thought about having a story focus on each character, but didn't really think it would work.  They really wanted to do a full story about The Minutemen, though, but DC weren't interested at the time.  For years, DC shot down any ideas Alan Moore brought up about a revival of The Watchmen, and created some rather bad blood between the two.</p><p>So when, DC finally came back to Alan Moore about expanding The Watchmen in the mid-2000s (citation needed), Alan Moore refused.  And he has been incredibly against the idea of Watchmen revival ever since.</p><p>So, the actual <b>controversy</b> of these books is "will they actually live up to the original comics."  Is this just another ploy for cash they will ultimately cheapen The Watchmen franchise.  Or are these new books actually just?  Are these worthwhile reads, and important to the overall story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Minutemen #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp"  /></p><p>For The Minutemen, I think this issue matches the expectations.  It focuses on the development of The Minutemen as a group, framed in Hollis writing his novel.  It introduces all the characters, their psyche, motives, and personalities, and ends on the catalyst that brings them all together.</p><p>While I'm not a huge fan of the art in the original comic, I can definitely respect the art in The Minutemen.  It's carefully constructed in such a way you feel like you're reading the original.  The dialogue is set up the same.  The art is the same.  And the flow of the comic is exactly the same too.  It's a new Watchmen comic.  All the pieces are there.  And the story is pretty solid so far.</p><p>I think it's pretty good :)</p><div class='title'><b>Silk Spectre #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp"  /></p><p>On the other hand, we have Silk Spectre.  The art does not mimic the original, and neither does the story telling.  It's a completely new comic.  And I think this is what Alan Moore was afraid of.</p><p>Silk Spectre #1 tells the story of Silk Spectre II in high school, and her first romance.  As indicated by the second photo, occasionally a panel will have a Chibi version of the character expressing an inner emotion.  The type of thing you'd find in a comic designed for girls.</p><p>Also, the story is a typical high school girl rebel story of falling in love, and doing anything to be with that unrequited love.  Romeo and Juliet, and so forth.  Another easy stereotypical plot device often used in story designed for girls.</p><p>So, Silk Spectre #1 is pretty dumb, and shameless.  It's specifically trying to pull in the female audience through the ONE female character in the story.  Ohhh, since she's female she's gotta have a high school love story.  And she's a tomboy, so all the other girls make fun of her.  Blah blah blah... it's so cliche.</p><p>But I do like how the comic has its own identity.  This is Silk Spectre's story, and it's completely framed using her personality.  The art is different and unique compared to the other comic, and so is the story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Comedian #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp"  /></p><p>The Comedian follows the same suit.  It's written and drawn by different people, so it has a look and feel and storytelling style of its own.</p><p>The story of the comedian so far is a bit boring.  But it's building to something quite a bit larger.  In the beginning of the comic, Eddie Blake is playing football with John F Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy on the White House lawn.  It establishes that they're all very good friends, and they know each other pretty well.</p><p><b>Spoilers</b>, but at the end of Issue #1, Eddie corners Moloch, and Moloch shows Eddie the TV.  JFK has been fatally shot.  Eddie is surprised and shocked, and looks for the nearest amount of alcohol to calm himself.</p><p>Do you remember the slide show at the beginning of The Watchmen film when it goes through the background stories of The Minutemen, and formation of The Watchmen?  There's a scene that shows Eddie Blake as the second gunman behind the grassy knoll during the assassination of JFK.</p><p>So, if that was canon, why would he be surprised when hearing about the assassination from Moloch?  This doesn't seem to make sense.  Though, this might've been something they just added in the movie, and it's not actually canon with the book.  But I don't think Zack Snyder was adding in random shit at the beginning.</p><p>I'm curious to see how this continues.</p><div class='title'><b>More to come!</b></div><p>Looking at <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035" title="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035">the schedule</a> once again, Comedian #6 is one of the final comics to be released, along with Ozymandias and The Minutemen.  It feels like those are the 3 PRIME story driven comics out of all of these.</p><p>I mean, who really cares about Silk Spectre when she's not around Dr. Manhattan or Nite Owl.  I want to know more about The Minutemen, and the pure motives behind Ozymandias' overall deceit.  Though, I'm sure Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach's stories will be very entertaining on their own.</p><p>Anyways, a new Watchmen comic every week for the next 7 months?  Hell yeah, why not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ Soldier Field, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">The Spring Awakening @ Soldier Field, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It used to be a single night event with two or three major headliners, but with the massive popularity of electronic dance music continuing to surge, and React, the promotion company, continuing to pull off massive successful events, The Spring Awakening has expanded to an entire two day music festival.  It took place at Soldier Field in Chicago, and had the main stage on to the football field itself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp"  /></p><p>When The Spring Awakening was first announced I was super excited because the (initial) lineup included <b>Markus Schulz</b> and <b>Ferry Corsten</b>, two heavy hitters in Trance.  One of my favorite duos, <b>Gabriel &amp; Dresden</b> were also on the bill.  And <b>Moby</b>, too!  Later on <b>Carl Cox</b> and <b>Green Velvet</b> were also added.</p><p>On the other side of the coin were acts such as Skrillex, Wolfgang Gartner, Laidback Luke, Benny Benassi, Diplo, etc, etc.  I tried to like these guys when they started to become popular, but I can't get into it.  There's no atmosphere, or melody for me to enjoy.  I really don't dig its sound.  It's not relaxing, or uplifting, or groovy.  It doesn't take me on a journey.  Blah blah blah... damn kids.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday</b></div><p>I arrived around 6pm on Saturday.  I took a look around for a while, and proceeded to the "Trance" Tent, aka 'Da Drive Stage' where Morgan Page, Gabriel & Dresden, and Markus Schulz were going to perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp"  /></p><p>Joachim Garraud was already spinning some tunes when I arrived.  There's no way this guy is a real DJ.  The last half of set had so many randomly stereotypical popular songs.  "We are your Friends", "Smack my Bitch up", and "Sandstorm"!  Sandstorm!  In 2012, Sandstorm was played at one of the largest dance events Chicago has ever held.  It blows my mind that anyone would consider playing that song.</p><p>After that horrible experience, Morgan Page hopped on stage and played a rather mediocre set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp"  /></p><p>I had been making my way up to the front throughout Morgan Page's set.  Once he left the stage, he took a lot of the audience with him.  I suppose everyone left for  <b>Ferry Corsten</b> on the main stage, but I stuck around for Gabriel &amp; Dresden.</p><p>Unfortunately, they performed a very standard set.  :/  Out of all their tracks, there was only one that I hadn't heard before.  I had a lot of fun hopping around to all of their recent hits, but there were no surprises whatsoever.  They could've played some amazing classic Trance hit, or wowed everyone with a new Mashup, but it felt like we got the minimal amount of what they were willing to do.  They really phoned it in. :(  What a waste...</p><p>I probably should have joined everyone else for Ferry Corsten, but I still had a good time rocking out to the tunes.  I was right up front, and there was a dude next to me rocking out just as much.  He bought me a couple beers!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1261.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1266.webp"  /></p><p>The absolute best part of the day was when Markus Schulz took over the decks.  He played an absolutely phenomenal set.  Absolutely amazing.  It felt like time literally stopped in the aura of atmosphere he spun with his set.  The vibe never quit, and continued to build and build and build.  It was awe inspiring.  I feel bad for having listened to him on Internet radio for more than 10 years, and JUST NOW seeing him live.  Out of an evening of mediocre and terrible performances, Markus Schulz shined so brightly.</p><p>Horse Head guy was blown away too!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Markus closed out the Trance Tent for the evening, and everyone begun to question whether to outright leave, or go into Soldier Field for Skrillex.  I'll admit that I did like Skrillex in the beginning.  His sound was quite different than everything else.  It was very fresh and distinct.</p><p>But now the industry is completely saturated by imitators and trend-followers.  I listened to Skrillex's set for about 20 minutes, and was surprised how his sound has completely faded into the genre he (somewhat) created.  I thought Skrillex was supposed to be at the front of this sound, but he sounds just like everyone else. it feels like he's having a hard time differentiating himself from his followers.  The only real difference he has is his signature look, and his ridiculous amount of energy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp"  /></p><p>So, I left.

His DJ performances are a stark difference than his original work.  His original work is very ambient and uplifting, whereas his DJ performance are very hard and energetic.</p><p>His DJ performances used to be super super rare, but ever since 'Last Night' in 2008, he's been back in the clubs, and each year he's been DJing more and more.  I came across a couple of his recorded sets, and wrote my impressions about it <a href="/old/v7/moby-djing" title="/moby-djing">here</a>, but I never had the chance to actually hear him live.</p><p>Today was finally the day, and his set turned out exactly how he had portrayed himself in those recordings.  High energy, but overall lacking.  I wouldn't say it lacked individuality, but it's missing something...  for me, anyway.  There's no hook.  There's no...  something.  His sets aren't really memorable.  I don't know.</p><p>Maybe it's just hard for me to separate Moby the artist, from Moby the DJ.  Maybe I'm just giving him a pass because I know he's a good artist.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Anyway, I left before Moby finished his set, so I could return to Madison and get to work the next day.</p><p>Markus Schulz, Derrick Carter, Green Velvet, and Carl Cox made my weekend, and I was quite satisfied.  Gabriel &amp; Dresden were fun, but were a bit disappointing.  Moby was ok, and I missed Ferry Corsten, but other than there were no other DJs and artists I really cared about.</p><p>The Spring Awakening was mostly a festival that mirrored the sound of today's electronic dance generation, and not my own.  That's why I am SUPER excited for the Wavefront Music Festival at the end of June.  This is packed full of the sounds I love, and artists I follow.  I can't wait.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1866.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1866.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Minecraft" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-minecraft">Lego Minecraft</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 15, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I finally received my very own set of Minecraft Legos, as well as a couple of stickers.  I think this is the first Lego product I've bought (or received) in the last 20 years.  Some might think the idea of Lego Minecraft is ironic.  Others might say this serves absolutely no purpose.  Some might say this was only a matter of time.  And others might say it's art imitating art.</p><p>Minecraft is a computer game developed by swedish person Markus Persson, where you can destroy any piece of the environment, pick that piece up, and place it where ever you want.  Many people describe this game as Legos in of itself, as you move around pieces, and build whatever you want.  That's the mining part of Minecraft.</p><p>The other part of Minecraft is the crafting.  You can take these pieces that you've mined and created new objects, and build more elaborate structures beyond what the environment has given you to begin with.  And you can do whatever you want.</p><p>Many people describe Minecraft is "playing with Legos." In fact, you could argue that Minecraft is the truest most best Lego video game ever created.  Lego has put its stamp on countless other games and all that them fail at the basic concept of what Lego is 'built' on...</p><p>So it IS deeply ironic that this concept has come full circle into the physical realm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Development</b></div><p>This set of Legos has been in development since November last year.  As you might have noticed above, the brand Lego Cuusoo is thrown around a little bit.  Cuusoo is an online development program where Lego creators bring their ideas to a vote.</p><p>Here's the original Cuusoo entry for Minecraft : <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038" title="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038">http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038</a></p><p>All Cuusoo ideas are submitted and put to a vote.  If the idea gets 10,000 supporters, it goes into a development phase where the creators must prove their idea.  Once they've come up with a physical build of the Lego product, it's put in front of a panel of judges, and they vote on whether or not the product actually comes to market.</p><p>Legos are WAAYYYY more serious these days then they were when I was a kid.  I mean, at heart, they are still a kid's toy, and they plenty of sets for children.  But they have advanced sets for the people who grew up with the toy, and enjoy the simple aesthetic.  And even beyond that, this Cuusoo system is there for the people who enjoy building something out of nothing: The architect.  These days the toy goes beyond an age range, and delves into the intellectual range.</p><p>It's awesome that there's this creative outlet for all Lego architects out there, but I've almost always been more interested in the building aspect of Legos.  I liked deviating from the instructions when I was a kid, but I never had the resources to build something from nothing.  These days you can visit any of the Legoland locations and buy any specific Lego piece you need.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Building</b></div><p>Building this thing was pretty fun.  I followed the instructions, and built everything 'correctly'.  Minecraft has always been about digging under the surface and finding all the hidden treasures.  Through building a scene of your own, you are doing the exact opposite.  You are placing all the hidden ore, and items in the environment and covering them up.  It's almost like you're acting like the scenery generator in the game itself.</p><p>There are gold blocks and diamond blocks that are very obviously placed, but there are other elements placed within the scene that are completely obscured when viewing the finished product.  In the end, the builder is the only one that knows they're there.  It's a secret.</p><p>There's also a Lego Steve, and a Lego Creeper available in the set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess it's kind of dumb.  Despite Legos' timeless and ageless construction, I feel like I've grown out of them.  I loved them as a kid, but the aesthetic just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  I get that the limited construction of the tool has pushed the creativity of its users well beyond what it was originally intended for, and built its own community, Cuusoo, based on that, but...  I just feel like I'm passed them.  I don't enjoy the aesthetic anymore.  It's too distinctive.</p><p>Once the Lego structure is built...  then what?  It just sits on display.</p><p>But... I do appreciate this Lego set.  <b>I find it as art imitating art.</b> There are clear choices made in its construction that imitate the game exactly.  A 1x1x2 block of Lego is equivalent to a block in Minecraft, and that is consistent throughout the entire model.  You can't really mine any of the pieces, but its construction and existence mirrors the game.</p><p>It's very well done, and representative of the game.  Much like the feeling of building a home, or any structure in Minecraft channels the fun you had with Legos as a kid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway...  I like it.  I feel like the abstract nature of Lego is a perfect physical representation of Minecraft.</p><div class='title'><b>Update : June 18th</b></div><p>As you may have noticed from one of the photos above, I had enough Legos to make an extra head for Steve.  I did not have enough pieces left over to make a body, though, so I saw this as a sign to complete one of those quirky life goals on my bucket list: <b>Go to Legoland to purchase a single Lego piece.</b></p><p>I was in Chicago this weekend, and the suburbs of Chicago have two Lego stores right next to each other.  There's the Lego Store in Woodfield Mall, and the Lego Discovery Center just outside.  Each store has a thing called 'Pick a Brick' where they have bins of multiple colors and sizes of Legos bricks, and you can fill up a bucket with all the pieces you want.  It's generally $10 for 10lbs (if I recall), and the selection is limited for each store.</p><p>The Lego Discovery Center has the exact sized block I needed, but only in Bright Orange.  I went inside the Woodfield Mall, and they didn't have any bricks of that size at all.  BUT!  The trip was still a success.  I was able to purchase my 1x1 brick and create a friend for Steve to play with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Invisible Monsters Remix" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/invisible-monsters-remix">Invisible Monsters Remix</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 13, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Monday, Chuck Palahniuk released his newest book Invisible Monsters Remix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp"  /></p><p>This is an enhanced re-release of his third published novel originally released in 1999.  Despite being his third published, it was actually the first full novel Palahniuk had ever written.  He originally shopped it around to publishers, but they didn't like the characters, and thought the story was over the top.  He wrote Fight Club as a response to their rejections, and it became his first published novel.</p><p>After Fight Club and Survivor, Palahniuk had a successful track record with his publisher, and they gave the go ahead for Invisible Monsters.  It had been years since he had written the book, and he felt disingenuous releasing a full-fledged hardcover edition, so it was only ever released in paperback form. It was his only book to not have a hardcover edition.</p><p>Fans have been requesting and petitioning Chuck for a hardcover version of the book, and this week they finally got it.  And it has a lot more, too.  The original book has 27 chapters of linear story, while Remix has 42 chapters of non-linear story.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp"  /></p><p>Chuck wanted to book to have the feeling of a magazine.  Most magazines break up their articles with the first couple of paragraphs in the front of the book, and dump the rest of the text near the back.  You can start the book anywhere you want.  And if you like what you're reading, continue to the next linear chapter, otherwise just continue to the next numerical chapter.</p><p>After skimming through the book, I noticed that the original Chapter 1 of Invisible Monsters is Chapter 41 in the Remix version, and the final chapter, 27, is now Chapter 21.  The image above is from the end of Chapter 41 in remix.  Even though, Chapter 1 has a nice start of its own, you'd be missing a single chapter in the whole story if you start there.</p><p>Also some chapters have mirrored text for some reason.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp"  /></p><p>In typical geek fashion, I ordered my copy through St. Helens Bookstore, which is Palahniuk's favorite local bookstore.  Leading up to the release of any of his books, he'll sign all copies pre-ordered through that venue.  These are the same types of signatures you can find in the books when he tours around the country promoting them.  But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he only toured to 4 cities, all on the west coast, so these signed books might be more scarce than his others.</p><p>Also, scattered throughout the book is random party glitter, some red stamped kisses, and "postcards from hell" promos for his newest novel, Damned, released last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp"  /></p><p>I look forward to reading this one again.  Especially since I barely remember anything that happened in the book.  His first five novels all seem to follow a predictable formula.  There's always 3 major characters: the narrator, the friend, and the love interest.  There tends to be more character than that, but there's always these 3.  All 3 of them tend to suffer from some kind of mental or physical illness, and eventually one of them dies.</p><p>All 5 of his original novels have them same tone as well.  It's very dark, and gritty, and nihilistic with amazing detail into mundane activities.  Calculative, efficient, and professional, but with a distance from reality and society.  That's what really drew me to Palahniuk in the first place.  His writing style is so visceral and atmospheric that I can lose myself in his story, and place myself in the character.</p><p>Over the years, he's tried to do things a bit different and break away from the molds he created.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I think Rant and Pygmy captured some of his original magic, but some of his other novels have fallen flat with me.  Snuff and Tell-All in particular were ones that I could not relate to at all.  I still haven't read Damned yet. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp"  /></p><p>But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he's up to 15 published books, and he has the two sequels to Damned yet to finish and publish.  He works pretty damn hard.  Each year, he has a new book published, so there's plenty material for his fans.  His website, chuckpalahniuk.net, has monthly writing workshops, so it's not too difficult to get into contact with him, and all of his fanbase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to E3 2012" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/e3-2012">E3 2012</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Each year, all the high profile gaming companies get together in Los Angeles, and showcase all of their upcoming tech and games for the next year, and beyond.  This is E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, and for gamers, it's one of the most exciting times of the year.</p><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from E3 this year.  I was excited, but really had no idea what they were going to show, or what surprises might await.  For some us, the anticipation and excitement of being surprised is just like Christmas.</p><p>Gaming really hasn't been all spectical and fun for the last year.  Every month, another couple of game studios go bankrupt and shut down.  Every month, the larger AAA games being released are more homogeneous.  And the games that were once interesting and fresh, end up being canceled or compromised by the mainstream.  It really feels like the games industry is dying, and grasping on to whatever sales are left.</p><p>All the press conferences of E3 felt like it mirrored that sentiment.  They showed off many sequels, and "announced" many games that we had already seen, and knew were in the pipeline.</p><p>But there were a couple games I'm looking forward to.  All is not lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Watch Dogs</b></div><p>Out of all 5 press conferences, this was the only surprise.  A new game that wasn't leaked ahead of time, and a completely new IP as well.  After showing boring title, after boring title, Ubisoft ended with a vague introduction of how digitally interconnected our society is, and how easily it can be exploited.</p><p>This went into a gameplay video where your character can make use of the digital world to get around hurdles in the physical world.  You can listen to phone conversations, disrupt power, and view personal information about any random person walking around.</p><p>This character eventually gets into a confrontation, and engages in a fire fight.  Even though you have these digital powers, you still need a gun to fight. :(  Then he takes off in a car and drives away.</p><p>Watch Dogs is open world too, and from the content, it seems like you're connected to the mob or some other organization.  So, if you boil all the elements down, it's basically Grand Theft Auto, but with internet powers.  BUT!  It takes place in Chicago!  Plus, it looks really really pretty.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA">Youtube Link</a></p><div class='title'><b>Beyond</b></div><p>Sony began it's conference by showing off Quantic Dream's newest game, Beyond.  Studio lead David Cage took the stage and introduced Beyond's main character, Jodie, played by Ellen Page.  They played a cutscene from the game that displayed the range of emotions and tones that you could expect from the game, and finished off with a sizzle clip of some action sequences.</p><p>I like Quantic Dream quite a bit, even though both Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain had their problems.  I like the idea of interactive story, and being able to change the story based on what I've done.  Both those game have that, but missed a note here or there that broke the suspension of disbelief.  Overall, if you let yourself be immersed into it's direction, and atmosphere it becomes an amazing immersive experience.</p><p>Beyond looks like it continues the story driven gameplay that Heavy Rain set out to do.  People who've played it on the show floor, have said that it is much more interactive than Heavy Rain too.  I'm definitely looking forward to this one.</p><div class='title'><b>The Last of Us</b></div><p>Sony ended it's conference with its other big big title.  The Last of Us is post apocalyptic, and takes place in the crumbling city of Pittsburg Pennslyvania.  You play as Joel, and have your 14 year old daughter, Ellie in tow.  It's a third person survival action game, as you search for food, water, and other supplies while avoiding confrontations, and survival any hostile encounters.</p><p>They showed off a live demo of Joel and Ellie making their way through an apartment building and running into a group of hostile men.  It turns into a fire fight, but you only have so many bullets, and have to make use of the environment, and anything around you to survive.  The confrontation goes back and forth between fists and guns.</p><p>Ellie and Joel react and make comments to the situation, as things happen, which is a mainstay of any Naughty Dog title these days.  Uncharted was so entertaining and engaging because of all the banter between Nathan Drake and his pals.  One previewer said that Ellie acted with complete shock when you, as Joel, lit a moltave cocktail and ignited a random dude, and another guy said that didn't even happen in his demo.</p><p>And Ellie interacts in the fights as well.  If you're in trouble during a fight, she might run up a stab the guy in the back, or throw a brick at someone about to shoot you.  The combat has a lot of variety, and she seems to react with just as much variety, too.</p><p>The environments look gorgeous, and all of their previous games have followed through with an engaging and interesting story.  I'm looking forward to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Castlevania Lords of Shadows : Mirrors of Fate</b></div><p>The first game Nintendo showed off during its 3DS conference was Castlevania.  It's been nearly 4 years since we've a side scrolling portable Castlevania game on the Nintendo platform.  It's been so long that I guess I'm excited no matter how the game actually turns out.</p><p>It's a 2.5D game where you play as multiple character in their rebooted universe.  The style reminds me a lot of the PSP game Castlevania Dracule X Chronicles.  But they really isn't any word if it'll be as open world as the Igarashi games were.  I hope it's open world, but a level based Castlevania with branching paths sounds pretty fun too.</p><p>Castlevania is fun, so I'd probably buy this if I had a 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>New Super Mario Bros. 2</b></div><p>New Super Mario 2 looks pretty fun, too, even though it is just more Mario.  This game is all about coins, and trying to collect 1 million coins throughout the course of the game.  They don't really explain why, though, and the whole concept is rather goofy.  100 coins still give you a 1-up, so you'll be drowning in lives as your progress in the game.  I doubt the difficulty will warrant that many 1-ups.  Plus, isn't Wario supposed to be the money-grubbing character?  Why does Mario need all this capital?</p><p>They announced this game along side New Super Mario Bros. U for the Wii U, which is a completely separate game.  I'm not really sure what their gameplan is when they saturate the market with two nearly identical games.</p><p>I dunno...  I liked New Super Mario on the DS, but didn't like New Super Mario on the Wii, so I think that I'll enjoy this new one for the 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Games</b></div><p>I'll probably buy those 5 games in the future, but there were a couple other games that seemed like they might be fun, but I wouldn't really want to own them.</p><p>The new <b>Tomb Raider</b> looks like it's taking a page out of Uncharted's book, except with worse dialogue and horrible acting.  The whole Uncharted series was based on Tomb Raider, so it feels somewhat odd that originator is now the follower, but whatever.  I'd like to play it.</p><p><b>Assassin's Creed 3</b> looks kinda fun too.  The whole series is about going back in time viewing key moments in history, and now the setting is the American Revolution is the foundation of our country.  I'm interested to see how that fits into something I know a little bit more about rather than Italy, and the other settings.  Also, the ship-based combat looks really pretty, and I love running around in snowy environments.</p><p>The new <b>Need for Speed</b> looks a lot like Burnout Paradise, one of my favorite racing games.  Criterion is behind both games, and as long as it controls more like Burnout Paradise and less like Need for Speed, I think I'll be playing this game quite a bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Huge Disappointments</b></div><p>There was good to be found, amongst all the negativity.  But there were two particular moments of E3 that were absolutely disappointing for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 3</b></div><p>I like Dead Space 1 quite a bit.  It had a wonderful immersive atmosphere that made full use of sound to convey emotion.  There were some points where the environment was so loud, you couldn't hear anything else, and there were points of silence where you begged for something to make a sound.  I was completely immersed through and through, and felt like I was there.</p><p>Dead Space 2 began tearing away at that immersion.  Sound wasn't used as heavily, as it relied on scare tactics and some particularly grotesque and horrorific moments to make up for it.  Ultimately, the whole experience felt cheap.  Dead Space 2 was now a horror action game.  You were no longer immersed in exploration.  Plus, they added a multiplayer mode to the game?  The fuck?</p><p>The Dead Space 3 demo shown during the EA conference makes it seem like they don't even know what made Dead Space unique in the first place.  It's completely co-op, and cover-based now you're fighting other humans.  Your weapons no longer rotate or have secondary fires, and you combine them into new weapons?  No more unique ammo either?  They're basically phoning this one in.</p><p>During the demo sequence Isaac and Harry(?) are fighting a drill that has gone hay-wire, and the whole time Harry is freaking out and screaming, "Oh my god", "Shit", "Fuck".  Does this time even know what terror is?  Having a character forcing his emotions on you is not compelling or immersive, it's fucking annoying.  I would probably try to kill him during the fight just to shut him up.</p><div class='title'><b>Wii U</b></div><p>I came into the conference pretty excited for the Wii U.  My Wii has got quite a bit of use over the last 6 months with Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade, and Rhythm Heaven.  Plus, there's The Last Story coming out in a few months, too.  I wanted to know that these games will look great on the new console, and when it'll come out, and how much it'll cost.  Plus, I wanted to know what games I might want to play on it.</p><p>They showed off the finished version of the console, along with a proper Pro controller perfect for playing games without any gimmicks.  They showed off a whole lot of boring games, along with some Wii U version of games already released for PS3 and 360.  They showed off <b>Pikmin 3</b> which looks fun but not a lot different than Pikmin 2.  And that's it.</p><p>They didn't give a price.  They didn't give a date.  They didn't announce any compelling game experience.   They didn't say anything worthwhile at all.  Why should I buy the Wii U?  They gave me no reason at all.  And that's especially disappointing because before this week, I was excited.  I didn't really need a whole lot of convincing.  I only needed a really great game, and I probably would've bought one.  But Pikmin 3 is not that game, and there's NOTHING else that looks interesting at all.  NOTHING.</p><p>Gamers are supposed to be excited for a new console, and there's nothing compelling or interesting.  Plus, the lineup doesn't have anything from EA or Activision.  The largest 3rd parties have no presence on this console.  So, the only games we'll ever really play on this thing are going to be from Nintendo?  It's going to be the Wii all over again.  It's a complementary console, rather than your main console.</p><p>What a waste...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So, anyways.  The Playstation 3 looks pretty good in the next year.  And the 3DS is starting to build a decent library.  There's plenty of other games that were shown off on the floor for these two platforms that look great such as Sound Shapes, and Unfinished Swan.  Other interesting games have been announced for the USA such as Tokyo Jungle, Code of Princess, and First of the North Star 2.  There's also Bioshock Infinite, and Ni no Kuni coming out too!</p><p>E3 was pretty disappointing but there's lots of random stuff to look forward to.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM T-Shirt 2012" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-tshirts">SPAMM T-Shirt 2012</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 28, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I drew a new design for this year's SPAMM t-shirt.  The theme, as always, was to incorporate the annually elected mascot into the design somehow.  The 2012 mascot were two cats from some anime I've never heard of, or care about.</p><p>This is the first design I've done since 2006, so take a look!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" /></p><p>I think this really incorporates the current state of SPAMM and anime as a whole.  Unfortunately, no one is current SPAMM voted for it, so it did not make it on a t-shirt.  We could make our own, though.</p><p>Also, the design technically isn't finished because it doesn't have a logo, or a title.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>While in college, I was a member and president of the anime club known as SPAMM.  In 2003, we began making yearly t-shirts of our yearly mascot, and for the first 4 years I drew the design for each t-shirt.  Then I graduated, and the club went on without me.</p><p>There's a somewhat growing reverence towards the newer generation of SPAMM kids, and how they have terrible taste in anime, and how they don't give a shit about alumni members, and blah blah blah.  It's all very "get off my lawn" for the most part.</p><p>But anyway, here are my previous SPAMM t-shirt design going back in time.</p><p>For the sake of timeline continuity, it's important to note that SPAMM elections for officers and the mascot are in May.  Then that mascot covers the following school year.</p><p>Also, my drawing style changed a little bit over the years.  I began experimenting with heavier lines, and more ink to show more definition for parts of the subject that weren't showing up well.  This really made things pop and stand up, especially for a simple two tone image.  It began looking a little bit like a black and white comic book.</p><p>I developed this style through these yearly designs, and that's basically where I'm at now.  I don't draw very often, though.</p><div class='title'><b>2006-2007 Year of Mina</b></div><p>I graduated in December 2006, and that final semester was spent in Japan, so I wasn't really even around at all.  This design was really the last creative contribution I had with SPAMM with our movie "completely" wrapped up.</p><p>Mina was our character this year.  She is from the opening sequence of Densha Otoko, a J-Drama about an otaku, anime geek, who stood up for a "hot" girl on a train, he gets her number, and then details everything on the internet while asking for advice from like-minded otaku.</p><p>She only appears in the opening, which pays homage to Daicon IV, an animation produced by a group of nerds in college who would later create and found Gainax, and make Evangelion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2005-2006 Year of Katamari</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy was released in late 2004 in the states, and it was hugely popular amongst the members of SPAMM.  It easily won the vote of mascot for the fully school term.</p><p>For this drawing, I tried to incorporate tons of objects relating to anime, or Japan, or Platteville, or SPAMM in general.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2004-2005 Year of Guvava</b></div><p>On the schedule and showing throughout the entire 2003-2004 school year was <b>Macross 7</b>.  An anime that follows the war between the humans and the protoculture.  It was discovered that the protoculture (or whatever) could be defeated by music, so the band, Fire Bomber, flies around in mechs in space, and defeats the enemy by playing their music over and over again.</p><p>Guvuva is the little furry creature that hangs around the girl character.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2003-2004 Year of Domo-kun</b></div><p>This was the first year we did t-shirts.  Up to this point, I don't think we even had elections for the SPAMM mascot, or entity.  If we did, we never did anything with it.</p><p>After Jason won the election for SPAMM president, he wanted to make t-shirts, so we had a vote for an entity on the t-shirt.  Domo-kun won.  Then I offered to make the t-shirt, or they asked me to make the design.  I was the publicity officer, who was in charge of advertisement, so the basically fell on my role.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Printing</b></div><p>For all these t-shirts, we just used the local screen printing shop in town.  We pre-sold t-shirts for $10 (or was it $5?), then brought all of our stuff there.  I really don't remember how much it cost, or how many we needed to sell to break even.  The treasurer was in charge of all that.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/30">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/28">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
