| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After a brisk day at work on a dreary rainy day, I finally put my Halo 3 disc into the 360 and joined the One Million users online for its first day.  My main goal was to meet up with Justin and play through some Campaign levels.</p><p>So far, my experience with Halo 3 has been nearly identical to my experience with Halo 2..  Exactly the same gameplay as the previous titles, with very subtle graphic improvements.  It's really funny how identical the graphics are.  I mean, the textures are far more detailed, but the models looks the same, the animations look the same.</p><p>Of course, I'm several months late into this news.  Everyone else already experienced and bitched about it when the Beta began.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Halo 3 takes up right after the end of the Halo 2.  Master Chief finally lands after destroying another Halo, and Cortana is still missing in the hands of the enemy.  Another prophet is hell bent on exterminating humanity, and descends on earth.  You begin your assault against this prophet to protect humanity...</p><p>Something like that anyways...  Despite playing through Halo 1 and 2, I really never paid attention to the story.  The actual story portreyed in those games seemed like running from battle to battle.  The action is what really drove the game, and all the back story and plot fell behind for me.</p><p>That.. and I never cared for Halo at all, so I didn't care to pay attention.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Co-op</b></div><p>Well, today is a brand-new day, and once Justin and I got into the same lobby online, we were off into the single player.  Unfortunately, Co-op campaign was just a little bit laggy for me to really get into it.  It wasn't terribly laggy, but just enough for me to notice.  Running side-by-side with Justin was quite entertaining.</p><p>We only played a little bit, since staying up all night to buy the game really didn't give us time to sleep.  After he took off, I played a bit of Solo.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo Player</b></div><p>Solo I found more legible to play.  I actually knew what was going on, and could find my way around without too much trouble.  I could also stop and look at the environment without getting left behind by Justin.. heh.</p><p>Halo 3's beginning is very parallel to the beginning of Halo 2, but without the whole cheesy special effects space battle at the beginning which was quite entertaining.  I love being back on earth, but I haven't gotten to any cities or urban areas yet..</p><p>One thing I did love about Halo 2 was seeing the metropolis off in the distance, gradually traveling closer, and eventually fighting the covenant inside the city..  fighting in buildings, driving warhogs through the streets..  You actually got to battle the aliens on our home turf and showed them we meant business.</p><p>In Halo 3, I'm still on earth, and they're still plenty of aliens to ward away, so hopefully we'll get into urban environments..  then again, it probably doesn't want to copy Gears of Wars too much.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>I didn't want to get too far in the campaign mode without Justin, so I went over to Multiplayer in full expectations of getting my ass kicked and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get completely killed, though.  I was able to pull off a couple wins and gain a few ranks</p><p>Halo 3's leveling system is kinda neat.  You get so much Experience points for your placement in ranked matches, which will determine who you are matched up against to battle.  The matchmaker service does everything for you, and it took me NO time to get into a room and start fighting people.  MUCH MUCH better than Lost Planet, which took me 30 minutes to find a decent room on my own, and then be "matched" up against top-level people when I was just beginning.</p><p>Levels are kinda screwy at the moment since everyone is just starting out, but by next week or the week after, the top-players will really start to distance themselves for the mediocre players, and games should be quite balanced.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Statistical Tracking</b></div><p>Bungie keeps track off ALL Xbox Live ranked matches and will update all your stats online with much more detail than what the game will tell you.</p><p>Here are my awesome stats: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock" title="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock</a></p><p>Whooo...  At the time of this writing, they aren't exactly up to the minute.  I think I'm a private now, after 6 or 7 matches.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Halo 3 is pretty fun so far..  I think its hilarious how Microsoft is marketing this as the biggest multimedia seller of all time, but, as Tony had pointed out, it's not as big as Harry Potter.</p><p>Also, I'm a mere 3 chapters into the story of the game, and there are supposedly a total of 9 chapters..  short, much?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3 Midnight Release" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's a strike for western gaming in the console market.  When Microsoft began treading into Console territory, would anyone had guessed that their IP would be the number one best selling pre-order of all time?</p><p>To mark this event further, Best Buy announced several midnight releases at their stores throughout the country.. One of these stores just happened to be a few blocks away from my house, here in Madison ^_^.</p><p>After watching the season premiere of Heroes, Tony graciously joined me in line in front of Best Buy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" /></p><p>At 9pm, the line really wasn't all that long at all.  Tony and I parked at the end and played some Pacman Vs. on DS.  I was actually surprised that one other person in line actually had a DS, but I wasn't so surprised that most of the other avid Xboxers were tossing around a football and yelling obscenities at each other as loud as they could.  It also didn't surprise me when one of their friends drove on by with Rap music blasting out of their car speakers.</p><p>2 hours went by pretty quickly. After Tony beat me 3 out of 5 matches in Pacman, I tried to write up my Phoenix Wright article but got distracted really easy by Wikipedia and other various pieces of information on the internet.  Apparently Wisconsin has a state fossil..  it's a trilobite.  Minnesota, on the other hand, does not have a state fossil -_-;;</p><p>At 11 o'clock, one of the managers came outside with blue tickets for the Halo 3 inflatable chairs..  It just so happens that Tony and I were at the dead end of receiving the tickets. ^_^.  Hot damn..  Waiting 3 hours in line was just the trick to getting 1 of 25 chairs.</p><p>But these chairs were only given to those who purchased the game, so Tony was 1-up on the other people ahead of us in line who missed their opportunity to grab a ticket.  One lucky fellow, purchased his ticket for a whole $5!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" /></p><p>Now that we were up, I started walking around to get a look at the line.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" /></p><p>When midnight rolled around, it was just about time to get inside..  A few minutes before hand, I went back into the parking lot and got another picture of the line.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" /></p><p>At 11pm, the line extended to a little bit passed the end of the sidewalk, but now the line went all the way back.  Nearly to the entrance of Kohl's.</p><p>At Midnight o'five, we finally got to go into the store..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" /></p><p>Pre-orders to the left, non-pre-orders to the right.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" /></p><p>Just a little more waiting in line, and then Halo 3 was mine.  I missed my opportunity to grab a shirt, but Tony had accidentally gotten 2, so he let me have his extra ^_^.</p><p>After purchasing Halo 3, I redeemed my inflatable chair, and we were off..</p><div class='title'><b>The goods</b></div><p>So...  for $70 and 3 hours of my time, I had gotten the following things:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" /></p><p>Halo 3 Limited Edition, Halo 3 T-shirt, and a Halo 3 Inflatable chair...  which I will probably never open.</p><p>The Halo 3 Limited Edition is amazingly cheap.  The "metal" tin is so delicate and flimsy, I could easily dent the thing.  It's the flimsiest game box I've ever held, honestly..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" /></p><p>Both my game disc and extras disc were jarred free in the game, but did not suffer any damaging scars due to its uncare..  So I should be able to play the game with no problem tomorrow after work.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" /></p><p>Besides the extras disc, it also came with all you see here.  Instruction manuals, advertisements, and a hardcover "art" book, which is really more of a technical details book that lays out all the information about the races, planets and vehicles in Halo.</p><p>meh..  Hopefully the extras disc is worth it..  Right now, I'd almost rather have the regular edition of the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" /></p><p>I took a little peak at the Inflatable Chair, but put it right back into its box.  It might be a pretty fun pool toy ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>Bedtime!</b></div><p>So there you have it..  I have Halo 3, and will be playing it with Justin, tomorrow.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 35W Destruction" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/35w-destruction">35W Destruction</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After toying with what to do this weekend throughout the course of the week, at the last minute, I actually decided to go home.  I really needed to get up to UW-Eau Claire and retrieve my bowling ball, which was in my little brother's possession, and while together, we decided to go the extra couple of driving hours to reach Minneapolis.</p><p>Today on the way, we stopped off in downtown Minneapolis and took a look at something I didn't get around to doing when I was home last time.  I think that was around 2 months ago.</p><p>We took a look at what was left of the 35W bridge that had collapsed into the Mississippi River on that July Thursday evening around 6pm.</p><p>Parallel to the 35W bridge is another bridge about 200 feet away that connects part of the yuppie downtown area to dinkeyville and the UofM on the other side of the river.  We ended up parking a block or two away from the north foot of that bridge in the fraternity sector of campus and begin to make our way south along the bridge overlooking the disaster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" /></p><p>Here's the northern foot of 35W, collapsed into a train yard.  Those two train cars were udderly crushed from the weight of the bridge and its rush hour inhabitants.  Here's a closeup:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" /></p><p>There were two very large chunks of the bridge still left for disposal.  The closest chunk used to lay atop one of the shelves at the base of the river.  When I first saw this chunk, i thought, "jesus.. no wonder this crappy bridge feel apart."

| September 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, my work day was spent using POI HSSF, which can read and write Excel spreadsheets in Java.  You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The new PSP is amazingly light, just like everyone has said.  The buttons have been revamped and feel very very fluid..  The don't feel hard and unresponsive like they do on the original.</p><p>It feels really really good ^_^.</p><p>There's actually a slight difference in the screens..  but only slight.  Tony and I powered up both PSPs and set them up for comparison.  The new PSP's screen is a bit more crisp, whereas the old PSP's screen is somewhat muddy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" /></p><p>The new PSP is quite nice ^_^..</p><div class='title'><b>Gaming in the upcoming week</b></div><p>However, when the hell am I going to find time to start playing games on it?  Currently, I'm in the middle of 2 games: Oblivion and Phoenix Wright 3.  Since starting Oblivion, I haven't touched Phoenix Wright 3, which is making things difficult.  I want to finish up Phoenix Wright 3 and get it out of the way before Halo 3 comes out next week, but I also want to enjoy Phoenix Wright 3..  I find it somewhat annoying that I'm putting so much emotion stock into Halo 3.....</p><p>Phoenix Wright 3 is a bit better than its previous game, but it's just as boring..  I really only want to progress through the game to the full grasp of story and finish off that series.  I think this weekend, I'm really going to have to power through it, and write my peace on it.</p><p>Getting into Oblivion wasn't the greatest idea either...  I figured that I would just play it for a couple hours and then stop cold turkey because of how crappy it is.. but unfortunately, it is actually better than I thought, and I'm having fun with it ^_^.</p><p>On top of these two games, I want to give Final Fantasy VII a go, and have been waiting to play Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.. but maybe they'll have to wait.  There's a slew of other PSPs games I also want to start playing, too.  Check out my PSP shelf..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" /></p><p>Not bad, huh?  All these games were purchased between $10 and $15, too.  See.. I can still be a cheap ass when the opportunity arises.  There's still a couple PSP games out there that need to drop in price..  like Parappa, Crush, and Innocent Life.</p><p>I'm going to stick to my 2-game policy to prevent myself from burning out.  I must beat Phoenix Wright over the weekend to make way for Halo 3 on Tuesday.  I think when I'm waiting in line for Halo 3, i'll probably play a little more Brain Age 2.</p><p>Anyways, feel free to complain about how much I spend on video games in the comment section. ^_^  I'm going back to Oblivion.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-avalon-los-angeles-240606">Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The last I came across of sasha was back when his CD fundacion was released about 2 years ago.  I figured that he must've been up to something since then.</p><p>Well, he's not touring around, but he did release a CD between now and then.  That would be the title of this article, Sasha @ Avalon so on and so forth.  I wasn't that big a fan of fundacion but Airdrawndagger and Involver are two of my favorite CDs, so i'll give it a chance.</p><div class='title'><b>Limited Edition</b></div><p>No Luck, actually.  This CD is limited to a mere 10,000 copies, and when I searched for it on Amazon, Ebay and Half.com, the cheapest discs were going for $100.  I love Sasha, but with his current trend of music, there was no way I was going to put down that amount of cash for a CD.</p><p>Thank god for Google.  I checked to see where I could find this disc for the cheapest.  A couple places had it for $15 and $20.  Really?!  Oh wait, they're out of stock.  I continued to wade through these cheap out of stock copies, when I came across two sites that said they actually had it in stock..  walmart.com and Bull Moose audio.</p><p>No way.. they probably just forgot to update their inventories.  That didn't stop me though..  at $20 with a possibility of being in stock, why not just order it?  The least that could happen would be your order canceled and money returned.  So I went for it..  I ordered one copy from Walmart, and another from Bull Moose.</p><p>Success!  Both of my orders were processed, shipped, and received!</p><div class='title'><b>Presentation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" /></p><p>The packaging is pretty badass..

Very progressive compared to his previous styles of Involver and pre-Involver.  Sasha's motive for music is to build upon many different layers of sound, which he's been systematic putting into his style ever since learning Abelton Live and going completely digital.</p><p>I don't get his new style, though.  He builds tons of layers, but all the layers eventually blend into each other, with no defintion of melody or sound.  It all sounds the exact same to me and very stands out what-so-ever.  When I listen to his new style, I completely forget I'm even listening to the music.  Later on, I'll check the playlist and realize I've gone through 5 or 6 songs already..  sigh.</p><p>Avalon is quite similar to this style but does break away into melody and definition in a few spots.  The first disc has a couple tracks that are wonderful..  Unlike all the fundacion tracks, I actually start humming them thinking back to the cd. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't enough of these tracks that make me love this cd as a whole.  These tracks are quite soothing, but don't bring the painting into a full composition.</p><p>Not only that, but he suffers a train wreck in the first track of the second cd.  What the hell is up with that?  The only reason this cd is so expensive is because of its rarity..  This is definitely one to download, rather than purchase.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on each individual track:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Salmon Fried Rice" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/salmon-fried-rice">Salmon Fried Rice</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The hint of butter.. the hint of soy sauce.. all wrapped around the superb taste of the divine fish.</p><p>This recipe is extremely basic, but the taste of extraordinary..  Of course, it's the salmon that brings this fantastic taste to the table in the first place.  Unfortunately, it is a very basic bi-product of the salmon, so it's difficult to focus this as the center of your dinner.  Some green beans on the side would act as a brilliant compliment to this outstanding meal.</p><p>Give it a try if you have some $50 fish sitting around the house ^_^.</p><p><em>PS: The images might not show up in an RSS reader because I turned off hot-linking from my site.

A movie that can be engaging, can be captivating, and overall you emotionally invest yourself in from the start.  Whether, you love the characters, love the environment, love the music or any other part of it, you are brought into the world with such force that you tune out everything else.  This movie (or game) becomes part of you.</p><p>With such beauty it brings itself to the absolute climax and you are there riding along side it..  You are there with the characters, with the scene as it unfolds.  and BAM.. it hits you.  That feeling of absolute beauty.  So much beauty fills you.. overflows through you..  so much so, that can't help but shed a tear.</p><p>Pure Happiness ^_^</p><p>That's how I feel every time I watch <b>Princess Mononoke</b>.  That's how I feel when Ashitaka and San return the head to the Dear God, he revives himself, and then falls to his death..  At that split moment, when all the destruction, all the hate, and all the war is whisked away into the air..  The peaceful, raped, and bare land lays still..  until the buds of life begin to grow.  The brown scorched hills begin to breathe green from its soil, as the piano solo starts..</p><p>:sniff:..  it's so beautiful..</p><p>It's hard to hold back your emotions when you realize that life does move on..  With all the sadness, anger, and horror, life will always prevail.</p><p>Oddly enough, wasn't it a decade ago when it first came out in theaters?  :looks it up: .. nope, I'm wrong.  It came out in October 1999 in US theaters.  Heh, that was a good movie date..  I went with both Michelle and Lindsey (co-workers at Toys R Us) to Plymouth Manns theater the day it came out.  However, it did release in Japanese theaters in July of 1997.</p><p>Hopefully, whomever holds the North American rights will release a Blu-ray version of Mononoke in the near future.</p><p>Anyways, aside from <b>Princess Mononoke</b>, there is one other movie that captivates me with so much emotion..  and that is <b>Garden State</b>.  I should really buy myself a copy of that movie.  That's the one with Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  I think there may have been others, but i cannot recall.</p><p>Excellent movies..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rock Band US Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rock-band-us-tour">Rock Band US Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As part of the Rock Band release this holiday season, MTV is rolling trucks around the US promoting the Rock Band atmosphere of the game up on stages.  Rock Band, by the way, is a rhythm game by Harmonix, the creators of Guitar Hero.  Rock Band has 4 "instruments": Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums and Vocals.  Form your own video game Rock Band this christmas season!</p><p>Rock Band seems like it'd be pretty fun in the atmosphere they are presented with this stage and crowds.  You really get to live out your fantasy as a rock legend with your Guitar Hero skills.  However, I don't really see THAT atmosphere transferring to the home what-so-ever.  How is playing with 4 people in the same room with a crowd of a couple people compare against playing by yourself with 3 other friends online?  It can't compare at all.</p><p>Rock Band is a purely social game that can only be played with a dozen people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rock Band Tour hits Milwaukee</b></div><p>Anyways, back on topic..  The Rock Band Tour just kicked off this week, and one of their first destinations was Milwaukee.  These tour dates can be found on Rock Band's website: <a href="http://rockband.com" title="http://rockband.com">http://rockband.com</a>.  The tour dates for Milwaukee are incredibly vague though..</p><p>Thu 9/13 - UW-Milwaukee Campus - TBA<br/>Fri 9/14 - TBA<br/>Sat 9/15 - Best Buy - Location TBA<br/>Sun 9/16 - Best Buy - Location TBA</p><p>O_o..  Way to organize yourself MTV.  With no indication of time or exact place, I decided to make a day of it anyways and got Tony to come with me ^_^.  I called up Jin, a former UW-Platteville student, now UW-Milwaukee student, if he had any more information, and also if he wanted to join us.</p><p>Jin had no idea what I was talking about, "No.. I haven't seen anything around campus advertising it or anything indicating anything at all."  Hmm...</p><p>While at work today, he gave me a phone call to say that he knew someone that had spotted the Rock Band truck on campus, back in the Klotche Center parking lot.  Huzzah!  Information..  It pays to know people all over the place ^_^.   With the location in hand, and the road ahead.. Tony and I left Madison around 4.30p and took off to UW-Milwaukee to check out the Rock Band Tour.</p><div class='title'><b>UW-Milwaukee</b></div><p>Getting to UW-Milwaukee wasn't too bad..  I missed one turn that cost us about 10 minutes, and then finding a parking spot took another 10 minutes.  We got to the Klotzche Center to notice the Rock Band Truck!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" /></p><p>The truck was all locked up though, and the canvas was pulled down..  They were certainly closed, but it seemed ready to open at some point.  I figured they were going to do a night event with fog lamps, lasers..  the whole works!  "Well...  let's go find something to eat and then come back.. maybe they'll be open then."</p><p>Tony and I walked across the Milwaukee campus to find some food.  The whole UW-Milwaukee campus is very cramped together, stuck on 3 main blocks in northern Milwaukee..  like 5 minutes north of downtown Milwaukee.  It has all the college buildings stuck together on a block, and all the residence halls stuck together on a block..  So much college in such a little space, gave me a really weird feeling..  it didn't really feel like an actual University to me.  :shrugs:</p><p>Anyways, after dinner, I gave Jin a call to ask him what he was up to and what his plans were.</p><div class='title'><b>Disappointment</b></div><p>Apparently, the Rock Band thing was going on all day and actually ended around 4 or 5pm..  So we missed it.</p><p>There was so many things wrong with their whole setup in the first place, though.  As Jin pointed out to me, There was absolutely no advertising for this events AT ALL.  It was basically word of mouth which didn't work.  In addition, the Klotzche Center parking was on the far edge of campus behind the building in a parking lot only fit about 20 cars..  as you can see from the photo above.</p><p>Also, according to Jin, all the "roadies" MTV hired to help out with setup and, perhaps, advertising, were mainly hired from madison.  These people got totally trashed the night before hand, and simply stiffed the morning crew.  They didn't even show up, so the few people left had a very rocky morning having the setup everything themselves.</p><p>As these failing factors resulted in poor turnout and an overall failure of the event.  I suppose if they had their act together they probably would have still been open by the time Tony and I arrived.</p><p>Booooooooo.</p><p>Well, i'm sure they'll have far better results when setting up for a Best Buy store..  They'll have paid employees to give a hand..  Plus, as Tony mentioned, Best Buy's will probably have their own Rock Band setup close to launch time, so they'll be plenty of chances to play the game with a crowd nearby and not having to purchase the game.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/67">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/65">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (35)
