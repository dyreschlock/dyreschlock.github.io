| January 12, 2026 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Toga Valley is an area that cuts through the southwestern mountains of modern day Toyama prefecture. </p><p>The whole region of Toyama is known as Gokayama <span class='ja'>五箇山</span>, which was named from the region being divided into five valleys coming down from the mountains. The five valleys are Akao Valley <span class='ja'>赤尾谷</span>, Kaminashi Valley <span class='ja'>上梨谷</span>, Shimonashi Valley <span class='ja'>下梨谷</span>, Otani Valley <span class='ja'>小谷</span>, and Toga Valley <span class='ja'>利賀谷</span>. I talked about the history of Shimonashi Valley little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">post about Hosoo Pass</a>.</p><p>Four of the five valleys follow the Sho River, which comes from the east side of Mt. Haku going directly north into the Sea of Japan. Toga Valley is different because it follows two different rivers. The Toga River comes from further east to join the Sho River at the base of the mountain. It also follows Momose River, which is further east and never joins either. As such, Toga Valley is almost completely cut out from the other four valleys and is far less populous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the river's edge meets the land, the forests begin. The whole area is over 95% deep forest. But, dotted along the cliffsides were several pocketed settlements back in the day with larger clusters up the mountain forming small villages of Toga, Sakagami, and Momosegawa. In 1896, the gun-district system was established which classified the entire Toga Valley as a single municipality, Higashi Tonami-gun Toga Village <span class='ja'>東礪波郡利賀村</span>. The entirety of Toga Village covered 176 square km.</p><p>As its peak in 1947, the overall population of Toga Village was 4663. (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>) Today, it's around 400. It suffered the fastest rate of population decrease in Toyama prefecture in 2010 (-23% in 5 years), and it is one of the most depopulated areas in Japan. Because of that, there are a lot of abandoned buildings, including entire areas which no longer exist today. Last year (summer 2025), I visited the area 4 times because I was interested in the area's old schools.</p><div class='title'><b>History of Toga Schools</b></div><p>The first school built in Toga Village was <b>Shimo-Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>下利賀尋常小学校</span> in 1892. This was 6 years after the Japanese government's executive order of primary education in Japan <span class='ja'>小学校令</span>, which ultimately stated that all children were required to attend and graduate 4 years of elementary school. With Toga Village established in 1896, the school was renamed to <b>Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀尋常小学校</span>.</p><p>Toga's biggest problem was distance. Toga village began where the <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> branched from <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span>. Toga River travels over 40km up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam, which forms a lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. But, Toga Village also included around 10km along Sho River and the 20km stretch of the <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east to its source.</p><p>Every 2-5 kilometers along the rivers was a small settlement. 2km doesn't seem all that far today, but in 1900, there were no paved roads or cars. (Cars only debuted in Japan in 1898!) People in the mountains traveled by foot (or rarely by horse). It was impossible for young students in the distant settlements to make the daily trip to school. This trip was even more impossible in winter when snow falls and blizzards cut off settlements completely from each other. (Not to mention the dangers of wildlife and insect attacks.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" /></a></p><p>To solve the distance education problem, branch schools <span class='ja'>分校</span> were established. These were schools that branched from the main schools to treat students who lived in areas too far or too inconvenient away. They still operated under the jurisdiction of the main school but had their own branch principal and another teacher or two depending on how many students they had. Teachers couldn't be expected to make the daily trip to school either, so they lived in the school in their own living quarters.</p><p>In 1902, the first branch schools were established in <b>Tochihara</b> <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span>, <b>Kitabara</b> <span class='ja'>北原分校</span>, <b>Sennohara</b> <span class='ja'>仙野原分校</span>, and <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>. These were all areas near the base of the mountain. It wasn't for another 30 to 35 years before more branch schools would open to treat students who lived on the top of the mountain with <b>Mizunashi</b> <span class='ja'>水無分校</span> and <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>大勘場分校</span> branch schools, and another 6 winter branch schools would open for students who lived in between. I don't have all the data, so I think other branch schools opened in this time, too.</p><p>Ultimately, these were some of the most reglected areas in Japan for education. They didn't get money to build enough schools to reach all children. Most teachers also considered being stationed in these branch schools as punishment, too, because they'd be completely cut off from their own families. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After World War II, education was restructured. All students were now required to attend 9 years of school. There was 6 years of elementary and 3 years of junior high schools. As the country rebuilt itself, it identified these remote schools as a problem and implemented the Remote Area Education Promotion Act (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95"><span class='ja'>へき地教育振興法</span></a>). More branch schools would be built in remote areas to obtain a near 100% attendance rate for schools. And, each remote branch school would now be given a grade (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A"><span class='ja'>へき地等級</span></a>). The Remote Grade ranged from 1 to 5 and is determined based on the distance from transportation, hospitals, post offices, and grocery stores. It's also determined by the distance from the main school, city center, and board of education. When a teacher is posted at a branch school, their salary would be increased based on the Remote Grade of the school.</p><p>From the educational restructuring in 1947, <b>Toga Junior High School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀中学校</span> would open in the heart of Toga Village. The graduating class was only 17 students. In 1948, branch schools for the junior high opened in <b>Sakagami</b> <span class='ja'>坂上分校</span> and <b>Momosegawa</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川分校</span>. The graduating class grew to 51 students. In 1949, more branch schools opened in <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>奥大勘場分校</span>, <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>, and <b>Shogawa</b> <span class='ja'>庄川分校</span>. The graduating class was now 92 students. Each of these junior high branch schools just used the existing branch schools, which were still used for elementary school students.</p><p>Population in Japan soured in the 1950s from 83.4 million people in 1950 and 93.2 million in 1960 (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population" title="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population">2</a>). However, Toyama Prefecture remained mostly stagnant going from 1 million people in 1950 to 1.03 million in 1960 (<a href="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015" title="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015">3</a>). And Toga Village had began its sharp decline from 4,663 in 1947 to 3,562 in 1950 to 3,038 in 1960 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). </p><p>Throughout the decade, more branch schools would open to cater to those who couldn't make the journey in winter. By 1959, the number of schools in Toga Village was at its peak. There were 21 total elementary schools (1 main school, 11 branch schools, 9 winter schools) (<a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">4</a>), and the 6 junior highs (1 main, 5 branch). <b>Note:</b> Through Internet researching, I could only find 17 elementary schools.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1962, the dormatory at <b>Toga Junior High School</b> was completed. All distant students now lived at school, which closed all junior high services for branch schools. More and more branch schools continued to close throughout the 60s as infrastructure was built. Roads were paved connecting all the settlements and more people owned cars so they could travel easily. They could also plow snow in winter easier which closed a significant amount of winter branch schools.</p><p>Throughout history, the people in Toga have been pretty poor. The mountains were terrible for growing rice, so most people lived off of growing beans and buying food from selling silk and gunpowder. With the country booming, many families abandoned their old homes to move into cities where they could find decent work and make a much better living. This also closed many branch schools as their neighborhoods were vacated.</p><p>This continued into the 70s. Tunnels were built between the mountains connecting each of the valleys, and expanded motorways were built, too, to make daily travel very easy. In 1970, the population of Toga Village shrank to 1,961, and by 1980, it was 1,328 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). In 1983, the graduating class of Toga Junior High School was only 9 students, the lowest to date. (There were 17 students in the class of 1984, though.)</p><p>By the 1990s, most of the branch schools had either closed or left dormant. In 1996, all remaining branch schools were officially closed and the government sold the buildings to whoever wanted them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1998, the above school was built, the <b>Toga All Persons School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀アーパス</span>. This huge building combined both Toga Elementary and Junior High together in a single building. There was also space for community classes, and had room for foreign students to study abroad from their sister city in Greece. Population of Toga was around 1,000 at this point and all students took the bus to school. Some students had an hour commute.</p><p>In 2004, there were municiple mergers across Japan and Toga Village folded into Nanto City which now covered all of Gokayama and the towns and cities creeping into the urban area of Takaoka. Population was 855 at this point. By 2015, there were only 18 total junior high students, and 16 elementary school students.</p><p>In 2024, both elementary and junior high schools combined into a single school called <b>Nanto City Toga School</b> <span class='ja'>南砺市立利賀学舎</span>. At the time, there were only 10 junior high students (among 3 grades) and 13 elementary students (among 6 grades). The graduating class was only 2 students. There was only one 6th grader and zero 2nd graders. (<a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html">5</a> <a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html">6</a>)</p><p>Only 400 people live in Toga today and they're mostly elderly people. Not many young people live out here and there's really no reason. There's lots of construction, but those companies set up temporary housing for their workers in summer. Very few of those workers actually live in Toga. Historically, the area has been poor so there's not much value in living here.</p><p>Here's a full timeline of these events: <a href="/old/v7/toga-valley-timeline" title="/toga-valley-timeline">/toga-valley-timeline</a></p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley Schools, Settlements, and Neighborhoods</b></div><p>Again, Toga Valley begins where the <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span> and <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> join at the base of the mountain. Toga Village contains the first 10km along the Sho River, but the majority of the village follows Toga River up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam Lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. There's also the initial 20km stretch of <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east that runs mostly parallel with the Toga River.</p><p>In 2025, I went to the area 4 times and visited 14 of the old schools and settlements of Toga Valley. Let's look at each of the areas of Toga Valley in order from the base of the moutain.</p><div class='title'><b>Shogawa <span class='ja'>庄川</span></b></div><p>Shogawa is the first area at the base of the mountain, and its the first cluster of homes visited after leaving the flat lands of Nanto and Tonami. There was a branch school in this neighborhood, but it no longer exists today, and I can't seem to find any traces of it. I'm not sure when it was initially built, but it was probably in the 30s.

I did notice that Kamimomose Branch School was a branch of Sakagami Elementary School and not a branch of the main school.

They also have a yearly Photo Rogaining event!</p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley</b></div><p>Overall, I find the area of Toga Valley fascinating. Its an area that seems like people have always struggled with money, food, and population. Only the areas of Momosegawa seemed fertile enough for large rice production, but there were so many other small pockets along the valley that continued to survive. Again, I'm not really sure why people lived so far up the mountain when there wasn't anything there.</p><p>Most settlements, villages, towns, and cities were built and grew from being on the way to the next big village, town, or city. Or people settled in an area that was abundant in some resource. Maybe the settlers of Toga valley were looking for riches in the mountain, but never found any. Or maybe they just wanted to get away and stay away from the rest of Toyama. Either way, once Japan modernized after World War II, families recognized there was no value and left.</p><p>Looking back at the population chart (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>), Toga Valley had a steady population of around 3000 until its spike and peak in World War II. That spike (4,663 people) is a little misleading as it wasn't natural population growth. During World War II, large Japanese cities were routinely fire bombed by the US, and Toyama City was the most devastated in Japan. The US even used it as practice for Hiroshima and Nagasaki launching 4 "pumpkin bombs" that destroyed 99% of the city on August 1st, 1945.</p><p>Many people moved their families into the mountains to avoid these bombings and this created a population spike in rural Japan. After the war and Japan was rebuilding, there were so many new jobs available in the cities, and neighborhoods were being rebuilt. There was no reason to live in the mountains anymore, and it was probably even sabotage if you stayed.</p><p>Even so, the old guard continues to hold their old homes in the mountain valley with seemingly no real hope for the future. Maybe once the tunnel opens it'll bring more people to Toga, and they could focus on more camping and leisure outdoor activities, like mountaineering and river fishing. I don't think Toga will ever fully go away when Toga Valley's nature looks so great.</p><p>All of the schools and abandoned villages I visited have been collected into singular posts. They were all linked throughout this post, but they have also been collected at this keyword: <a href="/keyword/toga" title="/keyword/toga">keyword/toga</a>. After researching everything, there are a few more new places I want to visit, and double check on a few old ones, so I expect that keyword to grow a little in the future. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mukodaira Observation Deck 向田平展望台" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mukodaira-observation-deck">Mukodaira Observation Deck 向田平展望台</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

On average, the temperature is about 5 degrees higher in Takayama in winter making it more comfortable.</p><p>I always imagined the shape of Takayama like a dish, flat with curved edges.

You can see some of Takayama's schools, hotels, the southside grocery store, and Takayama's only porn store still in business somehow.</p><p>Despite living here for 13 years, I did not know of this vantage point until I was searching around on Google Maps and noticed it. Getting there is a little tricky, though. In this area of town, there's a small road between the two houses in the bottom photo. Just follow that road up into the mountain. It takes about 10 minutes to reach an area to park. From there, it's a quick 5 minute walk to the observation deck.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can even see the observation deck in the photo on top of the short mountain. There's nothing else up here, though. There's no shrine or temple. Most mountains have a shrine or marker at the top for a local diety, but here there's nothing. The observation deck feels like an afterthought after plowing through the mountain to make towers for powerlines.</p><p>At the base of the mountain, though, is Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine. Some of the shrine members were clearing snow from the walkways and setting up for a bonfire in the evening.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On a clear day, Mukodaira is a fun quick trip to see the town from a different point of view.

After its release in January 2021, it became one of Lego's highest selling boutique sets of all time. It was a watershed moment where so many people were reintroduced to Lego and experienced how brilliant and clever their model design had become in recent years.</p><p>I bought <a href="/old/v7/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree">the bonsai tree</a> around 2 1/2 years ago, and it has steadily gotten me into buying more Lego sets to complement it. With the bonsai tree's popularity, Lego has continued to release more and more botanical sets. In August 2025, they released a new set of Lego bonsai trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Mini Bonsai Tree Collection. It was released in August 2025 for $65, a $15 increase from the original Bonsai set. This was around 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> for me. Ultimately, I try to avoid buying Lego these days because I can buy a lot of other things (toys) for 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> that won't just sit on my shelf. I could almost buy two full games for this price!</p><p>Leading into Christmas, Amazon had the set on sale for 6000<span class='ja'>円</span> and after building the <a href="/old/v7/lego-gameboy" title="/lego-gameboy">Lego Gameboy</a>, I wanted to add a little bit more flourish to the display on my shelf. So, I bought it. And then I also bought an LED light kit for it. (I always upsell myself on sets.)</p><p>The designers at Lego continue to impress with these trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They continue to be creative about reusing speciality pieces in new and unique ways. The original bonsai tree used pink frogs for cherry blossom leaves. The new ginko tree uses butterflies recolored light orange for leaves. The pine tree uses recolored green claws as needles. And the wisteria uses a gradient of combined flower pieces for its weeping flowers.</p><p>The building experience is also amazing. They reused the sloping technique from the original bonsai tree, so the trees stand at an angle. Each limb that branches from the trunk can be rotated and moved to create the exact density of foilage you want. Even though each pot is the same, they can be interchanged on the stands giving you the freedom to create whatever scene you'd like.</p><p>When looking at the trees from a certain angle, they look quite stunning.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" /></a></p><p>However, as other reviewers have noted, when looking directly from the top, the models aren't so flattering. This is especially the case for the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5641.webp">black pine tree</a>. The leaves and needles only form a perimeter on the outside. Inside, there's nothing. It looks bad, but depending on how you display them, it probably doesn't matter.</p><p>Speaking of which, with these models complete, I could add them to my Gameboy display.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Great. :) I wanted to use the mini bonsai trees to add more color variety and density to the display, and they achieved both of those goals. It looks much better and more balanced now. (Although, the bonsai trees don't match the scale.)</p><p>But! There was still something missing. I bought a light kit for the Gameboy and when the whole scene is illuminated, these new trees don't do anything. All the focus is on the Gameboy. It's the centerpiece so, of course, it should stand out the most. But it shouldn't be the only thing that stands out.</p><p>So, I bought a light kit from Lightailing. I like their sets because they use custom LED Lego studs rather than adhesive strips of LEDs or singular LEDs you need to place inside of pieces. LED Lego studs are idiot proof and non-destructive.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lights do an excellent job of creating a mood rather than putting a spotlight on themselves. The ginko tree lights look amazing because the yellow glow isn't over powering. The green and purple lights look okay, but they do not complement each other. Too much contrast.</p><p>Construction was a bit annoying. My hands were too dry so I could not get a solid grip on the wires to guide them in the right spots. Also, the lights for each of the trees are connected together, rather than having separate lines. This means that you can't completely separate the trees from each other, and there is very little slack. The ginko tree and the wisteria tree are currently at their max distance apart. They can barely move without pulling the other.</p><p>Overall, they create the scene I was hoping for. Even by themselves, the trees and lights look great. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I wouldn't recommend anyone spend $65 on these Legos, but I don't think many people did. Again, I bought them on sale for 6000<span class='ja'>円</span> leading into Christmas, which is about $40. I think they're worth it if you can find them for cheap.</p><p>Here are the instruction manuals for each of the trees if you want to take a look at piece usage.<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/138Onp3JYaeLmf0kAM5QvharKVCsFwa4M/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/138Onp3JYaeLmf0kAM5QvharKVCsFwa4M/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ Ginko Instructions.pdf</a><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvrpOH2Y_5Wi1RrnhXxmCMgbgJMZTJ__/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvrpOH2Y_5Wi1RrnhXxmCMgbgJMZTJ__/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ Black Pine Instructions.pdf</a><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u6Mtou_09570WxV4FUPkqiScZylIkFD8/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u6Mtou_09570WxV4FUPkqiScZylIkFD8/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ Wisteria Instructions.pdf</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ome Showa Goods Museum 昭和レトロ商品博物館" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ome-showa-goods-museum">Ome Showa Goods Museum 昭和レトロ商品博物館</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I think the Showa period of Japan is fun to research and peruse as it contains so many building blocks that have morphed into today's capitolistic society. How were products advertised to people 60 years ago? What sort of products were people buying back then? It's interesting how something so sophisticated and advanced back then is mostly trash and garbage today.</p><p>The Showa Goods Museum <span class='ja'>昭和レトロ商品博物館</span> in Ome (west west Tokyo) focuses on the commercialism of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. It's not a very big museum, like other retro museums I have visited. There's only one main room, and it was lined with displays cases that focused on different categories of products, such as stationery, toiletries, medicine, cigarettes, coca-cola, games, and sweets. The entrance had display cases with candy, soda, and cameras.</p><p>After looking through all of the cases, I think my favorite product was a pair of upscale fancy face masks. I love the design of the man and woman on the cover of the box. In the 50s, this style was probably considered peak fashion. But now the colors have faded, the box is rotted and tore, and the mask looks like its about to fall apart. It's a real metaphor of fashion through the passage of time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Their replica movie poster paintings were their most prized possessions, though. Or maybe they were restored originals? They had a recent photo that showed a man painting them. (I did not read the fine print.) These posters were incredibly vivid and striking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, they had an exhibition room which focused on the Japanese folk tale, Yuki-Onna <span class='ja'>雪おんな</span>, literally translated as Snow Woman. There were diorama displays showing each of the key scenes from the tale, various copies of books that reprinted the tale, photos of an author, and some inspired art.</p><p>Almost all Japanese folktales, including Yuki-Onna, originated hundreds of years ago, so I don't think it really fit with the Showa theme. However, it is one of more popular tales and authors in the early 1900s (before Showa) wrote the modern version of it. Maybe it was super popular in Showa times.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Entry for the Showa Goods Museum was only 350<span class='ja'>円</span>, but you could buy a 500<span class='ja'>円</span> combination tickets for another museum just down the block, the Showa Gentou-kan <span class='ja'>昭和幻燈館</span>. Gentou basically means a slide as part of slide projection. The front face of the store sold headshots of many actors and actresses of the 60s and 70s.</p><p>The main part of Gentou-kan was a showcase all of this cat artwork, and the best part about the displays were the parody Kanban signs. I got photos of all sixteen of them.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the shop only had one small piece of merch connected to the signs. It was the Bread Kanban Sign, but they went a step further than the original by changing <span class='ja'>パン</span> (bread) to <span class='ja'>ニャン</span> (meow). I probably should've bought it, but I refrained.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall it was a cute museum, but it seemed far away from everything else. I don't think it'd be worth the trip on its own. But, if you were already in the area, I think the small 350<span class='ja'>円</span> entry fee is an easy sell.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kudou-teruhi-art-museum">Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.</p><p>I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum <span class='ja'>工藤耀日美術館</span> is such a location.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span> is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. </p><p>Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.</p><p>Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District <span class='ja'>須玉町小尾</span> part of Hokuto City <span class='ja'>北杜市</span>. When Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village <span class='ja'>増富村</span>. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town <span class='ja'>須玉町</span> with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.</p><p>Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.</p><p>Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.</p><p>Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. </p><p>He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤賢司</span>, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.</p><p>It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.</p><p>It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."</p><p>In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp">Michael Jackson</a>, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.</p><p>This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Entry was 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> and each book was 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. </p><p>I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.</p><p>This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.</p><p>While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane-in-2025">Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.</p><p>After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">I visited in 2013</a>, and both buildings were still standing. <a href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane">I visited again in 2015</a>, and the Junior High had been demolished.</p><p>It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp">the nearby construction sign</a>, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.</p><p>I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. </p><p>Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.</p><p>In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.</p><p>I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.</p><p>Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wind Castle Shuttered" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered">Wind Castle Shuttered</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

From this vantage point, you could notice anyone coming down the mountain into the city. Likewise from the other direction, you have a full view of Toyama and nearly all its neighborhoods shielded by the surrounding mountains.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I first visited the Wind Castle <a href="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle" title="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle">2 years ago</a> never even knowing it had been since the 80s or 90s. Although, in reality, it's not really all that easy to see unless you know what you're looking for. The castle tower isn't really that tall and its aluminum shimmer blends into the sky and the trees.</p><p>It's also not all that convenient to get to from Hwy 41 either. You either go further north than is necessary, or you take a narrow windy road straight to it. Once you arrive in Sakurayama Forest Park, it's another 450 steps up the castle trail to the peak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a pretty landmark, but it seems like it has been closed for good. Even when visiting 2 years ago, a lot of the paint was chipping away, and molding holding the thick bottled glass tiles was peeling. Now, several of the glass tiles have cracked, broke open, or broke free of their mold. The metal deck also bends under the weight of my steps. It doesn't really feel safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not really sure where this extra damage came from. There were some tiles missing before, but everything still seemed safe. Perhaps the New Years earthquake of 2024 knocked a lot more of this stuff loose. There's not a lot of money to go around these days, so the city probably thought it was easier to shutter the attraction, rather than pour money into the necessary renovations.</p><p>Throughout the year, Toyama would illuminate the castle in the evening, and the controls for the illumination were inside the room on the observation deck. The leading doors were locked, but the door on the farther side had been pulled open. The wooden edge of the door has disintergrated, <a href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered" title="/wind-castle-shuttered">pulling itself away from the hinges</a>. Another door had already been boarded shut, probably having suffered the same fate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside was a phone, speaker amplifier, and a bunch of dials and do-dads.

The weather always seems to change a bit in the mountains obscuring them from view. I had a rare opportunity to take some photos.</p><p>This was also true on my way to the Wind Castle coming from the city.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4170_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I am curious about the future plans for the Wind Castle. No one is putting money into any public attractions these days, especially in rural areas. I would imagine most of that money is going into infrastrcture, repairing roads and making new tunnels. I doubt it'll ever be repaired. Also, removing it might be costly, too.</p><p>We shall see.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Himi Showa Hall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/himi-showa-hall">Himi Showa Hall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This goes in line with the NES replica released a few years ago, and a few other attempts at nostalic video game replicas, like the Atari 2600 and the Pac-man Arcade unit.</p><p>I was initially turned off by this announcement. I don't have a lot of nostalgia for the original Gameboy. And, while building Lego models is always fun, these larger models are expensive, take up space, and in this case, it doesn't really match the other Lego models on my shelf. It's a 60$ shelf piece, and that money would be better spent on actual video games.</p><p>Well, I changed my mind.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The price on the set came down leading into Black Friday. It actually does kinda fit with my botanical decour since it is another life-sized model. And Natalie the Nerd announced that she was making a conversion kit to turn the Lego model into an actual working Gameboy. Because of the Analogue Pocket, I don't need a working Gameboy, but the idea of putting it together sounds really interesting. I want to try it, even though it will be expensive and I'll never use it.</p><p>So, I bought the model. And I bought a light kit, going further away from my excuse of the cost. I also bought a few other things to make another modification on the model.</p><div class='title'><b>The Build</b></div><p>Building the Lego Gameboy is an incredible experience. So many of the components fit together sideways, backwards, and upside-down to create enough space inside the model for the buttons and D-pad to work, as well as match the near exact dimension of a real Gameboy. Various blocks also represent the PCB and other electrical internal components covered by the outer shell in the end.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>So much care is put into the building experience. I think its easy to look at a Lego model and judge it based on its appearance, but there is often so much more to a Lego model. Putting it together can often show how much care the designer took in their planning and understanding of the subject.</p><p>Beyond that, being able to hold the Lego Gameboy, touch the buttons, and play with it adds so much to the model. It's not as heavy as the original, and the studs on the D-pad are terrible, but after an incredible building experience, it feels like you've created something complete and workable.</p><p>Being to go a step further in the future to make it actually workable will bring further life to the experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it does its best to match the dimensions and size of the original Gameboy, it still looks like Lego in the end from all the seams. Unfortunately, there's no real way to fix any of this. And really, the design team already did their best to hide as many seams as possible. This set includes several new pieces and new colored pieces to make it as lifelike as possible. If you think they should have done more, may as well just buy a replacement shell at that point.</p><div class='title'><b>The Buttons</b></div><p>One of the new colored pieces were used for the buttons. It is a mini-figure hat element recolored in magenta. Since I've been doing a bunch of console modding recently, I wanted to try the buttons in different colors, and there's only one other color available.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is Kingsley Shacklebolt from Series 2 of the Harry Potter mini-figure series. Perhaps, it is an unremarkable figure of someone I have never heard of. Was he in the main series? Or Fantastic Beasts? Anyways, the Lego Gameboy buttons are a recolored version of his hat.</p><p>I took apart the model a little bit, and installed the blue buttons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It looks okay. They feel and operate much smoother than the magenta buttons for some reason, but the look is off. As much as I wanted to make my Lego Gameboy unique, the colors make it look like a knockoff. It kinda looks like a Watara Supervision. So, I put the magenta buttons back in.</p><p>One of the best things about Lego is being able to customize your builds however you like. Unfortunately, because so many of these pieces are unique and have unique prints on them, this is really the best you can do. You could also change the D-pad to a different color and use black start and select buttons, but I don't think any of those would improve the model. If they release a cross piece without studs, that would be an excellent upgrade.</p><p>Because playing around with the buttons felt way better, when Natalie releases her conversion kit, I may end up using one or both of them.</p><div class='title'><b>The Lights</b></div><p>Aliexpress had a Lego Gameboy light kit for $3! Although that price was for new members only. The actual price ended up being 1700<span class='ja'>円</span>. A bit expensive for a few LEDs, but I thought that I could use the light later with Natalie's LCD screen. (probably not)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The kit came with some Legos to modify the stands and a few raw LEDs. It also came with no instructions. You are meant to go to YouTube and watch a video of someone putting it together. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g" title="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g">This is the video.</a> It is often difficult to see exactly what it going on because of the black pieces.</p><p>Installing the screen LED is easy, though. You just open up a path along the back and stick the LED strip along the base of the screen behind the inlay. You replace the holding bar with a small pipe piece which I think holds the inlay in place much better anyway. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can barely see the pipe's shadow in the upper right corner.</p><p>The screen LED was the whole reason I bought the kit, but I decided to put together the stand LED lights, too. Unfortunately, these tiny LEDs are very brittle. I was able to install two of them easily, but <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.webp">I destroyed one of them</a> crimping the piece the wrong way. With a very tiny pair of wire strippers, this could be fixed, but I will ignore it for now.</p><p>Two out of three lights still allows me to create the modifications to the Gameboy's stand.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think this light kit looks exceptional.</p><p>The Lego Gameboy is meant as a display piece so it makes sense to have museum style spotlights on it. The screen LED also has a consistent level orange tone that makes it look like a classic screen light, too. Either Mario and Zelda inlays look great with this mod, but I prefer Zelda. The standard Nintendo scroll doesn't look like great, in my opinion. Tetris would've been best, but getting that license would've been more difficult and expensive.</p><p>Going further, I used some leftover Lego LEDs from my bonsai trees and connected all the USB plugs together to set the Lego Gameboy among my Lego botanical collection. It works as the perfect center piece and the lights really emphasize it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I should get some more Lego spotlights for the rest of the scene. (No no, stop spending money.)</p><div class='title'><b>Incredible</b></div><p>While I'm very adverse to buying more Legos because of the price, the Lego Gameboy exceeds all of my expectations. I felt such incredible joy and accomplishment putting together the model, even though it's ultimately just a display piece (for now).</p><p>In terms of Lego, 60$ really isn't all that much compared to so many other overpriced sets. Even the new Japanese Bonsai sets are way too expensive. However, considering that I could spend that same 60$ (or less) on Death Stranding 2, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Ghosts of Yotei, it seems so foolish to buy this.</p><p>But, I think its an incredible model that was a joy to build, looks authentic, and could become more special in the future thanks to Natalie the Nerd. If you're into video game collectibles, especially Nintendo, I think it's worth a purchase even if you don't care too much about the Gameboy.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025">Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last year's theme focused on Kanamori Nagachika and various locations that were impacted by him. This year, the focus was on trees!</p><p>There are several millenia old trees in Takayama, but Takayama also has a rich history in carpentry and craftsmanship in wood arts. After the area was taken over by Kanamori in the late 1500s, he recognized the unique carpentry skills of the residents and cultivated their ability. Many of the resulting woodwork would be used for buildings throughout Gifu, Nagoya, and Kyoto.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just like last year, the event was hosted at the Takayama City Museum and also just like last year, it was advertised very little. I think the posters at the entrance of the museum were the only indication it was happening. Once again, I didn't hear about it until a local friend sent me a message. Here's the link for information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/">https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my third photo rogaining event. I joined <a href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="/takayama-photo-rogaining">last year's Takayama Rogaining event</a> as my first. Prior, I had never heard of this kind of event before. The etymology of Rogaining comes from the three people who coined the term, Roy, Gail, and Neil, and they first began using the term in the 70s. However, Photo Rogaining isn't all that different from Orienteering which dates back to 1897.</p><p>Overall, it's like a marathon, but you create your own path. 20 or 30 minutes prior to the start of the race, runners or teams of runners are given a map and a list of checkpoints. Runners have no knowledge of this leading up to the start.</p><p>Here were the map and list of checkpoints for this year:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Each checkpoint has a different point value. For each checkpoint you visit, that point value is added to your total. The team or runner with the highest point value wins. Photo Rogaining goes one step further by requiring runner to take photos of the target at each checkpoint. You are meant to recreate the photos listed on the checkpoint sheet.</p><p>Each Orienteering or Rogaining event has a strict time limit, so you must reach the finish line within the time limit while collecting as many checkpoints as possible. The Takayama Photo Rogaining event has a limit of 3 hours. You are deducted 30 points each minute you are late.</p><div class='title'><b>Bonus Points</b></div><p>As an added bonus (or headache), the Takayama Rogaining event adds some extra bonus points. Last year, you could gain an extra bonus point for every photo you took of Kanamori Nagachika's name written out on a sign for a total of 20 bonus points. I didn't quite understand this last year, so I ignored it. Ultimately I lost 2nd place by 4 points. :/</p><p>This year's bonus points were much more cryptic and numerous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Part 1 were the normal <span class='ja'>通常</span> bonus points. At four of the checkpoints (numbers 1, 17, 25, 47), if you took an additional photo matching the ones posted, you could get an extra 5 points each. This was very clear and easy to understand. Find the stuff, and take a photo. Got it!</p><p>Part 2 were the secret <span class='ja'>秘密</span> bonus points. There were 3 different collections of locations that each followed the theme posted on the board. If you went to each of the locations that matched the theme, you would be awarded either 40 or 30 bonus points.</p><p>The three themes were as follows:<br/>Theme 3 - 40 points - 1000<span class='ja'>年の時を見てきた長生きの木</span><br/>Theme 2 - 30 points - 400<span class='ja'>年の時をつなぐ</span>4<span class='ja'>人の飛騨の匠</span><br/>Theme 1 - 30 points - 100<span class='ja'>年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業</span></p><p>At a glance, I just noticed 1000-year-old trees, 400-year-old takumi, and 100-year-old carpenters. At the time, I thought, Yeah, I could correctly translate these to understand them completely. However, I would have no idea which locations would match these descriptions. So, I choose to not focus on them and hope my path would collect these locations.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the time came, we were able to open our maps and start plotting our courses. Having done these events twice now, I have learned that you want to make big swings towards the distant areas first, and clean up the points near the finish at the end. If you spend too much time getting all the near points at the beginning, you may not have enough time to get the high valued places further out.</p><p>This year's far out locations were nearly the same as last year's. So my plan was to grab a few near checkpoints while heading further west to Hida no Sato and the Shingu neighborhood. From Shingu, head directly north to the Kumano Shrine, which <a href="/old/v7/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter" title="/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter">I visited back in February</a>.

It's like the opposite feeling after completing a marathon. In both cases, poor training can result in poor times, but for Rogaining, there's always the worry of whether or not you are following the optimal path for your ability.</p><p>Anyways, I was only able to do two Rogaining events this year. I signed up for a third, but it was held only two days after this Takayama event. My legs were ruined the whole weekend, so it was impossible for me to join. I spent the rest of the weekend building that Lego Gameboy. (They sent me a map, though, so I could mentally practice.)</p><p>I'll try to do more next year! Maybe this time I will have the proper motivation to train for them. :)<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
