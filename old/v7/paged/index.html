| December 23, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Japan is a country full of pockets within its dense urban centers and rural country. Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.</p><p>I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum <span class='ja'>工藤耀日美術館</span> is such a location.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span> is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. </p><p>Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.</p><p>Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District <span class='ja'>須玉町小尾</span> part of Hokuto City <span class='ja'>北杜市</span>. When Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village <span class='ja'>増富村</span>. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town <span class='ja'>須玉町</span> with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.</p><p>Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.</p><p>Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.</p><p>Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. </p><p>He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤賢司</span>, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.</p><p>It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.</p><p>It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."</p><p>In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp">Michael Jackson</a>, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.</p><p>This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Entry was 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> and each book was 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. </p><p>I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.</p><p>This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.</p><p>While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane-in-2025">Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.</p><p>After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">I visited in 2013</a>, and both buildings were still standing. <a href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane">I visited again in 2015</a>, and the Junior High had been demolished.</p><p>It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp">the nearby construction sign</a>, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.</p><p>I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. </p><p>Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.</p><p>In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.</p><p>I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.</p><p>Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wind Castle Shuttered" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered">Wind Castle Shuttered</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

From this vantage point, you could notice anyone coming down the mountain into the city. Likewise from the other direction, you have a full view of Toyama and nearly all its neighborhoods shielded by the surrounding mountains.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I first visited the Wind Castle <a href="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle" title="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle">2 years ago</a> never even knowing it had been since the 80s or 90s. Although, in reality, it's not really all that easy to see unless you know what you're looking for. The castle tower isn't really that tall and its aluminum shimmer blends into the sky and the trees.</p><p>It's also not all that convenient to get to from Hwy 41 either. You either go further north than is necessary, or you take a narrow windy road straight to it. Once you arrive in Sakurayama Forest Park, it's another 450 steps up the castle trail to the peak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a pretty landmark, but it seems like it has been closed for good. Even when visiting 2 years ago, a lot of the paint was chipping away, and molding holding the thick bottled glass tiles was peeling. Now, several of the glass tiles have cracked, broke open, or broke free of their mold. The metal deck also bends under the weight of my steps. It doesn't really feel safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not really sure where this extra damage came from. There were some tiles missing before, but everything still seemed safe. Perhaps the New Years earthquake of 2024 knocked a lot more of this stuff loose. There's not a lot of money to go around these days, so the city probably thought it was easier to shutter the attraction, rather than pour money into the necessary renovations.</p><p>Throughout the year, Toyama would illuminate the castle in the evening, and the controls for the illumination were inside the room on the observation deck. The leading doors were locked, but the door on the farther side had been pulled open. The wooden edge of the door has disintergrated, <a href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered" title="/wind-castle-shuttered">pulling itself away from the hinges</a>. Another door had already been boarded shut, probably having suffered the same fate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside was a phone, speaker amplifier, and a bunch of dials and do-dads.

No one is putting money into any public attractions these days, especially in rural areas. I would imagine most of that money is going into infrastrcture, repairing roads and making new tunnels. I doubt it'll ever be repaired. Also, removing it might be costly, too.</p><p>We shall see.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Himi Showa Hall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/himi-showa-hall">Himi Showa Hall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This goes in line with the NES replica released a few years ago, and a few other attempts at nostalic video game replicas, like the Atari 2600 and the Pac-man Arcade unit.</p><p>I was initially turned off by this announcement. I don't have a lot of nostalgia for the original Gameboy. And, while building Lego models is always fun, these larger models are expensive, take up space, and in this case, it doesn't really match the other Lego models on my shelf. It's a 60$ shelf piece, and that money would be better spent on actual video games.</p><p>Well, I changed my mind.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The price on the set came down leading into Black Friday. It actually does kinda fit with my botanical decour since it is another life-sized model. And Natalie the Nerd announced that she was making a conversion kit to turn the Lego model into an actual working Gameboy. Because of the Analogue Pocket, I don't need a working Gameboy, but the idea of putting it together sounds really interesting. I want to try it, even though it will be expensive and I'll never use it.</p><p>So, I bought the model. And I bought a light kit, going further away from my excuse of the cost. I also bought a few other things to make another modification on the model.</p><div class='title'><b>The Build</b></div><p>Building the Lego Gameboy is an incredible experience. So many of the components fit together sideways, backwards, and upside-down to create enough space inside the model for the buttons and D-pad to work, as well as match the near exact dimension of a real Gameboy. Various blocks also represent the PCB and other electrical internal components covered by the outer shell in the end.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>So much care is put into the building experience. I think its easy to look at a Lego model and judge it based on its appearance, but there is often so much more to a Lego model. Putting it together can often show how much care the designer took in their planning and understanding of the subject.</p><p>Beyond that, being able to hold the Lego Gameboy, touch the buttons, and play with it adds so much to the model. It's not as heavy as the original, and the studs on the D-pad are terrible, but after an incredible building experience, it feels like you've created something complete and workable.</p><p>Being to go a step further in the future to make it actually workable will bring further life to the experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it does its best to match the dimensions and size of the original Gameboy, it still looks like Lego in the end from all the seams. Unfortunately, there's no real way to fix any of this. And really, the design team already did their best to hide as many seams as possible. This set includes several new pieces and new colored pieces to make it as lifelike as possible. If you think they should have done more, may as well just buy a replacement shell at that point.</p><div class='title'><b>The Buttons</b></div><p>One of the new colored pieces were used for the buttons. It is a mini-figure hat element recolored in magenta. Since I've been doing a bunch of console modding recently, I wanted to try the buttons in different colors, and there's only one other color available.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is Kingsley Shacklebolt from Series 2 of the Harry Potter mini-figure series. Perhaps, it is an unremarkable figure of someone I have never heard of. Was he in the main series? Or Fantastic Beasts? Anyways, the Lego Gameboy buttons are a recolored version of his hat.</p><p>I took apart the model a little bit, and installed the blue buttons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It looks okay. They feel and operate much smoother than the magenta buttons for some reason, but the look is off. As much as I wanted to make my Lego Gameboy unique, the colors make it look like a knockoff. It kinda looks like a Watara Supervision. So, I put the magenta buttons back in.</p><p>One of the best things about Lego is being able to customize your builds however you like. Unfortunately, because so many of these pieces are unique and have unique prints on them, this is really the best you can do. You could also change the D-pad to a different color and use black start and select buttons, but I don't think any of those would improve the model. If they release a cross piece without studs, that would be an excellent upgrade.</p><p>Because playing around with the buttons felt way better, when Natalie releases her conversion kit, I may end up using one or both of them.</p><div class='title'><b>The Lights</b></div><p>Aliexpress had a Lego Gameboy light kit for $3! Although that price was for new members only. The actual price ended up being 1700<span class='ja'>円</span>. A bit expensive for a few LEDs, but I thought that I could use the light later with Natalie's LCD screen. (probably not)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The kit came with some Legos to modify the stands and a few raw LEDs. It also came with no instructions. You are meant to go to YouTube and watch a video of someone putting it together. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g" title="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g">This is the video.</a> It is often difficult to see exactly what it going on because of the black pieces.</p><p>Installing the screen LED is easy, though. You just open up a path along the back and stick the LED strip along the base of the screen behind the inlay. You replace the holding bar with a small pipe piece which I think holds the inlay in place much better anyway. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can barely see the pipe's shadow in the upper right corner.</p><p>The screen LED was the whole reason I bought the kit, but I decided to put together the stand LED lights, too. Unfortunately, these tiny LEDs are very brittle. I was able to install two of them easily, but <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.webp">I destroyed one of them</a> crimping the piece the wrong way. With a very tiny pair of wire strippers, this could be fixed, but I will ignore it for now.</p><p>Two out of three lights still allows me to create the modifications to the Gameboy's stand.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think this light kit looks exceptional.</p><p>The Lego Gameboy is meant as a display piece so it makes sense to have museum style spotlights on it. The screen LED also has a consistent level orange tone that makes it look like a classic screen light, too. Either Mario and Zelda inlays look great with this mod, but I prefer Zelda. The standard Nintendo scroll doesn't look like great, in my opinion. Tetris would've been best, but getting that license would've been more difficult and expensive.</p><p>Going further, I used some leftover Lego LEDs from my bonsai trees and connected all the USB plugs together to set the Lego Gameboy among my Lego botanical collection. It works as the perfect center piece and the lights really emphasize it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I should get some more Lego spotlights for the rest of the scene. (No no, stop spending money.)</p><div class='title'><b>Incredible</b></div><p>While I'm very adverse to buying more Legos because of the price, the Lego Gameboy exceeds all of my expectations. I felt such incredible joy and accomplishment putting together the model, even though it's ultimately just a display piece (for now).</p><p>In terms of Lego, 60$ really isn't all that much compared to so many other overpriced sets. Even the new Japanese Bonsai sets are way too expensive. However, considering that I could spend that same 60$ (or less) on Death Stranding 2, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Ghosts of Yotei, it seems so foolish to buy this.</p><p>But, I think its an incredible model that was a joy to build, looks authentic, and could become more special in the future thanks to Natalie the Nerd. If you're into video game collectibles, especially Nintendo, I think it's worth a purchase even if you don't care too much about the Gameboy.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining-2025">Takayama Photo Rogaining 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last year's theme focused on Kanamori Nagachika and various locations that were impacted by him. This year, the focus was on trees!</p><p>There are several millenia old trees in Takayama, but Takayama also has a rich history in carpentry and craftsmanship in wood arts. After the area was taken over by Kanamori in the late 1500s, he recognized the unique carpentry skills of the residents and cultivated their ability. Many of the resulting woodwork would be used for buildings throughout Gifu, Nagoya, and Kyoto.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just like last year, the event was hosted at the Takayama City Museum and also just like last year, it was advertised very little. I think the posters at the entrance of the museum were the only indication it was happening. Once again, I didn't hear about it until a local friend sent me a message. Here's the link for information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/">https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my third photo rogaining event. I joined <a href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="/takayama-photo-rogaining">last year's Takayama Rogaining event</a> as my first. Prior, I had never heard of this kind of event before. The etymology of Rogaining comes from the three people who coined the term, Roy, Gail, and Neil, and they first began using the term in the 70s. However, Photo Rogaining isn't all that different from Orienteering which dates back to 1897.</p><p>Overall, it's like a marathon, but you create your own path. 20 or 30 minutes prior to the start of the race, runners or teams of runners are given a map and a list of checkpoints. Runners have no knowledge of this leading up to the start.</p><p>Here were the map and list of checkpoints for this year:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Each checkpoint has a different point value. For each checkpoint you visit, that point value is added to your total. The team or runner with the highest point value wins. Photo Rogaining goes one step further by requiring runner to take photos of the target at each checkpoint. You are meant to recreate the photos listed on the checkpoint sheet.</p><p>Each Orienteering or Rogaining event has a strict time limit, so you must reach the finish line within the time limit while collecting as many checkpoints as possible. The Takayama Photo Rogaining event has a limit of 3 hours. You are deducted 30 points each minute you are late.</p><div class='title'><b>Bonus Points</b></div><p>As an added bonus (or headache), the Takayama Rogaining event adds some extra bonus points. Last year, you could gain an extra bonus point for every photo you took of Kanamori Nagachika's name written out on a sign for a total of 20 bonus points. I didn't quite understand this last year, so I ignored it. Ultimately I lost 2nd place by 4 points. :/</p><p>This year's bonus points were much more cryptic and numerous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Part 1 were the normal <span class='ja'>通常</span> bonus points. At four of the checkpoints (numbers 1, 17, 25, 47), if you took an additional photo matching the ones posted, you could get an extra 5 points each. This was very clear and easy to understand. Find the stuff, and take a photo. Got it!</p><p>Part 2 were the secret <span class='ja'>秘密</span> bonus points. There were 3 different collections of locations that each followed the theme posted on the board. If you went to each of the locations that matched the theme, you would be awarded either 40 or 30 bonus points.</p><p>The three themes were as follows:<br/>Theme 3 - 40 points - 1000<span class='ja'>年の時を見てきた長生きの木</span><br/>Theme 2 - 30 points - 400<span class='ja'>年の時をつなぐ</span>4<span class='ja'>人の飛騨の匠</span><br/>Theme 1 - 30 points - 100<span class='ja'>年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業</span></p><p>At a glance, I just noticed 1000-year-old trees, 400-year-old takumi, and 100-year-old carpenters. At the time, I thought, Yeah, I could correctly translate these to understand them completely. However, I would have no idea which locations would match these descriptions. So, I choose to not focus on them and hope my path would collect these locations.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the time came, we were able to open our maps and start plotting our courses. Having done these events twice now, I have learned that you want to make big swings towards the distant areas first, and clean up the points near the finish at the end. If you spend too much time getting all the near points at the beginning, you may not have enough time to get the high valued places further out.</p><p>This year's far out locations were nearly the same as last year's. So my plan was to grab a few near checkpoints while heading further west to Hida no Sato and the Shingu neighborhood. From Shingu, head directly north to the Kumano Shrine, which <a href="/old/v7/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter" title="/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter">I visited back in February</a>. And then head back downtown to grab any more points I could before the finish.</p><p>My plan was also to not get any checkpoints that required backtracking unless I had the time for it and they were high value.</p><div class='title'><b>Start!</b></div><p>At Noon, the bell was rung and the museum bay doors were open allowing everyone to spill out into the street and start running in their directions.</p><p>I immediately went to the 3 checkpoints clustered together at Nakabashi. First was point 3, the Sakura tree next to the bridge, <span class='ja'>高山市基準木のサクラ</span>. On the other side of the bridge was point 6, <span class='ja'>木鶴大明神像</span>, the statue of Mokkaku Daimei. Going back over the bridge again was point 5, a weeping willow tree, <span class='ja'>高山市保存樹のシダレヤナギ</span>.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0883_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0887_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0889_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>3 → 6 → 5 // (14 points) // 12:04pm</p><p>It was a quick 14 starter points.

From Point 7, I had two options: go south for Point 16 or go west to Points 10 and 14. 24 is greater than 16 and it was the quicker path for further going west.

Decades of video game history have never looked, sounded, and felt better when played on this beautiful device.</p><p>The Analogue Pocket lends itself well to people wanting to customize their gaming experience both inside and outside of the platform. One of the first mods people did with their Pockets was a button swap. After the release of the Pocket and the opening of its FPGA, popularity exploded and many Etsy sellers got to work making their own buttons. I bought two different sets of replacement buttons back in 2023.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The first set was from a seller on eBay who no longer exists. This was recommended by a user on the FPGA discord. The buttons followed the convex concave pattern of an SNES controller, but are made from soft resin. The D-pad is ever so slightly enlarged to prevent wiggling in the Pocket's shell. Because of this, the D-pad and buttons felt so much better than the original ones.</p><p>The second set was from an Etsy store called Cloud Life, which also no longer exists. This store had a lot of different colors available, but I wanted something subtle, yet different. I didn't want any flashy gaudy colors as that would take away from the Pocket's sleek aesthetics. They also accepted custom orders, so I decided to use the Black button set as a base and add two transparent buttons for Y and B.</p><p>After getting everything in Winter 2023 during a trip back to America, I finally did a button swap using the Cloud Life set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The buttons looked really nice, but there were problems in other areas. First, the menu buttons had the wrong grooves. They sent two right buttons, instead of a right and left. Also, the bottom nub on the D-pad was flat, not rounded. This meant that it would usually not register rolling movements on the D-pad. If I pressed down, then right, it would stay down. So, I only did the button replacement, shown above.</p><div class='title'><b>NES D-pad</b></div><p>Recently, someone else on the FPGA discord mentioned something interesting. Apparently the NES D-pad on those Nintendo replica Controller Capsule toys is an exact fit for the Analogue pocket. I bought <a href="/old/v7/nintendo-controller-button-set" title="/nintendo-controller-button-set">a bunch of these last year</a> when they released the second series focusing on Super Nintendo, Gamecube, and N64. I didn't care about the NES and Famicom ones, but I wanted to give this a try.</p><p>Yahoo Auctions had a cheap enough one. It can easily be taken apart with a Phillips head screwdriver.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The user claimed that this D-pad felt so good when playing games. It also fixed his unfortunate problem of triggering false diagonals, a common problem among some Pocket owners. I never had this problem with my Pocket. My only problem was using that Cloud Life replacement D-pad.</p><p>Looking at each of these D-pad, you can see where these problems could occur.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The grey D-pad is a near exact resin mold of the original D-pad. The nub in the middle is rounded, allowing for smooth diagonal movements. The stock D-pad had the same shape. The Cloud Life D-pad on the far right also has this nub, but it is not rounded. This does not allow for smooth diagonal movements, which causes some directions to become locked.</p><p>The NES D-pad looks like the best for rounded movements. It uses a stiff plastic post with a rounded ball in the middle. There are no grooves at all for diagonal movements to get stuck. This is why the NES D-pad felt the better than the stock D-pad for that user.</p><div class='title'><b>Replacement</b></div><p>So, I got to work tearing down my Pocket to install the NES D-pad as its nub's shape was clearly the best out of all my options. There's a great guide on ifixit showing <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396" title="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396">full teardown and button replacement</a> that I always refer to when opening my Pocket.</p><p>The main tool you'll need a T6 screwdriver.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are only five screws you'll need to remove. Four of them are immediately on the back panel of the Pocket, which is the first step of the teardown. You remove those screws and the back panel comes loose. This reveals the battery pack. Unplug the battery, and then remove it from the tabs on the side.</p><p>I have a Gen 1 first release Pocket. Later models have slightly different batteries, but the process is the same.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Before going further, we need to remove the PCB for the shoulder button contacts. There's a tiny plastic tab holding it in place. Pull that back with some tweezers and the board should come loose. Next, we want to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.webp">remove the ribbon cable</a>. Just pop open the gate, and the ribbon can be pulled out. (This is annoying to put back in later.)</p><p>Next, the back panel is only clipped into place. To remove it, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.webp">slightly lift the bottom end of it</a>, and then slide it down. The clips will let go of it, and you can remove it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This leaves us with the back of the Pocket's main PCB. There are four points of contact now. The cables going to the top two speakers must be unplugged. Just open those gates, and pull out the cables. There's another cable going to the power button. Open that gate, and remove the cable. And, the final screw in the middle, which holds the PCB to the front shell.</p><p>The PCB can be lifted from the shell, but there is still a cable from PCB to the front screen. The ifixit instructions say to remove the plug to completely detach the front shell, but I am too nervous to do this step. It's probably completely safe, but I'm too worried about damage. I can reach the buttons easily without having to unplug it.</p><p>I remove my D-pad and put in the NES D-pad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Immediately, I don't like how it looks. The plastic sheen of the NES D-pad doesn't match the matte finish of the Pocket, nor the softness of the Cloud Life buttons. It looks really out of place. Also, the arrows on the D-pad also don't match the Pocket's aesthetics. It's too busy compared with the subtleness of the presentation.</p><p>My main purpose of doing a button replacement is for the presentation. All of the stock components already felt amazing and played great, so I didn't need to do anything if I only cared about usage. Also, the NES D-pad is slightly smaller than the original one. So, it wiggled around even more than before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The user on the FPGA discord was using the D-pad on a White Pocket, so the aesthetics are a bit different. On the Black Pocket, it's too easy to compare black to black and see that things are wrong.</p><div class='title'><b>Cloud Life D-Pad</b></div><p>I like the aesthetics of the Cloud Life D-pad the best, but its square nub prevented the movements.

Taking a left continued up the mountain, and taking a right continued along the edge of the mountain going to some unknown destination. I wonder if there are any abandoned homes or buildings that way. (Actually, the road probably just ends.)</p><p>I went with left path and ascended reaching a road block after 10 minutes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just a few meters down the road, a landslide had covered some of the path. I probably could have driven around or over it, but the real risk is the current part of the road collapsing. According to my notes, the trailhead for the mountain wasn't too far away, so I parked my car and grabbed my camera. I grabbed a bear bell for protection, too. (Although, if a bear showed up, it's not going to care that I have a bell.)</p><p>The trail entrance wasn't too far away. It was around just a few bends of the mountain road. On the edge of one of the bends, was a small, yet clear sign indicating the entrance of the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail left the dirt road and went up into the trees. The trail was completely covered in leaves, but there was a clear break in the trees and twigs which guided me further up and down the side of the mountain.</p><p>About halfway up the trail, it became completely covered in overgrown brush.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From above, it seemed like there was no organization. Once you entered the brush, each direction looked the same. The brush was about as tall as I was, so I had to crouch walk to keep place with the trail.

| November 13, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I bought yet another retro controller. The Pro3 is 8BitDo's latest revision of one of their most popular controller, the SN30, which was based on the Super Nintendo controller. It comes in a few different colors, half of which are based on the Gamecube. I decided on going with the mid to dark gray tone of the original Playstation because I think this looked best when paired with the Super Famicom buttons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While the Pro3's roots are in the retro space, it is very much a modern controller. I think it's interesting how third-party controllers used to be cheap knock-offs, but in the last 5 or 10 years, many gaming peripheral companies are creating controllers that can do more and work better than first-party controllers. They use more precise components that don't degrade over time and still sell them for cheaper.</p><p>The Switch is the best example of this. Switch Joy-Cons are now infamous for developing "drift," sending unintended movements when you're trying to play. Switch Pro controllers also can develop drift, as well as Xbox and Playstation controllers. Modern premium third-party controllers use "hall-effect" style sticks that prevent this drift from happening, including the Pro3 controller.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think it's also interesting how the evolution of 8BitDo's Pro series somewhat mirrors their own development as a company. 8BitDo began as a company selling NES and SNES controllers that worked on original hardware and modern PCs. The SN30 was released in 2018 and the SN30 Pro came a year later, which added the twin sticks. In 2021, they released the Pro2 which aimed to make the controller more modern with ergonomic handles and programmable buttons.</p><p>As their controllers became more and more modern, 8BitDo was expanding their focus from retro only to all modern platforms. In 2022, they released the Ultimate 1, their first controller that primarily targetted modern gaming. Now in 2025, they have brought all the features of their Ultimate controller series back to the Pro.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Initially, I did not care about the Pro3. While I love the Super Nintendo, it's flat-face design puts too much emphasis on nostalgia instead of ergonomics and comfortability. I think the Playstation 5's Dual Sense is the most comfortable controller I've ever used. It fits in my hand perfectly, and all the buttons are close enough and in exact positions that I only have to move my thumb to press something.</p><p>After getting the Pro3, it does feel big and combersome. When I'm gripping the controller and focused on using the sticks for movement, my hands are too down the handle that I need to move them to hit UP or the Y-button. And I really need to move my hand to hit the Start and Select button in the middle. Sure, that's their nostalgic position in the middle, but having those buttons in the corner of the D-pad and the button array is their modern, more convenient position.</p><p>Maybe they should've made some considerations to sacrifice nostalgia. Although, after using it nearly a whole day playing Pokemon on Switch, I didn't have any problems, so maybe my brain is too wired on the Dual Sense.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Pro3 comes with a charging dock and USB-C cable. The charging dock doubles as a wireless receiver as hidden in the base of the dock is a USB-C 2.4ghz dongle. You can remove this dongle and use it on a Mac or Windows or plug this directly into the Switch 2.</p><p>Also hidden in the dock are replacement buttons. The face buttons on the Pro3 are held in place by magnets. You can remove these buttons using the plunger tool and mix-n-max the buttons in any order you want. You can keep the buttons to match the Switch B-A layout, or flip them to fit Windows' A-B layout. You can also replace them with the rainbow buttons matching the Super Famicom layout.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I do like the Pro3 and it is a strict upgrade from using the Dual Shock 4, which I had been using on the Switch and other consoles prior. I like the Dual Shock 4 a lot, but mine is a <a href="/old/v7/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller" title="/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller">custom repair job</a> from a few years ago. It feels rickety from the repair and once or twice the buttons don't work without a power cycle. It is also limited by its bluetooth connection, which requires a USB dongle for the switch. (I'm using the 8BitDo retro receiver.) And also the giant touch pad in the middle acts as the screenshot button.</p><p>The Pro3 feels solid and incredibly well made. Using bluetooth, it connects to the Switch natively without the need of a USB receiver, so it even works in handheld mode. You can go a step further and use the included 2.4ghz receiver, which gives a connection that makes the controller feel just as responsive as a wired connection.</p><p>The Pro3 has now become my universal controller used on Switch, Mister, and other consoles with Bluetooth options.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Z-A Shiny Hunts</b></div><p>While I think having many extra buttons and back paddles on a controller is unnecessary, the biggest boon of the Pro3 is being able to program these buttons to perform macros. And this is particularly helpful with the most recent Pokemon game, Legends Z-A.</p><p>In all Pokemon games, you encounter, catch, and train Pokemon to be the best. However, when they spawn, every Pokemon has a base 1/4096 chance of becoming Shiny, an alternate colored version. These are highly sought after because of their rarity, even though they occasionally look terrible. In recent games, there have been methods which increase your chances of a shiny either through increased odds or increased spawns.</p><p>Legends Z-A has a different method through permanence. As you walk around Luminose City, Pokemon spawn and despawn from a 50m radius around your character. However, if a Pokemon spawns as a shiny, it will stay in memory. Even if it despawns, when it comes into view again, it will be shiny. This means that if your character is running around the world, it is constantly shiny checking Pokemon that will not disappear on their own.</p><p>This is perfect for the Pro3 because you can program infinitely repeating movements for your character as a macro, let the macro run by itself, and come back to the games hours later to find tons of shiny Pokemon (hopefully).</p><div class='title'><b>Macros and Mac Problems</b></div><p>To set macros on the Pro3, you must use 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2. This software is available on ios, macos, pc, and android. You also use this software to update the firmware on the controller and dongle. On Mac, the current version is v1.0.8, but when you update the firmware on the dongle, the dongle becomes stuck in boot mode, so the controller cannot connect to it. (The problem doesn't happen on Windows.)</p><p>I sent an email to 8BitDo's support and they replied with an updated version of the software for Mac. Version 1.0.8 is from Sept 2025, but this one has a date of Oct 2025. Maybe it's a prerelease version of 1.0.9? Anyways, here's a link if you happen to need it: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing">Google Docs/ 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 for mac adapter boot.zip</a>. Using this new version fixes my dongle's boot problem.</p><p>When the controller is connected either through the dongle or a wired USB-C connection, you can click into its Switch settings and create a profile. Profiles can be switched on the fly, so you can set up 4 macros on one profile, and switch to another profile with another 4 macros.</p><p>On Mac, macros are built using controller inputs and refined after. You can't build them by scratch, which I think is possible on Windows. But, it's easier to just record input and mess with them after. Once a macro is built, it must be assigned to one of the 4 extra buttons.</p><div class='title'><b>Froakie</b></div><p>For Froakie, I used the following macro.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" /></a></p><p>Froakie spawns in the middle of Wild Zone 16, which is unlocked after reaching Rank C in the story. This macro is meant to be started after entering Wild Zone 5, though, which is right next to it. After entering Wild Zone 5 from the south, you can fast travel to Wild Zone 5 which puts you right in front of the entrance you just entered. Fast traveling like this rerolls and respawns all Pokemon, so putting this on an infinite loop will do a Froakie check every 20 seconds. It will reroll all surrounding Pokemon, too.</p><p>FYI, these timers are based on Switch 1 load times. Switch 2 would be faster, so you could tweak the times to be more efficient. It's pretty efficient on my Switch 1.</p><p>After setting this up, I sat in my bathtub for about 2 hours. When I returned, I already had a shiny Froakie.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Greninja is an excellent Shiny, plus it has a new Mega evolution.

Psychic and Fairy moves have been very helpful in Pokemon Z-A so far, so I thought Gardevoir would be a good addition to my team.

False Swipe isn't in Z-A, so I'm not sure if Gallade is actually useful, but it's Psychic and Fighting might be good.</p><p>Either way, two Ralts spawn in the overworld in the northwest in a grassy alcove of buildings. When you go in the area, there's a ladder that brings to the roof, right next to a bench. </p><p>At a bench, you can progress time from day to night and night to day. This respawns all Pokemon just like fast traveling, but you don't have to worry about the day-night cycle.

It just holds down and hits the A button a bunch. There's a B button thrown in there in case it accidentally chooses to relax with Pokemon.</p><p>I left this going all day while I was at work and came back to nothing on the first day. Although, there was a shiny Dedenne and Flabebe on other roofs nearby. The next day, I left it going again and I came back to TWO shiny Ralts.

Chandelure and Gardevoir might replace its duties, but it's not a bad idea to have some redundancies. I need to progress to the story to Rank B to unlock the Wild Area that has Fennekin, though.</p><p>Ground is another very useful type in Pokemon Z-A and Mega Garchomp is going to be the best Ground type. Hunting that one is very annoying, though, as it only has a 10% chance of spawning in its area. Apparently, you can do some spawn manipulation to get them spawning 100% of the time. I might take the time to do this.</p><p>So, my team would be Greninja, Gardevoir, Gallade, Delphox, Garchomp, and Chandelure.</p><p>Hmmm...  I don't really have any good defense against Fairy and Water. I need steel and grass moves. I guess I should go after Beldum when I reach that point in the story. For Grass, having a shiny Meganium would be best, but those won't be available until after the story is complete. I think Gallade might have a good Grass move...</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Z-A</b></div><p>Shiny Hunting has been lucrative, but the passive brute force nature of it is not very engaging like it was in Legends Arceus or Pokemon Violet. Also, there is very little variety in the city and the low rez nature of the game makes it quite boring when compared with the open world games I've gone through this year on PS5. Katamari has more variety than this, too.</p><p>Also, I cannot find myself caring about this story. It's neat to see old characters from Pokemon X/Y come back, but the story wasn't all that great back then either, so I don't remember it at all. The last Pokemon story that I actually remember was Pokemon Black/White where the villains thought the idea of "enslaving" Pokemon in balls was cruel, which was an interesting idea.</p><p>The lack of voice acting in Pokemon is really becoming apparent now, too. Every cutscene is endless textboxes with uninspired music in the background. It's sometimes hard to stay awake, let alone pay attention.</p><p>The best part of the game is its new take on the battle system making it more of an arena fighter rather than a turn-by-turn RPG fighter. In my opinion, the most boring part of Pokemon has been fighting. It takes forever, and it's always just a means to an end. While not perfect, this arena-style battling is fresh and pretty fun. I would love to see this refined in future titles.</p><p>But, I think that is the game's only good point. Good = Battling. Bad = Graphics, Art, Music, Story, Characters, Exploration, etc.</p><p>I'm not sure if I'll continue playing much after completing the story and completing the Pokedex. I don't think I will go deep with Shiny hunting the way I had with other titles. I think I'll probably move on to another game or buy that Assassin's Creed DLC.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MemCard Pro for Gamecube" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/memcard-pro-for-gamecube">MemCard Pro for Gamecube</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 7, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Memory cards for video game consoles in the late 90s through 2000s were an absolute necessity as disc-based media replaced traditional cartridges. Consoles didn't have internal storage, so these cards held all your saves. It was great for moving your saves around to a friend's house or using multiple game consoles, but if you played a lot of games, you ended up having A LOT of memory cards.</p><p>There were several third party solutions at the time that offered cards with increased capacity and multiple pages, but they weren't always supported and often weren't as stable as official solutions.</p><p>With retro gaming being so popular, 8BitMods has created a modern day solution to this problem that is incredibly stable. Last year, after putting together a <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2 set up</a>, the <a href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">MemCard Pro2</a> was an essential part. It was one of the most incredible pieces of the set up as I was able to bring all my saves from 25 years ago into the present.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Prior to the MemCard Pro2, the second version of the Memcard was created for the Gamecube, titled the <b>MemCard Pro GC</b>. They are currently working on a fourth version of the Memcard for exclusive use on the Dreamcast, the VMU Pro. I can't wait for that. :)</p><p>The MemCard GC has the same functionality of the PS2 version, complete with WiFi, online memory card page navigation, and Game ID recognition to create unique memory cards for each game. All game saves and information are stored on a micro SD card.</p><p>Because I had planned on <a href="/old/v7/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive">modding my Gamecube with the FlippyDrive</a>, I bought a MemCard Pro GC, which complemented my replacement shell quite well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The standard set up for the MemCard Pro GC is mostly the same as it is for the MemCard Pro2. I wrote about those <a href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">instructions</a> last year. However, transferring saves from old memory cards is a much different process.</p><div class='title'><b>Micro SD Card</b></div><p>In addition to the Memcard, you'll need an SD card. So, how big did you need? </p><p>Memory cards for the Gamecube were released in 512kb, 2mb, and 8mb sizes. The 8mb card had 1019 blocks available for saves. Most games take up between 3 and 20 blocks, so even as the largest, the 8mb card could hold saves for 50 games. 1gb could hold 125 of those big 8mb memory cards, which would be enough for 6250 games on their own. So, 64gb could hold saves for how many games? 400,000. A number far higher than the number of games released on the platform.</p><p>64gb is obviously overkill, but a 64gb micro SD card is less than $10 these days. If you don't have a smaller card lying around, it's not too expensive to get a new one. You'll never have to worry about space again.</p><div class='title'><b>Firmware Set Up</b></div><p>The Memcard wants the SD card formatted in either FAT32 or ExFat. Either is okay, so I went with ExFat. I downloaded the <a href="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public" title="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public">Latest Firmware</a> and copied the files onto the card.</p><p>Someone recommended downloading a previous version and using the web interface to update it to the most recent version, but I had a lot of problems with that. Don't do that! Just download the most recent.</p><div class='title'><b>WiFi Set Up</b></div><p>One of the key features of the MemCard Pro is its web interface.

Phantasy Star Online, F-Zero GX, Pokemon Colosseum, Fire Emblem, and a few others won't allow you to copy saves using the Gamecube. Some of these are simple flags preventing the copy.
