The Tokyo Metro Building in west Shinjuku is one such building known for its twin towers. It was often depicted in classic anime series (particularly CLAMP series) as a source of power. In reality, it's a governmental building which administrates all the city affairs of Shinjuku and surrounding neighborhoods.</p><p>Besides that, the building serves another purpose which attracts quite a few tourists. Its observation deck is one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the whole city. And for free! I've been here several times before, and wrote about it too <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-metropolitan-building" title="/tokyo-metropolitan-building">over 10 years ago</a>.</p><p>I was in Tokyo for school business, and as school business concluded, it was near sunset and I was near the Metro Building. I met up with another teacher and some of our students, and we walked to the building to catch the sunset.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not only was our timing perfect, but because of the completely clear weather we had all weekend, Mt. Fuji was very visible right next to the sun.</p><p>The clear weather also gave a perfect view of that beautiful Tokyo skyline.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>There were a lot of people crowded around the west windows of the observation deck, but it wasn't as crowded as you'd think. I found a spot near a window and kept snapping photos of the sun slowly moving closer and closer to the horizon, until it finally went below the mountains left of Fuji.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0011.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0011.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0011_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0011_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0011_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0036.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0036_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0054.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0054_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0075.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0075_t.webp"/></a></p><p>I had fun staring at the sun. It didn't sustain the interest of my students and the other teacher, though, as they were waiting for me on a couch nearby. They were hungry as their school business of the day was just as long as mine. Also, they were in a bit of hurry since they had tickets for an event at 7pm. We had dinner as fast as we could, then I saw them off in a taxi. </p><p>Contemplating what to do with the rest of my evening, I decided to return to the observation deck and take some night photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last time I visited the Metro Building was in summer with some college friends in Japan on vacation. One night, we went to the Metro Building to watch the nightly <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5247.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5247.webp">projected illumination event</a>, which happens 3 times a day after nightfall. Visualizations were projected on the east side of the Metro building, which pulsed and moved to music. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5618.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5618.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5618_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5618_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_5618_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The visualizations matched the architecture of the building, and sometimes it felt like the building was transformed into a circuit board, or blocks which broke away in a fantasy landscape.</p><p>Now, I was on the reverse side of the projection, looking down at the crowd and the projectors shooting up at me.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0139.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0139_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0139_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0139_t.webp"/></a></p><p>Looks like the projection is done using 28 projectors on the roof of the assembly building, opposite of the 45-story main building.</p><p>Overall, viewing the sunset from an observation point in Tokyo was one of the things on my bucket list (which I had forgotten), so I was glad to end the weekend and my business trip with such a beautiful site. Tomorrow, it's back to the blizzard up in the mountains.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Unicorn Gundam in Odaiba" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/unicorn-gundam-in-odaiba">Unicorn Gundam in Odaiba</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In fact, this is the premiere location of Japan's full-sized Gundams, of which there are 3 now.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Since 2017, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam occupies this spot. This Gundam is from the anime series and novel, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. As I understand it, Gundam Unicorn was a soft reboot or retelling of the original Gundam story. Or maybe a modern side story set during the time of the original. Made in 2010, it was a breath of fresh air and a return to roots for the franchise after countless spinoffs, sequels, and over-saturation.</p><p>The most iconic of gundams is the original RX-78 model, which occupied this space from 2009 to 2016. It was built to celebrate the Gundam franchise's 30th anniversary. People say that it was replaced with the Unicorn Gundam as a symbol of Japan moving into the future, with their bid for the 2020 Olympics.</p><p>The original RX-78 Gundam is still sometimes used for events. It was recently used in front of the Gundam Factory in Yokohama, which closed last year. Now, it might be in Osaka according to Wikipedia. Another full-sized Gundam is in Fukuoka, which was completed in 2020.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After arriving in Tokyo for a business trip, I went to Odaiba to see the Gundam during sunset. The timing ended out working perfectly. :)</p><p>4 times a day, the Gundam performs its transformation sequence. I was able to catch the 5pm one, the last of the day. At night, there was a musical performance, but I wanted to get to my hotel and prepare for the next day.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Photo Collage Page" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/photo-collage-page">Photo Collage Page</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 4, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 25 years, I've been taking photos and displaying them online, here. In fact, displaying my artwork was the original purpose for creating my website in the first place. Over time, the purpose of my website changed. Photography became more important to me than artwork. Then, writing more focused content became more important.</p><p>I continue to take a lot of photos with my digital camera, but those photos are all attached to posts and only viewable at the bottoms of those pages. My writing is always put first.</p><p>So, I've made a page that puts my photos first: the <a href="/photo" title="/photo">Photo Collage Page</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="/photo" title="/photo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250203_photo/Screenshot09.02.45_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From here, you can view all the photos I've marked as important or significant. You can click into them and view the corresponding post if it's available, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Diamond Grid Photos</b></div><p>The photos on the Photo page have been individually selected by me, after sifting through most of the over 20,000 images available on the site. While going through photos, I noticed there were many photo galleries in the directory that didn't have blog posts associated with them. Over time, I will add these posts to the site with the attached images.</p><p>I have already added a few of these posts. In particular, I added 2 major clusters of posts. The first cluster was my 2011 trip to Japan with my brother. We traveled around the Kansai region going to Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and few other cities. The second cluster was my 2014 trip to Okinawa. I visited many war sites and met up with my friend Justin while he was stationed there.</p><p>These posts are all back dated to when they took place. You can find them through the archive page from <a href="/archive/2011/6" title="/archive/2011/6">June 2011</a> and <a href="/archive/2014/7" title="/archive/2014/7">July 2014</a>.</p><p>Because of these past posts, I have now surpassed 1000 blog entries on the site.</p><div class='title'><b>Single Photos</b></div><p>One of the pages I had on a previous version of my site showed off random photos of mine without any real context. These were singular photos that I thought looked nice, so I wanted to those photos on this page too. So, I added a new photo folder on the backend for single photos.</p><p>I still continue to take random photos with my camera or my phone when I'm walking around, so I'll continue to add nice looking photos to the Photo page as time goes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Updates</b></div><p>To match the diamond grid motif, image galleries on posts also have the diamond grid, replacing the original square grid. I might add more 45 degree angles in other places, too, to have more things match. We'll see, though. Keeping things simple around here is still important.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mt.

| February 1, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's weird to think, but this year marks 25 years of having some form of Internet home page. It all started with Geocities as a portfolio showcasing work from art school. Then, my site moved to Tripod where I tried making a web comic. And then to its home here at theschlock.com posting game reviews and photos.</p><p>Lately, I came across some of my old pages, and I wanted to find a way to surface them again. The actual content is too personal (or problematic), so I couldn't surface the pages in their original form, so I decided to reuse the old designs with all the posts currently available on the site. </p><p>Prior to the current version of the site, I would count 8 distinct versions of my home pages over 4 clear eras of experimentation and learning. FYI, not all the links on these pages are available.</p><p><u>Geocities Era</u> / Microsoft Frontpage<br/>Version 0 - <b>Art Portfolio</b> (2000, or 1999?)</p><p><u>Tripod Era</u> / Microsoft Frontpage<br/><a href="/old/v1" title="/old/v1">Version 1</a> - <b>Original Version</b> (June 12th 2000 - April 2002)<br/><a href="/old/v2" title="/old/v2">Version 2</a> - <b>Updated Version</b> (April 2002 - January 2003)</p><p><u>Domain Era</u> / Macromedia Dreamweaver<br/><a href="/old/v3" title="/old/v3">Version 3</a> - <b>Experimental Photo Version</b> (January 2003 - February 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v4" title="/old/v4">Version 4</a> - <b>Clean Photo Version</b> (February 2003 - August 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v5" title="/old/v5">Version 5</a> - <b>Framed Photo Version</b> (August 2003 - June 2005)<br/><a href="/old/v6" title="/old/v6">Version 6</a> - <b>Movable Type</b> (August 2003 - August 2006)</p><p><u>Wordpress Era</u><br/><a href="/old/v7" title="/old/v7">Version 7</a> - <b>Wordpress</b> (August 2006 - March 2014)</p><p><u>Current Era</u><br/><a href="/site-design-history" title="/site-design-history">Version 8</a> - <b>Tapestry / Java</b> (March 2014 - present)</p><div class='title'><b>Origins</b></div><p>The Internet was an absolute marvel to me. Everyone was spreading out on the net and carving their own corner of it for themselves. Everyone had their own website for their art, for their stupid movies, for their forums, for their ideas. I was in art school, so I wanted to be like all the other artists online, showcasing their stuff. Too bad I was a terrible artist.</p><p>I had no idea how to actual make a webpage. I don't remember the details, but it seems like I downloaded Microsoft Frontpage, which generated the code of my original pages, and put together a design based on other pages I liked. Geocities and Tripod offered free hosting, so I put it there and linked to other people's pages.</p><p>Version 0 - <b>Art Portfolio</b> (Geocities, 2000)<br/><a href="/old/v1" title="/old/v1">Version 1</a> - <b>Original Version</b> (June 12th 2000 - April 2002)<br/><a href="/old/v2" title="/old/v2">Version 2</a> - <b>Updated Version</b> (April 2002 - January 2003)</p><p>(Note: I am unable to retrieve any Geocities data at this time, so I'll try to revisit it later.)</p><div class='title'><b>Domain</b></div><p>After art school, I went to a real school and started learning programming. I started meeting more people who also cared about making an online presence for themselves.</p><p>November 2002 was when I bought theschlock.com. Also, for that Christmas, I got my first digital camera, and starting taking tons of photos. I wanted to make a site that used my photography more in its design and showcased photos. I started going to more clubs, and wanted to put those photos online, too. I started thinking about having a multipage design, rather than a single landing page with links.</p><p>I found Macromedia Dreamweaver online which was WAY more user friendly than Frontpage. I could actually edit things in a design view and move them around. It gave me more freedom. This really helped me develop a sense of web-design. I still had yet to fully understand HTML, but Dreamweaver had both design views and code views, so I could watch the code change as I moved things around. After a while, I could take off the training wheels and write the code myself.</p><p><a href="/old/v3" title="/old/v3">Version 3</a> - <b>Experimental Photo Version</b> (January 2003 - February 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v4" title="/old/v4">Version 4</a> - <b>Clean Photo Version</b> (February 2003 - August 2003)<br/><a href="/old/v5" title="/old/v5">Version 5</a> - <b>Framed Photo Version</b> (August 2003 - June 2005)</p><p>I messed around with some designs and eventually landed on the last one. </p><div class='title'><b>Blogs</b></div><p>By the time I landed on that last design, I was living with friends and fellow students who were in web development at school. They also made their own websites, and quite knowledgable about all things Internet. Blogging software started becoming an actual business, and people had begun transitioning from completely custom hobbyist sites into Blogs.</p><p>Technology had changed too. Making website updates was no longer about directly editing HTML and uploading it. The underlying database would hold all the data, and software running on the server would generate the page. I didn't fully understand this. I had really only just grasped the top layer of web-dev.</p><p>One of my friends loved Movable Type, so I installed it on theschlock.com from his recommendation. I used it in tandem with the Framed version of the site. Moveable Type would handle all the long posts about games and whatever. The Framed version was updated with photos and pictorials.</p><p><a href="/old/v6" title="/old/v6">Version 6</a> - <b>Movable Type</b> (August 2003 - August 2006)</p><p>I used this site through the remainder of college.</p><div class='title'><b>Wordpress</b></div><p>Nearing the end of college, the Internet and blogging had matured. My site design was pretty "old" for the Internet and MovableType wasn't totally user-friendly to use. By then, Wordpress completely overtook all of independent blogging. </p><p>Prior to studying abroad in Japan, I downloaded my entire site locally and zipped it. I installed Wordpress on theschlock.com, which completely took over. Wordpress was WAY more user friendly than Movable Type, and I could easily write about everything I was doing in Japan, and show all my photos, too.</p><p><a href="/old/v7" title="/old/v7">Version 7</a> - <b>Wordpress</b> (August 2006 - March 2014)</p><p>I choose the design from a template, but then changed it slightly to be different. Not all that much, though.</p><p>After graduating, I still continued to use it. Working as a developer, I learned so much about using Java to manage and maintain websites, but I never had the headspace to use it on any personal projects. I had the time, but I already spent all day thinking about websites at work. I needed to decompress at home.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Version</b></div><p>That brings us to the current version of the site. </p><p>While Wordpress was far more user-friendly than my previous versions, it didn't feel special. It didn't feel like it was mine. Wordpress used PHP at the time, which I never liked. PHP feel far too loose and I couldn't understand it.</p><p>I had always wanted to remake everything from scratch and have complete control over everything on the site in a more modern capacity. I had started laying some initial groundwork in 2012. But then, after moving to Japan and settling in, I finally had the headspace to execute on my ideas completely. I knew exactly what I wanted and exactly how to make what I wanted.</p><p>I wrote about all this in the first post on this version of the site on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th, 2014</a> as the site went live for the first time. Around 2 months later, the full design was complete. I wrote about that <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start-2" title="/a-fresh-start-2">here</a>.</p><p><a href="/site-design-history" title="/site-design-history">Version 8</a> - <b>Current</b> (March 2014 - now)</p><p>It was the site I had always wanted. I had complete control over everything on the site, and it was extensible enough to have new things over time.</p><p>Running an active website isn't all that easy, though. It was always going down after a couple of days. I kept up with it for nearly 3 years. Then, one day, when I checked on it, the site was gone. Deleted from my host. My host had dropped support, so that was the end of that service.</p><p>2 years ago, with renewed programming interest, I finally brought the site back online, nearly 9 years after its initial launch. I posted about it on <a href="/old/v7/website-revival" title="/website-revival">March 9th 2023</a>.</p><p>Now, the online version of my site is a generated mess of static HTML files. Because of this, there should no longer ever be any problems with hosting in the future. There's nothing running on the host, nor any database it's pulling from. It is free from any technical problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>This design has changed and been refined a little bit over the years, but I doubt there will ever be another complete redesign of the site. The design still holds all the key values I want for written online content, and it's easy for me to add new things and change them.</p><p>Although...  Now that I have a framework for displaying my blogging content with different designs, I could experiment with new designs and see if anything sticks. Or, I could design terrible versions of my site in the same way that much of the blogging sites have turned into.</p><p>Revisiting many of these old pages has given me some new ideas, too, so stay tuned. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Modded Console Game Inventory" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/modded-console-game-inventory">Modded Console Game Inventory</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 23, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Recently I started thinking about the Dreamcast thanks to a recent playthrough of Crazy Taxi from ADGQ. While many of the games have been released and made available on other consoles and platforms throughout the years, there are still several games orphaned on the Dreamcast. Plus, the authentic feel of the playing the game, and hearing the original sounds and music is often not well replicated elsewhere.</p><p>Because of this, and 8bitmods eventual release of their VMU Memcard Pro, I decided to look into Dreamcast mods to determine what it would take to put together a console capable of playing its vast library via hard drive or sd card, similar to the <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2</a> set up I did last year.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, it does not seem difficult at all. Many moderns mods are parts replacement for internal components. You still need to open up the console and take things apart, but you aren't soldering any mod chips or replacing capacitors. You just unplug this component, remove it, and plug in this one instead. Very plug and play. Many of these parts are pretty cheap through AliExpress too!</p><p>Anyways, I ordered a bunch of parts this week. My Dreamcast is back in the states, so even though the parts will arrive over the next two weeks, assembly will have to wait until after summer.</p><p>In the meantime, I can prepare.</p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast GDemu</b></div><p>The main mod used in the Dreamcast is the <b>GDemu</b>. It is a PCB replacement for the entire GD-ROM reader assembly. To install, you need to take out the GD-ROM disc reader, and put this PCB in there instead. The GDemu board has an SD card reader attached to it, and this is where all of the games are stored.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I bought a SanDisk Extreme 128gb card, Class 10. Game are around 1.2gb each, which I thought would be enough space. But, I'm already getting close to the upper limit of space. A 256gb cards would've been better. I might upgrade later.</p><p>Some people online have complained about compatibility, but I think those complaints predate the current version of GDemu. More recent videos and posts have said similar SD cards work just fine for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Format SD Card</b></div><p>The GDemu requires the SD card to be FAT-32 format. One person said that using 64k byte cluster sizes can help with readability, too, so I opted for that. (It probably doesn't matter.) Using Diskutil, Macs will format FAT-32 with a cluster size of 32k bytes. So, for the 64k byte cluster size, you can use the following terminal commands.</p><p><pre>diskutil unmount SD_IDENTIFIER<br/>sudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -c 128 -v VOLUMEID /dev/SD_IDENTIFIER<br/>diskutil mount SD_IDENTIFIER</pre></p><p>The drive must be unmounted first before formatting it, then the <code>newfs_msdos</code> command is used. <code>VOLUMEID</code> is the new name of your SD card, and <code>SD_IDENTIFIER</code> is the identifier used in disk utils.  Check <code>diskutil list</code> for the correct identifier. <code>-F 32</code> is for FAT-32. <code>-c 128</code> is for the 64 byte cluster size.</p><p>(The reasons for 128 with -c is a little complicated. Overall, we want a 64k byte size. In bytes, this is 64x1024 = 65,536 bytes. The SD card has a block size of 512 bytes, so we do 65,536/512, which is 128. This number describes the number of blocks in a cluster.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, our SD card is in the current format. Now, we need games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>To combat piracy, Sega and Yamaha created a new disc format for the Dreamcast called the GD-ROM. GD-ROMs held up to 1gb of information, surpassing the 650mb limits of the CD-ROM. One unique feature of the GD-ROM was that information was "burned" into the CD from the outside in, rather than inside out, like CD-ROMs. Both of these together were expected to make the Dreamcast secure from people burning their own games.</p><p>Within one year after its North American release, this was circumvented. Even though games were on GD-ROMs, the Dreamcast could still read CD-ROMs, so hacker group Utopia created the infamous Utopia disc which forced the Dreamcast to boot in CD-ROM mode. Games could then be burned to CD-ROMs and run nearly identically to the GD-ROMs. Some stuff had to be cut from games to fit into the 650mb CD limit, but many GD-ROMs filled their discs with dummy information anyways.  Much of this dummy information was just pushing the data to the outer edge of the disc.</p><p>Because of this, Dreamcast games can be found online in two main formats: GDI and CDI files. GDI is usually preferred as the CDI version could have cut content to fit into 650mb. Although, the problem with GDI files is that they are always 1.1gb or 1.2gb to simulate the full size of the disc. It's possible to shrink these sizes, cutting out the extra content, but that can still cause some compatibility issues.</p><div class='title'><b>Game Management</b></div><p>Games are copied to the SD card, but the GDemu requires a specific file and folder structure. You also need files for the GD Menu, too.</p><p>I found this amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4">YouTube video</a> from Derek Pascarella fully describing the software-wide of how to set up and manage games for your Dreamcast using the GDemu. Here's that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4">link</a> again. The rest of this post is basically going to parrot this video.</p><p>You will need to download 2 things for Games and Menu management. And there's one more thing to download to edit Boxart and Metadata for games in the menu.</p><p>1) The <a href="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager" title="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager">GD Menu Card Manager</a> is how you will manage all your games<br/>2) <a href="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu" title="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu">Open Menu</a> is the most modern menu used in the Dreamcast to choose your games.<br/>3) The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> for editing boxart and metadata.</p><p>The Open Menu DAT Tool is available through the dreamcast-talk forum, which is member only and a little difficult to gain access. The video has a link to their personal Google Drive for the file. The link above connects to my Google Drive, where I also have a copy.</p><div class='title'><b>GD Menu Card Manager</b></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager" title="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager">GD Menu Card Manager</a> works for both Mac and PC. When you open the program, choose your SD card from the menu. You can choose whether to install GDmenu or Open Menu. Any game you want install, just drag into the window, rename to whatever you want, and hit Save Changes at the bottom.</p><p>Overall, the GDemu wants each disc in its own folder, numbered starting from 01. The 01 folder is special and it must contain the GDemu menu (GDmenu or openMenu). The Card Manager will copy the correct files for you. From 02, each folder is for a game disc. Again, the Card Manager will manage all these folders for you. When adding new games, you can have them alphabetically sorted, and the Manager will rearrange everything for you.</p><p>Some options are missing in the Mac version of the Card Manager. I'm not able to shrink the GDI files for some reason. This is probably using something only available on PC. However, as the video mentions, shrinking GDI files is not a one-size-fits-all hammer solution. For full compatibility, it's best not to shrink.</p><div class='title'><b>Game Serial Numbers</b></div><p>Much like Playstation games, Dreamcast games each have a unique identifier. All retail games do this, but hacks, ports, and other self-published indie titles sometimes don't. For example, the Dreamcast port of Divi-Dead and Grand Theft Auto III share the same serial number when added to the card manager, T00001.</p><p>Just like the game title, you can freely edit serial numbers to whatever you like.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I changed Grand Theft Auto III's serial number to TGTA3. The only thing this disrupts is the boxart and metadata used for Open Menu, and we can fix that.</p><div class='title'><b>Open Menu</b></div><p>When the Menu Card Manager saves changes to the SD card, it copies all the menu information it has locally to the SD card. On PC, all of its dlls and subfolders are clearly visible. The openMenu files are stored in the following location: <code>tools/openMenu/menu_data</code>. This is true for the Mac version, too, but all the files are hidden inside of the app. Click on the GDMENUCardManager.app file and "Show Package Contents." From there, the openMenu files are located here: <code>Contents/MacOS/tools/openMenu/menu_data</code></p><p>By default, there's not much there, but that's where there <a href="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu" title="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu">Open Menu</a> download comes in. Unzip the latest release and copy all of the contents of <code>menu_data</code> into the above location. Click on Save Changes in the Menu Manager, and your openMenu is completely up to date.</p><div class='title'><b>Boxart and Metadata Changes</b></div><p>Among the Open Menu files we copied to the GD Menu app were 3 DAT files, <code>BOX.DAT</code>, <code>ICON.DAT</code>, and <code>META.DAT</code>. These are file databases which house boxart, game icon, and metadata for all the Dreamcast games. It has all retail games, indie games, and most other ports and hacks. But, it doesn't have everything. And if you changed any serial numbers, it definitely doesn't have those games.</p><p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> will allow you to edit them. You can add new images (PNG format only) and create the menu icon from that. You can add and edit any metadata for games, too.</p><p>Save all the changes back to the DAT files for the Card Manager. And then "Save Changes" in the Card Manager to apply the changes to the SD card.</p><div class='title'><b>Preparation Complete</b></div><p>For the time being, my preparations are complete. I have loaded my SD card with over 100 discs. You can take a look at what I have available by viewing my <a href="/old/v7/modded-console-game-inventory" title="/modded-console-game-inventory">Game Inventory</a>.</p><p>I'll start getting the physical mods in the mail over the next few weeks. Then after summer vacation, I should have my Dreamcast available to install the mods.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Botanical - The Four Gentlemen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-four-gentlemen">Lego Botanical - The Four Gentlemen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These two new releases complement the releases from summer last year to create "The Four Gentlemen" of flowers, a classic staple of Chinese art representing ideal virtues and each of the four seasons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These flowers (or plants) are the Chrysanthemum, the Plum Blossom, the Orchid, and the Bamboo, representing fall, winter, spring, and summer. I built each of these while streaming on Twitch, so take a look at the videos if you'd like.</p><p>Plum Blossom: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI</a><br/>Mini Orchid: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo</a><br/>Lucky Bamboo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M</a><br/>Chrysanthemum: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8</a></p><p>The Four Gentlemen or Four Noble Ones originated in Chinese art over 1000 years ago. The Kanji for this is <span class='ja'>四君子</span>, which reads <i>shikunshi</i> <span class='ja'>しくんし</span> in Japanese. Gentlemen, in this context, refers to an individual that exhibits virtues and morality that all people should aspire to. Each of the flowers represents different virtues stemming from their season.</p><p>In Lego release order, the Chrysanthemum <span class='ja'>菊</span> represents fall. Despite the cooler weather, the flower blooms with bright energetic warm colors. It's generally considered a loner as its virtue is to share joy and shine proudly as yourself withstanding all adversities. It also symbolizes longevity.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Winter is represented by the Plum Blossom <span class='ja'>梅</span>. Its petals bloom a sharp crimson contrasting the coldest whitest months of the year. Though, not the most beautiful flower, it continues the bloom its best in a time of the year when most other flowers can't survive. As such, the Plum represents inner beauty and humbleness.</p><p>Leading into the new year, the Orchid <span class='ja'>蘭</span> represents Spring. The orchid is a fragile flower, soft in a form and fragrance. It is often referred to as the most inoffensive flower. While Spring often represents new beginning, the orchid symbolizes nobility, friendship, and integrity, enduring life despite its frail form.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The blazing summer months are represented by the Bamboo <span class='ja'>竹</span>. Physically, the bamboo is the absolute strongest of the Four Gentlemen, able to bend without breaking against harsh winds and rain. By yielding and not breaking, its virtues are cultivation, integrity, and loyalty. Bamboo is also hollow despite its strength, which also represents tolerance, humility, and open-mindedness.</p><p>Altogether, the Four Gentlemen say you should be true to yourself, represent yourself with dignity and humility, and also stay true to others.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As Lego sets, these look amazing and pair really well with the full-sized <a href="lego-orchid" title="lego-orchid">Lego Orchid</a>, released in the second wave of Botanical sets in 2022. </p><p>Each of these sets have some form of repetition in their building, but it's really not bad considering each set only takes a full hour to build. The repetitious parts will only take about 5 minutes max. All sets have uncommon building techniques and parts usage that you probably hadn't thought of before. For example, the bulb of Chrysanthemum is created using over 30 lego bananas in different shades of yellow and orange. The flowers of the Mini Orchid use 3 handheld shield pieces, an interesting reference back to the Full Orchid, which uses 3 full-body shield pieces in its flowers.</p><p>Each are fun builds, look great, and are super cheap at only $30 each.</p><p>If you were going to buy only one set out of them all, it's hard to recommend just one. My favorites are the Bamboo and the Chrysanthemum. Both of these sets look amazing at both a distance and up close. Originally, I skipped the Chrysanthemum because I thought the orange would outshine the others. It does quickly draw the eye, but the subtle perfection of the Bamboo can hold your eye just as long. Even though both are striking, I think they stay in their own lane as part of an ensemble. I think the Mini Orchid is the weakest. The bulbs on the full Orchid look more like flowers and less like Lego than the Mini-version.</p><p>All of them together create a very nice ensemble. There's still room on that shelf for more flowers, so I'm looking forward to the next Botanical sets Lego plans on releasing this year, and beyond.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okami" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okami">Okami</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I feel like everyone knows Okami and everyone loves Okami, but has everyone really played it? I don't think it really gets brought up in conversations past its art style. That's the camp I was in. I really liked the idea of Okami. I even bought it back in the day, but never really played it.</p><p>At the Game Awards, an Okami Sequel was announced, which put the original game back on my immediate backlog. With revisiting a lot of classic games lately, I wanted to finally give Okami its shot.</p><p>And, it's incredible. (I played through the PS4 version of Okami HD)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearly 20 years after its original release, its art style still looks fresh and stunning. The heavy thick black inked outlines create imagery invoking Japanese calligraphy and traditional painting matching the fairytale story it tells.</p><p>The story of the game starts like a fairytale, explaining a 100-year-old legend, a battle between the ultimate evil, the 8-headed serpent Orochi, being defeated by a hapless warrior, Nagi, and a wolf. The wolf was killed in battle, so the town erected a statue in her honor. Now, 100 years later, you emerge from the statue, a reincarnation of the wolf and the goddess of the sun, Okami Amaterasu. Someone broke the seal of Orochi, which has released you from the statue, so you now explore the land, cleanse the land of its curse, defeat his minions, and make your way to its layer reenacting the legend.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Okami is a very standard action adventure game which feels reminiscent of early 3D Legend of Zelda games. Through exploring, more areas of Japan are opened with more secrets and introducing more characters. Story sequences thrust you into exploring dungeons and defeating the monsters within. This results in giving you new weapons and abilities to expand your exploration in the world and also backtracking for previous secrets.</p><p>The abilities you gain are executed using brush strokes. Hit the R1 button, and the whole scene pulls back to an inking canvas. Move the brush around to create strokes matching your abilities. Return to the scene, and the abilities execute by blooming trees, slashing enemies, and blowing wind.</p><p>Much like classic Zelda games, the story really opens up after completing the initial story sequence, the recreation of the 100-year legend. Evil still reigns in further areas of Japan, so you continue to chase after the shadows of the true evil.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Up until this point, I had not really noticed how much of Okami was steeped in Japanese fairytales. I thought it was telling its own story. I did not know that the story of Orochi and Nagi was an actual Shinto tale until reaching the next section of the game.</p><p>When reaching the major city, you meet Momotaro, try to locate Onigashima, also meet Urashimataro, and swim to the bottom of the sea to Ryuguujou (the Dragon Palace), and meet Otohime. You also meet Princes Sakuya, cut from Bamboo. These are all Japanese tales I'm quite familiar film. Momotaro and Onigashima is probably the most well known fairytale in Japan. All the kids here know it. The One-Inch Prince is another Japanese tale that I had read before and never made the connection to Issun, your companion throughout the whole game.</p><p>I'm not a Japanese fairytale or mythical expert, so many of these things went over my head on their first pass, but it never detracted from the experience for me. All of these stories felt natural within the story of Okami. There are fun references to real lore that really enhance the experience rather than use it as a crutch.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised by Okami. The Japanese mythology, the overall structure and crafted nature of the gameplay and exploration, and the length of the game. I completed a full 100% playthrough in 52 hours. That's the same length as Twilight Princess, which came out a few months after Okami's original release.</p><p>Overall, I think a lot of people skipped Okami because the Playstation 2 was waning at that point. The Xbox 360 was released the year prior, and games looked FAR more incredible than the PS2. Okami released in September, and in just a few more months, the Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii would be released. The future!</p><p>Personally, I was so busy finishing college in Spring and study abroad in Japan for my final semester in the Fall. When I came back in 2007, I immediately played Twilight Princess and then focused on other games.</p><p>Also, as much as the art style is one of Okami's strongest points, cell shading was very divisive at the time. People hated Legend of Zelda Wind Waker because of its art style, and Twilight Princess was finally the realistic Zelda everyone wanted. I think this looked too "kiddy" for the PS2 crowd.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm glad that I finally took the time to play through Okami, and I think more people really should do the same.

I had begun moving away from Twitch and streaming, while focusing a lot on other gaming projects and other retro games. There were still some huge games this year, but I played a lot of games as more of a distraction from work.</p><p>My year began with my continuation of playing through classic Zelda games. I had played through Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 at the end of the last year, and I started this year with Link's Awakening and the Oracle games on Gameboy. I finished up the Oracle games before the release of the biggest game this year.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</b> was released in February, and it dominating my thoughts for the next two months. It's incredible that with such an expansive and huge game, all aspects felt hand-crafted and refined. Often huge open-world games use a lot of recycled quests or dungeons, using a script to manufacture its quantity. People argue there's too much stuff in Rebirth, but it's all there for the purpose of flushing out characters, lore, and story.</p><p>Both FF7 Remake and Rebirth are amazing examples of the lengths Nomura will go to retell the overall story of Final Fantasy 7 completely, which has been expanded upon over the 25 years since its original release. Everything feels like it's been completely thought out, even though the pacing is perhaps a bit much. I really hope the can stick the landing with the final game in the trilogy.</p><p>Following Rebirth's story, once again, I went back to YouTube and watched a playthrough of the original Final Fantasy 7 to compare the story. It made me really nostalgic for the original playstation, especially Final Fantasy 8. I had always preferred FF8 because of its characters, but I've largely forgotten it all at this point.</p><p>I started looking into what it would take to play old Playstation and Playstation 2 games, and with several videos on YouTube showing how this was done, I put together a <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">PlayStation 2 set-up</a> to have access to all those games from my high school and college years.</p><p>This became somewhat cyclical as I played a lot of Earth Defense Force 2 on PS2, then moved back to the PlayStation 5 for the recent release of <b>Earth Defense Force 6</b>. Both excellent games of running around and shooting gigantic bugs and monsters. EDF6 is probably the best in the series at this point, combining modern graphics and frame rate with the highest variety of enemies in the whole series. I bought the Japanese version to save some money, which ended up being a mistake because I missed out on the campy English performances.</p><p>After the harsh Spring and Summer, I went back to story-driven games with <a href="/old/v7/dead-space" title="/dead-space"><b>Dead Space</b></a> and <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol"><b>The Callisto Protocol</b></a>, actually taking photos in game and exploring their stories and ideas.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>The Switch didn't see a lot of play this year as I took a break from Pokemon and Twitch.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Surprisingly, in Spring, Nintendo announced a new Zelda was coming in September. We had just gotten Tears of the Kingdom last year, and already we're getting another game.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: <b>Echoes of Wisdom</b> was the first canon Zelda game where you actually played as Zelda. It featured a creative game mechanic of using objectives in the environment to climb, fight, and explore the world to eventually save Link. Its style immediately identified itself as being developed by Grezzo, who did the <b>Link's Awakening Remake</b> from a few years ago. As such, I bought that and played through that as well.</p><p>Leading up to summer, I played through the remake of <b>Super Mario RPG</b> on Switch. It was interesting playing through both remakes so close to each other along with FF7. Nintendo has an absolute vibrant history of games. Everyone has their own interpretations of those games and how they could best be adapted to today. Mario RPG does almost nothing to modernize itself beyond some quality of life changes to the gameplay. The story, the maps, and the pacing are all the same from the original. Link's Awakening is pretty much the same, too. It's the complete opposite of Final Fantasy 7.</p><p>There's obviously no one best approach to remaking games. Would you rather have a gaming experience that reminds you of your childhood by playing a semi-modern version of the old game? Or would you rather have a new experience reliving the old story with the characters and lore you remember? For this year, Final Fantasy has had much more of an impact on me than these Nintendo remakes.</p><div class='title'><b>Retro</b></div><p>This year, with cheaper versions being release, I finally bought a Mister. This complements my Playstation 2 and Analogue Pocket for having access to decades of gaming history. Many of these older games still hold up quite well without the need of a remake or new version. I played through <b>Snatcher</b> for the first time in decades and it's still an incredible experience, and one that I don't think would translate well to a modern remake.</p><p>I feel incredible fortunate to have access to all these games from my past. And while I don't always have the time to play, I'm also grateful for the time I do have along with a platform to show them off.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
