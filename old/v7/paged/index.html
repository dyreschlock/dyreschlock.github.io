| February 3, 2026 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mostly on a whim, I picked up Silent Hill f. Silent Hill is a franchise that I have very little interaction with, but I was very intrigued with the setting in this new game. It takes place in a rural Japanese mountain village in the 1960s, a location and time period I am very interested in. Recently, I have done a lot of research and traveling to similar old abandoned buildings and villages up here in the mountains. Its fictional town of Ebisugaoka even uses a nearby village as a reference.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212240_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, Silent Hill f is an incredible work of art that continues to build its story on its fringes. I think it also builds a desire for knowledge about its themes and history, so people find themselves reading every note and scrap of paper they find. Everything forms together to create an overall picture I have tried to capture in this writing.</p><p>Also, the story is told through multiple playthroughs, and this post spoilers and tries to explain everything. I have spoiler warnings as the post goes on, but if you plan on playing Silent Hill f, I would suggest not reading too far. Experience the game for yourself, and come back later. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Silent Hill from the point of view of Silent Hill 2</b></div><p>Silent Hill is a horror game series, and it refers to the name of the town where the game takes place (Silent Hill, Maine, USA), inspired by Stephen King novels and Twin Peaks. The overall series of games is like an anthology. Each game focuses on different characters when they find themselves in the town.</p><p>Like most people, I think, I have only played Silent Hill 2 back in the day on Playstation 2. I played through the game and got a couple of the endings. I never played the first game. I skipped it because it looked like a cheap version of Resident Evil. The second game felt like a better realized version of what they wanted to do.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093353_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There is a dense fog in Silent Hill, and within the fog, people who come to the town become lost and trapped. The fog becomes a metaphor for the turmoil and sadness in their lives, and those fears become physical manifestations. For example, there is a character who has often been rejected in their life, so the town feels cold and dark to them. He is often heard talking with nameless figures who don't return his gazes or conversation. </p><p>This is one of the tamer examples. Silent Hill features a lot of grotesque imagery and gore. These are physical representations of equally grotesque mental and physical abuses. Another woman, as the fog creeps in and alters the world into its netherworld state, views the buildings and walls as flesh. It often pulsates and pistons are shown violating it, refering to violations of her in her past.</p><p>I don't remember a lot about the actual story in Silent Hill 2, but I vividly remember a <b>plot twist</b> when other characters mention they haven't seen any monsters or grotesque creatures out to get them in the way you have. These monsters were unique and emblematic of your own haunted past, and beating them down is another way of the game showing how your character deals with his fears. Supress fear and trauma, and move on.</p><div class='title'><b>Silent Hill f's Role in the Silent Hill series</b></div><p>Silent Hill f departs from many of the ideas of the main series. The largest being the timeframe and setting. The game does not take place in Silent Hill, Maine, but takes place in Ebisugaoka, Japan around the early 1960s. (There are various dates on calendars in the game showing 1960 and 1962.) (I'll get back to this later, but Ebisugaoka was inspired by Kanayama village in Gero, Gifu, near where I live.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118212046_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Our main character is also a large departure. We play as Hinako Shimizu, a female high school student. You aren't playing as a man with a flashlight, looking for his lost wife or daughter or whatever. As the writer explains, women in Silent Hill have traditionally been victims and suffered from the actions often determined by their male protagonists. He wanted to make a Silent Hill story where a woman had control of her own story and trauma. </p><p>As the game begins, you have a fight with your parents and run into town to find your friends to talk. When talking with your friends in the town's center, the fog creeps in and consumes the town. Then monsters begin to appear.</p><p>Another departure from the main series is the singular focus of the threat. Your friends can see the same monsters just as plainly as you can. You all run away from them chasing you, and avoid them as much as possible. And they can die to those same monsters. While characters in previous games had their own fears raelized within the fog, this circumstance seems entirely based on you.</p><p>Although...  Are your friends real? The fog creates a dream-like state that makes it hard to tell whether or not this is actual reality.</p><div class='title'><b>The Netherwold</b></div><p>In previous games, a siren would blare through the fog and the real world seemed to alter and change into a darker version of itself. This is where monsters would appear and attack you. The Netherworld of Silent Hill f is a different plain of existance.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118225629_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the end of sequences in Ebisugaoka, Hinako will hear a pounding sound that knocks her out. When she wakes, she appears in an ethereal world of Japanese spirits with a man in a fox mask guiding her forward. She seemingly has no choice but to follow him and solve various puzzles to push her way forward, bringing her closer to the fox mask.</p><p>Progression in Silent Hill f bounces back and forth between these two worlds as you discover more about yourself, your friends, and the overall story that explains these events.</p><div class='title'><b>Atmosphere and Tension through Sound</b></div><p><b>Akira Yamaoka</b> is back! Yamaoka has been doing sound and music for the Silent Hill series since the beginning. (One of his earliest projects as Konami was converting sound and music for Snatcher to Sega CD and other CD platforms! Big fan!) Silent Hill 2 was his first project as a full lead for sound design and music at Konami. And he continued that role with Silent Hill 3 and especially Silent Hill 4 having more control as Producer.</p><p>One aspect of Silent Hill f that feels greatly heightened compared with previous titles is Yamaoka's sound. Silent Hill 2 was always eerie and atmospheric. There was that hum in the background, and the scratchy static of your pocket radio as you got near certain areas of importance. It built tension and uneasiness. But, it's impact never really stayed with me. It kinda felt like a gimmick.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119121858_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It wasn't until Dead Space where it felt like sound design could become the centerpoint for forcing immersion you couldn't ignore. Music and sound in games has always been important, but both Dead Space and Silent Hill f overpower you with sound. It's like an assault on your ears and it conveys an overall sense of dread and danger as monsters lurk and hunt you. Occassionally, monsters will hide in the sound.</p><p>Silent Hill f does have some ballads, but most of the music heard through normal gameplay doesn't have a lot of strong melodies to grasp. It often feels like chaos with pounding taiko drums, sharp twangs of Kote, and other unnerving sounds from traditional Japanese instruments mixed with modern electric guitars. It feels like chaos, but its organized chaos. In some ways it feels like a modern society being held back by its traditions.</p><p><b>Headphones are necessary</b> for the full experience. You feel completely immersed in the situation, setting, and story, and sometimes it gets so loud, you want to cover your ears, but you can't. The sound sometimes makes you feel like you're struggling to break free, much like our main character, Hinako.</p><div class='title'><b>Themes (Spoilers)</b></div><p>Despite wanting to give women more agency, Hinako often takes a very passive approach to any slights or aggressive towards her (at least in the beginning). When it sounds like your friends are talking behind your back, you say nothing. When your "boyfriend not boyfriend" Shu asks you your feelings, you don't answer directly. Also, you seem somewhat controlled by the fox mask in the netherworld. These microaggressions do build, but they are compounded by the overall theme of Hinako's trauma.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119093333_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As a child, Hinako hated playing with dolls and loved playing outdoor games with Shu. They often played this make-believe space wars game together and ran around the neighborhood "shooting aliens." But, everyone thinks this is odd and makes snide comments about how she'll never get married if she gets scars. They yell at Shu as well to stop playing with girls. But they still play together, and refer to each other as their partner. </p><p>Because of this forced separation, boys and girls don't talk to each other with familarity or as equals. (A bit of this is lost in translation with the English dub.) As teenagers, this separation is pushed further as they are now nearly adults. Society forces Hinako to act more like a woman. It's weird that Shu treats Hinako like a true friend and an equal.</p><p>Their behavior particularly annoys their friend, Rinko, who has a crush on Shu. Their behavior makes Rinko incredibly jealous, especially when Hinako doesn't seem to put any thought into being a girl or even acknowledge any possible romantic feelings Shu might have for her.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119101022_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hinako's hatred towards forced gender roles goes further when you learn more about her family. Her father is abusive. He is verbally and emotionally abusive to his wife and daughters, and we read later that he is also physically abusive to his wife, Hinako's mother. He takes the frustrations of his life out on them by always yelling, and blaming his faults on them. </p><p>His actions are reenforced by society's standards (1960s rural Japan), and it's rather common behavior for men. Women are subordinate. You read later that other households in Ebisugaoka tend to be the same. Hinako finds a letter from a woman terrified of her life from her husband beating her. But she can't run away and leave her children behind. "Life is too hard to keep living, but I'm forbidden to die."</p><p>Hinako hates him for all of his abuses, and she hates her mother, too, because she always takes his abuse, and she always covers for him, lies for him, and defends him. In a flashback, Hinako actually stands up against his abuses by yelling at her father, pointing out his mistakes, and yelling at her mother asking why she doesn't stand up to him. But, by society's standards, Hinako is the one out of line.</p><p>Both of them yell back at her. The mother defending the father, and the father acting out against her. To end this argument, her father throws his large cooking knife at her, and it sticks in the ground at her feet.</p><p>The overall forced gender roles is the center of Silent Hill f.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119100645_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Throughout the game you face against grotesque monsters that follow this theme. You fight female mannequins who are puppets to someone else's wishes. Blind male monsters who want to grab you, beat you, and lick you. Faceless brutality. Male monsters with multiple heads and eyes looking all directions spewing bloody bile on the ground spreading their filth. And bloated pregnant monsters spawning more puppets. Gross, but it's inventive how Silent Hill f creates its own monsters rather than relying on Japanese yokai for designs.</p><p>The game continues to build as you meet the physical representation of the fog, yourself.</p><div class='title'><b>Forced Decision (Huge Spoilers)</b></div><p>The narration leaves you in the dark on a lot of details surrounding Hinako, her friends, and family. These details slowly reveal themselves through reading newpaper snippets and documents found throughout the game, and some dialogue between characters.</p><p>Hinted and foreshadowed at the beginning, Hinako must make a decision, although this decision is forced on her by her father. That decision is a <b>marriage proposal</b>, which terrifies Hinako.</p><p>What does marriage actually mean in Japan?</p><div class='title'><b>Edo Peroid Japanese Marriage</b></div><p>After World War II, so many of Japan's old ways were revised and "modernized" with a new constitution. Some of the largest changes were women's rights, many of which were only recently ratified in America. </p><p>In pre-modern Japan (up through the 1860s), the concept of households became the basic building block of society. A household, or your family unit, not only determined your social status and role in society, but defined you as a person. To build a family and serve your household was your purpose in life, and supporting you family above your own interests was paramount. Wikipedia mentions a quote, "the choice to remain single is the greatest crime a man could commit."</p><p>The father was head of the household and he was legally responsible for all family members. (This also means that his family members were legally bound to him.) Finding marriages for his children was one of his main responsibilities. Love and feelings had nothing to do with marriage, and it was seen as childish and improper to have any kind of preference in a spouse. </p><p>When a woman married, she married into the other family. Wikipedia mentions that the old word for marriage in Japanese was <i>yomeiri</i> or <span class='ja'>嫁入り</span>. When you separate the bits of kanji apart, it says, "the woman enters (or joins) the home." The other household takes the woman into theirs, and she abandons her old household and her old family.</p><p>As a member of her new household, she basically becomes a maid. Men were taught and encouraged to place the needs of their parents and children before the needs of their wife. Another fun Wikipedia quote, "If you love your wife, you spoil your mother's servant."</p><div class='title'><b>Meiji Period Japanese Marriage</b></div><p>During the Meiji Restoration (starting from around the 1860s), these ideas not only continued but somewhat strengthened. Rapid industrialization and urbanization brought more families together into densely packed cities. Public education became more and more universal, which pushed family roles and gender roles as a matter of fact. People were to first devote themselves to the nation, then to their family, then to themselves, and fill their roles within. Women were taught as daughters to obey their father, as wives to obey their husband, and as widows to obey their sons.</p><p>There was extreme segregation of genders during this period, too. Boys and Girls were separated at schools and social gatherings. Unwed men and women who became romantically involved could be fired from their jobs or even arrested (in WWII). Another quote, "It is deemed a sign of mental and moral weakness to fall in love."</p><p>As education for women became more common, women began to fight back. Wikipedia mentions that Japanese women's fight for divorce around 1900 was the beginning of Japanese feminism. Though, it wouldn't be until the 1920s when they had their first success changing a single law. The fight continued for decades about voting rights, divorce, and other antiquated laws until their whole government was rewritten.</p><div class='title'><b>Post-War</b></div><p>After Japan's surrender in 1945, the United States rewrote and rebuilt nearly all aspects of Japanese government which trickled into Japanese society. Women had their voting rights, divorce rights, and were now legally equal. "All people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of creed, sex, social status or family origin."</p><p>However, writing this down on a piece of paper and saying its true, doesn't make it immediately true in the eyes of people who have lived for centuries under the opposite idea. It takes time for change, and even more time in isolated rural villages where people tend to follow their own laws.</p><p>Wikipedia Sources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Japan#Edo_period_(1600%E2%80%931868)" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Japan#Edo_period_(1600%E2%80%931868)">Japanese Marriage</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism_in_Japan" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism_in_Japan">Japanese Feminism</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Bride Price or Dowry</b></div><p>One other thing to point out is that through arranged marriages, it was a tradition for the groom's family to "pay" the bride's family. Often the "price" was meant to boost their bride's family status to become more equal to that of the groom's. I think families always tried to bargin their daughters off into equal or weathier families, never down.</p><p>Putting a smiley face on it, it's a showing of appreciation to the bride's parents for raising such a good (or obedient) daughter. You could also maybe think of this as compensation for losing a family member. Or, you could think of it how it actually sounds, human trafficking. Seems like fathers were barginning for their daughters and being sold as property, especially if their new household legally "owned" them.</p><p>I think in some areas and families in Japan, bride prices may still be practiced.</p><div class='title'><b>Forced Decision (back to Silent Hill f)</b></div><p>Through Silent Hill f's first playthrough and first ending, all the hints and signs come together that Hinako is being forced to marry.</p><p>Her path in the real world is her true self.

In marriage, she would be torn away from her life, so her friends and family of her past life would be as good as dead to her. You also read random snippets of newspaper saying Shimizu Hinako has disappeared or died.

Fox Mask leads Hinako down the hallways of ceremony and rituals. Her arm is sawed off and replaced with another. A massive hanko burns and melts a new family crest into her back. And her face is sliced off and replaced with a mask that matches Fox Mask. Hinako is becoming his property.</p><p>At the very end of the ceremony, she quivers and collapses as red blighted flowers consume her body.

The moral of the story is to not trust a fox. Although, often foxes end up getting comeuppance for their deads, so the other moral of the story is to not be a fox. Don't trick or deceive others.</p><p>But, foxes aren't all bad. The bad ones often take human form. The good ones are more of a component of nature. </p><p>The Inari Gods in Shintoism began as gods to worship to protect or increase yields in rice farms. Foxes became associated with them because they are a natural deterrent against rodents who destroy rice fields. Foxes eat those rodents, and through some evolutionary traits, fox urine has become a natural repellent for rodents. Folks in olden times would present a fox urine soaked rock as an offereing to an Inari shrine. Thanks for the piss?</p><p>In folklore, foxes tend to be loyal to their debts. Good deeds are often repaid. And bad deeds are often met with mallice.</p><p>In Ebisugaoka (Silent Hill f), the main shrine in town is the Sennensugi Shrine, which worships the Inari god. Its on the top of a hill in the north, but it has fallen on hard times through the urbanization of Japan and its aging population. For the older generation, its inconvenient for them to climb the hill when they want to pay their respects, so they just use one of the small roadside Inari shrines that are all over town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260119090853_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Your friend Sakuko is the last in line of the family who administrate Sennensugi Shrine, and her grandfather is head priest. As mentioned, people don't visit the shrine anymore because its up on the hill, and her father doesn't really care for the religion. He refused to take over as head priest, and works an office job instead. As such, her grandfather remarks that the shrine will die with his generation.</p><p>Some notes in the game remark that a god's power is only as strong as people's belief and worship in that god. With more people devout to them, their power and protection grows. There is a reciprocal bond between humans and gods, and the stronger the bond, the more prosperous the relationship. As the number of worshippers wane, so does the god's power and protection. Its also worth noting that discretion of Inari shrines in town results in mysterious horrible grotesque deaths, so people always respect Inari, whether they want to or not.</p><p>Sakuko is a miko of the shrine, and she loves it. She often thinks about being head priest in the future and how she can restore the shrine. Mikos are shrine maidens who perform spiritual cleansings and provide individual rites to people for protection and healing. (spoilers) She's the first to die. This basically signals that all the good will towards foxes is now gone, and they no longer have any obligation to provide protection. As soon as she dies at the beginning of the game, the fog grows and consumes the town.</p><div class='title'><b>Fox Possession <span class='ja'>狐憑き</span></b></div><p>Fox Possession is a key theme used for our groom. </p><p>In Japanese folklore, it's possible for anyone to become possessed by a fox spirit, but it is most common when a person caters to a fox spirit in exchange for some kind of magical services. Once a man is possessed, this possession extends to their family and is passed down to the next generation.</p><p>While good deeds are repaid with good deeds, a deal where "you do this for me and I'll do this for you" is employment, and foxes will always take advantage of the situation. If a fox spirit is constantly appeased, the possessed is often given good fortune. However, this often comes at the expense and tragedy of others. For example, some foxes would bring their masters money, but it was stolen from their neighbors. Foxes are also known to cause illness and death towards the possessed's enemies.</p><p>It is later revealed that our groom is <b>Kotoyuki Tsuneki</b>, and there's a long line of notes you find that describe his and his family's past.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260118224206_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Tsuneki family is the most notable and rich family in the area. They live somewhere outside of Ebisugaoka, but their pressence is known throughout the region. There's a saying that the Tsuneki family always has good fortune when the world is in disorder, hinting at their connection to fox magic.</p><p>One day years ago, the hier to the Tsuneki family saw the most beautiful farm girl. Being of a far lower class, they could never marry, but he still courted her and they had a secret affair. Months later, his father found a suitable wife for his son, so the beautiful farm girl was cast aside even though she was pregnant with his son. She was banished into the mountains, and lived in Ebisugaoka. This was Kotoyuki's mother, and a few months later, Kotoyuki was born.</p><p>As a child, his mother always forced Kotoyuki to focus on his studies. "You are the true hier to the Tsuneki family. You can't waste your time playing games. You are an adult in a child's body, and you will rise as the head of the Tsuneki family." Kotoyuki hated this.</p><p>At age 9, Kotoyuki was playing in town with other boys. It was not uncommon for wild foxes to come into town. Older generations know how to treat the animals with care, but the younger generation don't understand this and try to chase and provoke them. One day, a wild fox attacked Kotoyuki in town, leaving deep cuts on his face. Young 5 or 6 year-old Hinako "saved" him by treating the fox with kindness. "It's just sacred. Please go away fox." In a note later, Kotoyuki remarks that he just met the most beautiful girl.</p><p>His cuts festered and boiled into a fever of 40 degrees. He lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital. By the time he reached the hospital, the cuts were gone. At one point he woke up with a glassy look. Nurses asked his name, but he couldn't remember. Physically, it was like nothing had happened at all. But, mentally, his mother remarked that he felt like a completely different person. He no longer cared about games, and devoted himself completely to his studies. You later find a note that says, "I must become the perfect match for Hinako."</p><p>You also find this quote, "If a fox falls in love at first sight, they will try to steal her away as their bride."</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220741_t.webp" /></a></p><p>A few years later, the head of the Tsuneki family (Kotoyuki's father) and his wife contracted an unknown illness. They had high fevers, and their skin had sores. Some days, they would vomit profusely. A few days later, their son and daughters began showing the same symptoms. A few days later still, the father and mother died and their corpses were bloated and disgusting, emitting a horrible smell. Their only son's illness also grew, and he met the same fate. They were immediately cremated, and none of this news was ever publicized. Though, with the death of all hiers, the daughters made a miraculous recovery.</p><p>Their symptoms and deaths are consistent with other medical notes you find about drunken members of town desecrating Inari statues and foxes in Ebisugaoka.</p><p>It's not mentioned in the game, but this was probably around the same time middle-school-aged Kotoyuki played a game of <b>Fox Gathering</b> with his friends at school. Fox Gathering is like a seance where kids each write their names on a board, turn out the lights, and sing the Fox Gathering song in a circle. When the lights are turned back on, each name is given their future. All these futures are bad except for one person. Kotoyuki's name was the only one not crossed out with the message, "All your dreams will come true."</p><p>Some say that a fox gathering isn't just a way of telling someone's future, but often foxes will that future to become reality.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124110230_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the head of the Tsuneki family dead and his son, too, the grandfather sends a message to Kotoyuki's mother to legitimize Kotoyuki as the new hier. They move away from Ebisugaoka, and Kotoyuki becomes <b>Kotoyuki Tsuneki</b> head of the Tsuneki family. He has now returned for Hinako's hand in marriage.</p><div class='title'><b>Fox Wedding <span class='ja'>狐の嫁入り</span></b></div><p>So, it's clear that Kotoyuki has been possessed by a fox and that the Tsuneki also has strong ties with fox possession. The concept of a fox wedding has more meanings than just this literal case, and it connects with the ideas of gods marrying mortals, which is referred to as a "hierogamous marriage."</p><p>An hierogamous marriage becomes beneficial for both sides of the marriage. A mortal becomes divine, and the god stengthens its ties with mortals. As mentioned before, a religion prospers when more people devoted to it. As gods gain more strength, so does their protection for the mortals. </p><p>People in Ebisugaoka have coined the phrase "fox wedding" in a similar way. When a woman is married, they abandon their home and are wisked away. It's like they have disappeared. So when a young girl goes missing and is never found, they call it a "fox wedding." Some wealthy fox lord scooped them up in marriage, and now they're living in a life of luxury without care. Despite the heavy feeling of loss, families are somewhat comforted by this idea.</p><p>Additionally, weddings between gods and mortal are rare. So when a god searches for a bride, they want to find a rare and exceptional match. In nearly 100,000 births, a girl is born with an exceptionally rare blood type. People often say that these girls are "blessed by the stars" because of their blood type. You find a note in the game from a woman named Mayumi who had a rare ABO blood type and was married to a fox.</p><p>Despite Hinako saying she is unremarkable, it is heavily implied that she also has a rare blood type.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260120194058_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Another thing to note is what a fox wedding actually looks like. In Japanese folklore, a fox wedding happens around dusk when someone sees a trail of lights leading through the forest. These lights are lanterns held by foxes in a wedding procession. The above painting near the end of the game depicts a classic scene of a fox wedding.</p><div class='title'><b>Yamata no Orochi <span class='ja'>八岐大蛇</span> and the origin of Ebisugaoka's faith</b></div><p>The Inari Faith and foxes are just one side of the coin. Ebisugaoka's Inari faith is an amalgamation of the town's original beliefs that span over a millennia. And it all began with the Japanese myth of Susanoo defeating the evil eight-headed dragon Orochi. In battle, Susanoo got the dragon drunk on strong tubs of sake, and sliced off its heads one-by-one. (Remember <a href="/old/v7/okami" title="/okami">Okami</a>??)</p><p>One of its heads flew away and crashed in the mountains of Higa becoming a poisonous water dragon plaguing the land where it fell. Because of the poisonous water, few people ever went to this area, and it only became inhabited when shamed defeated warriors of the Taira clan found refuge hiding here. Higa later became known as Ebisugaoka. People believe that this legend stemmed from the occassional toxic gas leaks in underground water streams.</p><p>The people of the area idolized the poison water dragon as a means to protect themselves from its poison. This was the area's original faith. After this, nearly 800 years ago, a freakishly tall monk wearing multiple masks came to the area. He brought the people to a great cedar tree and told them to devote themselves to it. "This great tree saps evil from the water dragon below. Devote yourselves to this tree, and it will qwell the beast to the end of time." This began the faith in the Divine Tree.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171115_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Because Ebisugaoka was remote, it was impossible to trade items with other towns, so people had to treat their tools with the utmost care. As tools became spent, people would bring their tools to the divine tree as an offering. This would grow faith and power in the divine tree. Over time, this custom began more and more common that people had forgot these offerings were meant as tribute to seal the water dragon.</p><p>This twisting of the Divine Tree faith had formed the Tsukumogami faith. More respect should be given to things the more they age. Thus, the older something becomes the more respect it should have and the more divine it becomes. The Tsukumogami faith also believes that when objects have existed for so long they gain a spirit of their own. Because the divine tree was the oldest object in town at nearly 1000 years old, it was the center of the Tsukumogami faith. A shrine was built around the tree on the west end of town.</p><p>It should be noted that when the disgraced warriors of Taira clan settled the area, they vowed revenge against the members that banished them. Their weapons and gear had been lost to time, maybe destroyed or traded away. But one sword still remained in Higa (Ebisugaoka), and it soaked in the feelings of revenge and malice from the former clansmen. Through the Tsukumogami faith, this sword now had a life of its own and remained hidden.</p><p>Through some puzzle solving in the second playthrough, the lost sword, the <b>sacred sword</b>, reveals itself to you.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124171104_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the Edo Period (1600s / 1700s), lightning struck the thousand-year-old divine tree, and the fire spread to burn the tree and the shrine. People believed that the tree had lost all of its divine power, so through the Tsukumogami faith, they searched for the next oldest object in town to praise. This was a moss-covered Inari statue north of the divine tree in the woods.</p><p>Inari priests told the townspeople that an ancient evil water dragon was set free from the divine tree now that is has lost its power. But, the foxes are here to protect you. A family of foxes rose up to save our town from this threat. They hold the dragon at bay, but our faith in them gives them power. We must devote ourselves to them to receive their protection.</p><p>Thus, Ebisugaoka's faith changed again, now to the Inari faith. People began praying to the Inari for protection, but it was warped and twisted with Ebisugaoka's history of faith. It became confused with the ideas of the Tsukumogami faith. Over time, the Inari faith in Ebisugaoka became its own branch of the religion, almost completely different than elsewhere.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260131220018_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But the moss-covered Inari statue was not the oldest object in town. This was the sacred sword, which was infused with its own spirit of revenge in the true faith of Tsukumogami. On the inside, it was considered blasphemy that the people would abandon their faith. On the outside, knowing the sword's existence could destabilize the Inari faith in town. The sword wanted its revenge against the foxes.</p><p>A final bit of history was a murder spree that happened in the 1880s. A man over two feet tall covered in tree bark came into town with a sword and killed everyone he found worshipping Inari statues. He called everyone hethens for not respecting faith to the Divine Tree. The water dragon will rise again because of your blasphemy. Legend says that the spree ended when a thick fog rolled in carrying a pack of foxes which devoured him completely.</p><p>In recent years, with faith in the Inari wanning, there are some people who believe the town is cursed because they no longer truly devote themselves to the religion. In 1945, there were a series of small earthquakes and an onsen geyser erupted in town nearly 30 meters high. The water spewed a noxious hydrogen sulfide gas, and tests later showed it contained high levels of arsenic. People claim this caused sores and disease.</p><p>An alert was issued by the Disaster Prevention Division stating these small earthquakes could be a sign that the "big one" is coming soon.</p><div class='title'><b>Player Choices and Further Endings</b></div><p>By starting a New Game+, Hinako is armed with the knowledge of the red pills. She also has a fox brooch pinned to her lapel giving her the protection of Kotoyuki. Knowing the sinister nature of the red pills, avoiding them puts you on a path with two outcomes. </p><p>You need to find the sacred sword, and then determine whether to purge its life or keep it. By keeping the sacred sword as is, you will have its protection in the final battle. By purifying the sword of its vengeful soul, its protection is gone, and you rely on the protection of the fox brooch in the end. </p><p>There's also a third option available in your third and final playthrough by giving up both the sword and the brooch, relinqushing Hinako of all outside protections.</p><p>The red pills were protection given by Shu. The sacred sword was protection given by your past. And the brooch was protection given by Kotoyuki. Each of the four main endings align with the actors behind the protection. Once you reach your house, the Shimizu residence, in the last third or quarter of the game, you are locked into an ending.</p><p>As you shift through different layers of your warped home, you confront images of your past and finally confront yourself, which are all different depending on which ending you're locked into. Later at the end, you face the real threat.</p><div class='title'><b>Keeping the Sword's Protection (Ending 3)</b></div><p>When Hinako faces herself at home, her other self is terrified, weak, and completely panicked at what to do. Your journey throughout the game was killing your friends and family as a way of leaving them behind as you leave home in marriage. Your decision is ultimately choosing to kill your other self, or be killed. The panicked Hinako begs for death. Her face peels away to become what you hate the most, the bride. You are the protagonist.</p><p>Later in the end, as true Hinako, fox Hinako turns into the Shiromuku and you fight. You win, but Kotoyuki interferes. His body controts and transforms into a massive ratty matted nine-tailed fox. His handsome kind persona is completely dropped, as he screams and threatens you. "I have shown you nothing but kindness, but you refuse it. So I will take what it rightfully mine."</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260125140145_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By retaining the sacred sword with its full power, the sword is able to amplify the part of you that strongly holds on to the past. Throughout the game in the fox realm, this is represented by your old childhood doll, reminding you of who you are. Your true self is able to shine through any influence of your transformation by Kotoyuki. </p><p>Upon defeating the ratty fox, Shu appears and confesses his love for you and that he would do anything to protect you. He throws himself at the wounded fox, but you stop him. Leave him alone. You and Shu run away from the shrine, and appear in town. Hinako tells him that she can't marry Kotoyuki, and they run away together.</p><p>After the credits, a radio program reports that Ebisugaoka was consumed with Hydrogen Sulfide gas (the fog) and the entire town was evacuated. With Kotoyuki completely rejected and defeated, it seems like the divine protection of the Inari faith has collapsed. And ultimately, it seems like the sacred sword with the spirit of Tsukumogami had got its revenge. With the Inari faith gone, the poisonous water dragon was let loose.</p><div class='title'><b>Removing the Sword's Protection (Ending 2)</b></div><p>When Hinako faces herself at home, her other self screams at you for being childish. She screams at you to die die DIE! You find some letters in your drawers from Kotoyuki about the courtship showing him as loving and caring. Your face peels away to become what you hate the most, the bride. You are the antagonist.</p><p>Later in the end, as fox Hinako, true Hinako becomes warped and distorted, moving like a puppet seemingly controlled by a dark force.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124205606_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That spirit is easily snuffed out by Kotoyuki. Then Shu appears and exasperatingly confesses his love for you. He screams how he should have told you all of his feelings from the beginning and that he wants to be with you always. He also confesses that he used the red pills to try and break you free of this marriage.</p><p>Old tools, weapons, and masks consume his body. As fox Hinako, you finally defeat the last remaining bit of your past self, and can continue forward as wife to Kotoyuki Tsuneki. Shu accepts that Kotoyuki would make a fine husband for Hinako and gives him a fist bump as the morning sun rises to vanquish the horrible night.</p><p>With the final spirits of the Tsukumogami faith purified, and the wedding succeeded, the Inari faith has been appeased. The water dragon, hydrogen sulfide gas, fog, and mist all dissipate to reveal a clear day. The new day shines bright on Ebisugaoka.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260124211710_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It ends in a pretty goofy way, and everything seems all happy and perfect on the outside with smiles. But after the credits, the severed sliced off face of true Hinako lies on the ground in terror, sobbing, and begging for recompense. "I'm so sacred. I don't want to become my mother. He will become my father." Then her face is crushed and wiped away, implying that she lives in true terror every day on the inside.</p><div class='title'><b>Two Sides</b></div><p>Both endings show the duality of the situation. Refuse the wedding and defeat the part of you driving you towards it. Or accept the wedding and defeat the part of you driving you away from it.</p><p>By refusing the wedding, Hinako breaks away from her father's control, and puts her with Shu. She didn't want to get married, so Ending 3 should be a good ending. But the outside world shuns them. The game portrays the two of them running away into an uncertain future as hopeless and pessimistic. What future would they have by abandoning everyone they know? The fog turning poisonous and devouring the lives of everyone in town furthers this idea.</p><p>On the other hand, by accepting the wedding, everyone on the outside is appeased and happy. Hinako's family is now rich and debt free. Ebisugaoka looks bright, and Hinako's friends seem like they could live their best lives without her. Shu gives his blessing, and society continues to run and operate as it always has. Sounds good! But on the inside, society continues to rot and women live in fear.</p><p>What's the alternative? <b>Choice</b></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201070842_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In all three endings so far, Hinako's choice has never been respected. She turns violent from the pills Shu slips her. She is forced to marry without a say. And by rejecting the marriage, she gives in to Shu, and is forced to cut ties with everyone she knows in Ebisugaoka. Ultimately, she never has a choice and has to comprimise her future either way. Once again we return to the theme of forced decisions on women in Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Choice (Ending 4)</b></div><p>Both Ending 2 and 3 make one of Hinako's sides the enemy. She's either the protagonist or the antagonist. By throwing away both the sword and the brooch, you aren't choosing to follow one side or the other. You are putting trust in yourself.</p><p>Now when you face yourself at home, you listen to each other. You speak with your sister, and she listens and begins to understand your position. You listen to your mother and understand there are more dimensions to marriage. And your father begs forgiveness.</p><p>Society places the burden of forced decisions and roles on everyone. Men are also forced to act in certain ways to appear "strong" in the eyes of others. A father must assert his dominance. While this idea is true even in modern Japanese society (I have stories about this), I think it undermines the fear and abuse her father has caused. Hinkao can't forgive her father, but she recognizes that at least he respects her now.</p><p>Leading into the end, Hinako realizes her situation fully. She says, "One of them wants to marry me off. The other wants to stop the wedding. Both of them are pitting me against myself. I will never be someone's puppet."</p><p>By refusing Shu's red pills, by purifying the sacred sword, and by rejecting the fox brooch, you are able to see both forces driving your two halves against each other.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201161553_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the etheral plain, the gods having been using you for their own purposes. The Tsukumogami wants revenge on the Inari. The Inari wants its wedding to retain their power. </p><p>The nine-tailed fox adds the final piece connecting the Inari faith to the Tsuneki family. "Once in a blue moon, humanity will produce an extraordinary girl with divine power. When that happens, a spell is places on our clan's successor that stirs in him a desire to make that girl his wife."</p><p>The fox wedding acts like a blood sacrifice. By joining the Tsuneki family to a girl of extraordinary rare blood, the fox gods are delighted and their power and influence grow. It's also noted that with this blood sacrifice, the woman is drained of all her blood, and her lifeless corpse is set adrift in the river as a means to bolster the imprisonment of the water dragon. </p><p>As both true Hinako and fox Hinako, you fight and defeat the Tsukumogami and Inari gods on mirrored plains of existence, ultimately proving that you are no one's puppet. Your life (lives) is your own.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201212309_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After the battle, even though Kotoyuki was under the influence of the fox spell, he ponders whether his feelings for you were real. And he vows to live his life and explore those feelings completely. He later writes you a letter saying that he is happy reliving a childhood he abandoned and still thinking of you.</p><p>You return to the real world in an abandoned Ebisugaoka covered in fog. In the end, Kotoyuki inspires Hinako. She wants to love someone as intensely as the love he showed for her. And if that someone is Kotoyuki in the future, then so be it. On the other hand, she wants to find her own passion, likes Sakuko's passion for her faith and Rinko's passion for Shu.</p><p>But with the halves of yourself wandering the silent streets of Ebisugaoka, you want to focus on yourself. The town is now quiet and free of anyone telling you how to live, how to act, and how to be. You are free with yourself in your own <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201181705.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201181705.webp">Silent Hill</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/silent_hill_f/SILENT_HILL_f_20260201213455_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a pretty beautiful ending.</p><p>On the surface, having defeated both gods protecting the town from the water dragon, it was released leaving the noxious fog to cover the town completely, forcing everyone to leave. Or also, with the town abandoned, all gods have lost their power, leaving fog to cover the town. Either way, only the water dragon remains and no one prays to it.</p><p>So many mountain villages and settlements in the Japanese mountains have met a similar fate during the post-war Showa era. People leave their homes to find a better life in the now growing cities, and the original spirits of the mountain reclaim their land.</p><p>Through all of this myth, legend, and history, I think Silent Hill f is an incredible work of art that highlights many fears and problems with old Japanese society. Some of those problems still linger in their culture today.</p><p>But, the game also gives hope for change. In the end, Hinako's father recognized he needed to respect his daughter. There are many families in my small town in the mountains where it seems like the father loves running around with their kids. Not many seem to follow the stoic Japanese father stereotype of the past.</p><p>I would say the biggest problem with the game is that these layers are hidden behind a second and third playthrough. People will probably never see these ideas for themselves, and rely on YouTube videos (or reading this post) which don't give a first hand experience.</p><p>I hope more people find this game for themselves. :)</p><p>(Below are many screenshots I took during my playthrough. I played using HDR so many screenshots were very dark. For those too dark, I increased their contrast and brightness to be more visible.)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kanjouji Park Observation Point 閑乗寺公園展望台" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kanjouji-park-observation-point">Kanjouji Park Observation Point 閑乗寺公園展望台</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's a really eerie feeling looking at a view that seems like October or November when we're in the middle of January.</p><p>I stayed at the viewpoint for a while and watched as the orange hue faded into blue.

Both areas had flat plateaus among the sharp cliffs, forests, and tough ground, which made them sustainable enough for people to live.</p><div class='title'><b>Tochihara <span class='ja'>栃原</span></b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6466_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After climbing up the cliff from the river on the west side, the area of Tochihara was quite wide. Among all the pocket neighborhoods and settlements of Toga Valley, it was quite populous with 217 residents in 32 households nearing the 1900s. As such, it was one of the first areas in Toga to get a branch school. Tochihara Branch School <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span> was established in 1902 and stayed in use through 1973.</p><p>Tochihara became abandoned in 1976, but the area came to life again as a ski resort and farms. In the 1970s, Japan looked for open land to convert into rice farms to increase production to match their population increase. All the original homes were removed.</p><p>Today, not much remains. The ski resort closed decades ago, and its final building was bulldozed last year. Digging and land moving equipment line the areas to quarry rock for construction projects.</p><p>It should also be noted that a small settlement known as <a href="/old/v7/shimobara-winter-branch-school" title="/shimobara-winter-branch-school">Shimobara</a> sits at the foot of Tochihara's cliffs, and is directly opposite from the river of Kitahara. Perhaps ironically, it seemed an annex of Tochihara in the beginning, but these days its the only place where people still live.</p><div class='title'><b>Kitahara <span class='ja'>北原</span></b></div><p>Compared with the west bank, Kitahara on the east side has gotten more activity in recent years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6374_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Toga bridge was completed 8 years ago, and it literally bridges the Kitahara neighborhood on the east bank to the west bank. It's a huge towering structure in the middle of seeming isolation, which seems weird considering hardly anyone lives in Kitahara.</p><p>It's ultimate purpose is to lead traffic to a tunnel. The tunnel is currently under construction but when it's complete, it will bring people directly to the heart of Toga Village. Travel will be far more direct and safer in winter because of it. No idea when the tunnel will open but looking through Google Maps, construction on the bridge began nearly 13 years ago. Sometimes Japanese rural development is measured in decades.</p><p>For now, the bridge allows quick access to several hot spring hotels and guest houses.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6422_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Originally, getting to Kitahara was not easy. The main route along the Sho River is on the west bank and Kitahara was on the east. The Sho River is very wide and deep, and the river banks have never high cliffs, so people could not easily go across. To the north, the Toga River splits from the Sho River, but the cliffs were still pretty steep. The original route to Kitahara had people cross the Toga River further south, and then climb over to the mountain to reach the area.</p><p>Despite the difficulty in getting to Kitabara in olden times, many of the residents found the natural hot springs of the area incredibly soothing and relaxing. In winter especially, the hot waters helped keep everyone warm inside.</p><p>Today, there are still a few guest houses with onsens. The most impressive of these is an onsen hotel named Kitahara Sou <span class='ja'>北原荘</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6274_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hotel was established in 1985 in an effort to revitalize the area. This was a decade after most of the residents had moved away. It has over a dozen full guest rooms and some banquet halls. Seems perfect for an office weekend retreat. The hot springs are separated for men and women, and both have an indoor bath and outdoor bath. I went here on a Sunday, and the baths had several patrons, so I couldn't sneak any photos inside.</p><p>The baths were really nice, though. I sat outside in the heated bath, and could contrast between the 40 degrees of the pool and the 2 degress of the air. Unfortunately, I stayed in the pool a bit too long and started feeling dehydrated. I should've snuck in a large bottle of water.</p><p>The water felt nice, and much of the hotel felt cozy. But peeking down the halls and looking into a few rooms felt very narrow and confined. In some ways, I felt trapped. It was a weird feeling that I hadn't really felt from any of the other remote places I've visited. Are there any Yokai that make you feel this way?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6309_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I didn't explore too much on the inside (I didn't want to burst into someone's occuppied room), but I looked around the outside. Japanese architecture in the 1980s was so fun and dynamic compared to the straight lines we have in buildings today.</p><p>Further up the road, past Kitahara-so is a guest house named the Toga House <span class='ja'>利賀之家</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260118_kitabara/IMG_6322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was currently closed, or maybe only open through reservations. Next to the Toga House was the original site of Kitahara's branch school. The Kitabara Branch School <span class='ja'>北原分校</span> was opened in 1902 with Tochihara's school, and was used through 1971. By then, there was an automobile bridge crossing Sho River, connecting the two sides, so any students living in the area could take a bus to school.</p><p>Stays in the guest house are 7500<span class='ja'>円</span>, but that includes dinner and breakfast, plus use of their onsen. Some day, I would like stay there. Although, Toga valley is full of interesting guest houses with unique histories. There's another place I would be more interested in staying.</p><p>Kitahara is a pretty remote place, but on this Sunday, there were more tourists around than I was expecting. Young folks and families stopped at the bridge to take photos. A few families stayed at Kitahara-so. And the river cruise on the Sho River was packed all day.</p><p>Even though Toga Valley and Village has been bleeding a slow death over decades, there is still a market for tourism in its beautiful nature. Maybe that Toga tunnel will bring more folks into the village center, and bring money and tourism to town.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Most Played Games in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/most-played-games-2025">Most Played Games in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 14, 2026 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year, my gaming habits compared to recent years and continued moving away from Twitch and away from Pokemon. I spent a lot of time playing a few singular immersive games and working on gaming related projects. I also spent a lot of time exploring Japan, taking photos, and writing about the adventures, getting away from gaming screens.</p><div class='title'><b>Modded Consoles</b></div><p>I think I'm most proud of the work I did on Gamecube and Dreamcast. After putting together a soft-modded Playstation in 2024, I wanted to have access to more games of that era. Many Gamecube and Dreamcast games were available on Playstation, but they weren't the same. Plus, they had tons of unique games of their own.</p><p>I ordered all the parts in January, but my consoles were back in the US. It wouldn't be until summer that I was able to retrieve them. In October, I finally put together <a href="modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="modding-a-sega-dreamcast"><b>my Dreamcast</b></a>. And in November, I put together <a href="modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"><b>my Gamecube</b></a>. Both of them came together like a dream.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I haven't had time to fully play any games on these consoles, but one of these days, I'd like to go back to Zelda on Gamecube, and some of the other goofy games on Dreamcast.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p>Outside of projects, I spent the most time on Playstation.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/ps_2025_games_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My biggest games this year were those top three: <a href="ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions" title="ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions"><b>Ghost of Tsushima</b></a>, <a href="/old/v7/horizon-forbidden-west" title="/horizon-forbidden-west"><b>Horizon Forbidden West</b></a>, and <a href="/old/v7/assassins-creed-shadows" title="/assassins-creed-shadows"><b>Assassin's Creed Shadows</b></a>. Each of these games had a full immersive and expansive world that was fun to explore, for the most part. </p><p>Ghost and Shadows were the most similar of the three. Both took place in fuedal Japan during pivotal moments in history that their stories built from. It's interesting how Ghost was basically a "good" Assassin's Creed game, so the franchise came back with a game that rivals it. Both games have strong points in different categories. Ghost has far more thoughtful gameplay and story. Shadows has a more expansive world and relateable characters. Ultimately, I far prefer Shadows for its exploration and beautiful scenery. Also, Ghost constantly throws sadness, rape, and death in your face which turned me off.</p><p>After being disappointed with Ghost, I bought a cheap copy of Horizon and I was very surprised and delighted. Horizon was an amazing experience that learned a lot from its first title. It's interesting how over the course of the long game, Aloy actually seems to grow and care about the new world compared to before. As such, I became interested in the other characters, too. Hopefully they'll be able to complete their trilogy without any compromises.</p><p>I also played through <b>Once Upon a Katamari</b> in a weekend. This was the first new Katamari game in over a decade, and it was good! The new stages had a lot of variety and the settings were inventive. Unfortunately, I don't think they pushed creativity far enough. They should've added some totally new game modes, or a completely new unique graphical level.</p><div class='title'><b>Twitch</b></div><p>Earlier in the year, I was still streaming some games on Twitch, but after March, I quit. It wasn't fun anymore. Steadily, my gaming habits have returned to playing immersive and story driven content alone. When other people joined the stream to chat about unrelated topics or they aren't really following the same story or they complain about things, it was a distraction and took away from the experience. </p><p>That's fine for games like Pokemon where the story doesn't matter and Twitch is just chatting with folks. It's not fine for the immersive games I wanted to play this year. When games got monotenous, putting on a podcast or a movie was much more beneficial.</p><p>Here are my meager Twitch stats until I quit in March.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/twitch-recap-2025_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Speaking on which, there was a new Pokemon game this year.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_2.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_1.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/nintendo_2025_3.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The hours are midleading, though. My Switch was playing <b>Pokemon Z-A</b> for nearly 300 hours, but it wasn't me playing it. After buying <a href="/old/v7/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts" title="/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts">a controller with macros</a>, the game could play itself and hunt for shiny Pokemon on its own. There were several days where I left everything on while I went to work, and came back 13 hours later to discover all the shiny Pokemon that had spawned.</p><p>Unfortunately, <b>Pokemon Legends Z-A</b> was my biggest disappointment of the year. The game is absolutely bland. Coming from Assassin's Creed Shadows with its beautifully detailed lifelike scenery to this boxy mono-colored environment was so hard. Obviously, the Switch can't do the same detail, but Pokemon Z-A has no style or life in its art design. It's so boring.</p><p>On top of that, the story is repetitive and boring, too. I never once cared about anything that happened to any of the characters. Pokemon characters never really stand out as distinctive, and when Z-A puts them front and center, it really shows how flat they are. The plot and story progression follows the same boring predictable pattern throughout.</p><p>The worst thing about this is its name, Pokemon Legends. Its predecessor, Pokemon Legends Arceus, felt totally fresh and fun. And building lore towards the overall Pokemon franchise was so creative. Pokemon Legends Z-A does nothing for the Pokemon franchise other than bringing in more Mega Pokemon. Coming from the first game, it's one of the most disappointing Pokemon games of all time. Awful.</p><p>Also, I played <b>Tetris Effect Connected</b> and <b>Tetris Forever</b>, and both games are amazing. I never really connected with Tetris Effect before on Playstation, but the "Connected" release on Switch felt much better. I think I just needed to get past a lot of the early music in the game. Tetris Forever is an amazing interactive documentary of the game's history which is an absolute must-play.</p><div class='title'><b>Switch All-Time</b></div><p>The Nintendo Year-in-Review also had a section of most played games throughout the system's life. This was also revealed recently through one of Nintendo's apps.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_1.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/switch_alltime_2.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Not surprisingly, Animal Crossing is my all time most played game. There were so many days during Covid when I left the game running while I was trying to coordinate with folks online to buy items, or sell turnips, or buy turnips. Looking through that Nintendo app, I had a couple 18 hours days where the game was on, but I was doing something else.</p><p>Also, plenty of Pokemon and Zelda games on the list. Those are my most played and most owned Nintendo games of all time, so it makes sense that they would dominate the list.</p><div class='title'><b>Steam?</b></div><p>Also as a fun aside, after watching a YouTuber play through this fun highway creation puzzle game, I wanted to give it a try, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/steam_2025_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I really enjoyed my time with <a href="/old/v7/freeways" title="/freeways"><b>Freeways</b></a>. It's easy to turn on the game, and try to get through a puzzle or two while watching a TV show at the end of the day. It was also only $5! So cheap!</p><div class='title'><b>Xbox?!</b></div><p>As another fun aside, with Xbox basically going out of business in the next year, I downloaded my life time achievements stats from True Achievements. You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/xbox_alltime.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2025/xbox_alltime.webp">take a look</a>, if you'd like. Even though I bought a few Xbox One games and was close to buying an Xbox Series X two years ago, I haven't touched an Xbox since moving to Japan. My achievement story begins and ends with the 360.</p><div class='title'><b>Modded Console Future</b></div><p>Speaking of which, with the Playstation 2, Gamecube, and Dreamcast working perfectly, I don't have any immediately plans to do more modding. But, at some point, I would like to have a modded platform for Xbox 360 games. I have no idea what that would be. I have no idea how to mod an Xbox 360 in the same way I've done it for my 2000s era consoles. But, when I feel like I have more peace of mind, I might start looking into it. I feel like that's in the distant future, though, as I have so many other games I want to play first.</p><p>Also, modding a Wii or Wii U might come first. As much as I want to replay the Gamecube Zeldas, I really want to try Wind Waker HD on the Wii U.</p><div class='title'><b>Gaming in 2026</b></div><p>For this year, I hope to spend more time with my Gamecube and Dreamcast. I would love to replay Twilight Princess. Also with the VMU Pro, I want to try and play through a game that fully uses it. There are also more immersive games that I skipped in recent years. I want to play through the Alan Wake games. I also want to play Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2. I continually check Yahoo Auctions for cheap used copies.</p><p>Also, the Super Station One is currently shipping. Maybe this will finally get me to go through Ocarina of Time, and maybe play Majora's Mask for the first time. Another playthrough of Snatcher could be fun, too. I could actually take a ton of screenshots this time. Also, there's the recent Super Nintendo MSU version of Castlevania II with the Disk soundtrack.</p><p>Too many games. Too many hopes. I will probably just buy Death Stranding 2 and lose myself in it for a month or two.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Toga Valley 利賀谷 and Past Schools" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/toga-valley-and-past-schools">Toga Valley 利賀谷 and Past Schools</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The five valleys are Akao Valley <span class='ja'>赤尾谷</span>, Kaminashi Valley <span class='ja'>上梨谷</span>, Shimonashi Valley <span class='ja'>下梨谷</span>, Otani Valley <span class='ja'>小谷</span>, and Toga Valley <span class='ja'>利賀谷</span>. I talked about the history of Shimonashi Valley little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">post about Hosoo Pass</a>.</p><p>Four of the five valleys follow the Sho River, which comes from the east side of Mt. Haku going directly north into the Sea of Japan. Toga Valley is different because it follows two different rivers. The Toga River comes from further east to join the Sho River at the base of the mountain. It also follows Momose River, which is further east and never joins either. As such, Toga Valley is almost completely cut out from the other four valleys and is far less populous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1830_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the river's edge meets the land, the forests begin. The whole area is over 95% deep forest. But, dotted along the cliffsides were several pocketed settlements back in the day with larger clusters up the mountain forming small villages of Toga, Sakagami, and Momosegawa. In 1896, the gun-district system was established which classified the entire Toga Valley as a single municipality, Higashi Tonami-gun Toga Village <span class='ja'>東礪波郡利賀村</span>. The entirety of Toga Village covered 176 square km.</p><p>As its peak in 1947, the overall population of Toga Village was 4663. (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>) Today, it's around 400. It suffered the fastest rate of population decrease in Toyama prefecture in 2010 (-23% in 5 years), and it is one of the most depopulated areas in Japan. Because of that, there are a lot of abandoned buildings, including entire areas which no longer exist today. Last year (summer 2025), I visited the area 4 times because I was interested in the area's old schools.</p><div class='title'><b>History of Toga Schools</b></div><p>The first school built in Toga Village was <b>Shimo-Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>下利賀尋常小学校</span> in 1892. This was 6 years after the Japanese government's executive order of primary education in Japan <span class='ja'>小学校令</span>, which ultimately stated that all children were required to attend and graduate 4 years of elementary school. With Toga Village established in 1896, the school was renamed to <b>Toga Public School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀尋常小学校</span>.</p><p>Toga's biggest problem was distance. Toga village began where the <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> branched from <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span>. Toga River travels over 40km up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam, which forms a lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. But, Toga Village also included around 10km along Sho River and the 20km stretch of the <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east to its source.</p><p>Every 2-5 kilometers along the rivers was a small settlement. 2km doesn't seem all that far today, but in 1900, there were no paved roads or cars. (Cars only debuted in Japan in 1898!) People in the mountains traveled by foot (or rarely by horse). It was impossible for young students in the distant settlements to make the daily trip to school. This trip was even more impossible in winter when snow falls and blizzards cut off settlements completely from each other. (Not to mention the dangers of wildlife and insect attacks.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_06_sorei/IMG_2422_t.webp" /></a></p><p>To solve the distance education problem, branch schools <span class='ja'>分校</span> were established. These were schools that branched from the main schools to treat students who lived in areas too far or too inconvenient away. They still operated under the jurisdiction of the main school but had their own branch principal and another teacher or two depending on how many students they had. Teachers couldn't be expected to make the daily trip to school either, so they lived in the school in their own living quarters.</p><p>In 1902, the first branch schools were established in <b>Tochihara</b> <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span>, <b>Kitabara</b> <span class='ja'>北原分校</span>, <b>Sennohara</b> <span class='ja'>仙野原分校</span>, and <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>. These were all areas near the base of the mountain. It wasn't for another 30 to 35 years before more branch schools would open to treat students who lived on the top of the mountain with <b>Mizunashi</b> <span class='ja'>水無分校</span> and <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>大勘場分校</span> branch schools, and another 6 winter branch schools would open for students who lived in between. I don't have all the data, so I think other branch schools opened in this time, too.</p><p>Ultimately, these were some of the most reglected areas in Japan for education. They didn't get money to build enough schools to reach all children. Most teachers also considered being stationed in these branch schools as punishment, too, because they'd be completely cut off from their own families. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After World War II, education was restructured. All students were now required to attend 9 years of school. There was 6 years of elementary and 3 years of junior high schools. As the country rebuilt itself, it identified these remote schools as a problem and implemented the Remote Area Education Promotion Act (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E6%B3%95"><span class='ja'>へき地教育振興法</span></a>). More branch schools would be built in remote areas to obtain a near 100% attendance rate for schools. And, each remote branch school would now be given a grade (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E5%9C%B0%E7%AD%89%E7%B4%9A"><span class='ja'>へき地等級</span></a>). The Remote Grade ranged from 1 to 5 and is determined based on the distance from transportation, hospitals, post offices, and grocery stores. It's also determined by the distance from the main school, city center, and board of education. When a teacher is posted at a branch school, their salary would be increased based on the Remote Grade of the school.</p><p>From the educational restructuring in 1947, <b>Toga Junior High School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀中学校</span> would open in the heart of Toga Village. The graduating class was only 17 students. In 1948, branch schools for the junior high opened in <b>Sakagami</b> <span class='ja'>坂上分校</span> and <b>Momosegawa</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川分校</span>. The graduating class grew to 51 students. In 1949, more branch schools opened in <b>Okutaikanba</b> <span class='ja'>奥大勘場分校</span>, <b>Takanuma</b> <span class='ja'>高沼分校</span>, and <b>Shogawa</b> <span class='ja'>庄川分校</span>. The graduating class was now 92 students. Each of these junior high branch schools just used the existing branch schools, which were still used for elementary school students.</p><p>Population in Japan soured in the 1950s from 83.4 million people in 1950 and 93.2 million in 1960 (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population" title="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/jpn/japan/population">2</a>). However, Toyama Prefecture remained mostly stagnant going from 1 million people in 1950 to 1.03 million in 1960 (<a href="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015" title="https://nbakki.hatenablog.com/entry/Changes_in_Population_of_Toyama_Prefecture_1920-2015">3</a>). And Toga Village had began its sharp decline from 4,663 in 1947 to 3,562 in 1950 to 3,038 in 1960 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). </p><p>Throughout the decade, more branch schools would open to cater to those who couldn't make the journey in winter. By 1959, the number of schools in Toga Village was at its peak. There were 21 total elementary schools (1 main school, 11 branch schools, 9 winter schools) (<a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">4</a>), and the 6 junior highs (1 main, 5 branch). <b>Note:</b> Through Internet researching, I could only find 17 elementary schools.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1962, the dormatory at <b>Toga Junior High School</b> was completed. All distant students now lived at school, which closed all junior high services for branch schools. More and more branch schools continued to close throughout the 60s as infrastructure was built. Roads were paved connecting all the settlements and more people owned cars so they could travel easily. They could also plow snow in winter easier which closed a significant amount of winter branch schools.</p><p>Throughout history, the people in Toga have been pretty poor. The mountains were terrible for growing rice, so most people lived off of growing beans and buying food from selling silk and gunpowder. With the country booming, many families abandoned their old homes to move into cities where they could find decent work and make a much better living. This also closed many branch schools as their neighborhoods were vacated.</p><p>This continued into the 70s. Tunnels were built between the mountains connecting each of the valleys, and expanded motorways were built, too, to make daily travel very easy. In 1970, the population of Toga Village shrank to 1,961, and by 1980, it was 1,328 (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>). In 1983, the graduating class of Toga Junior High School was only 9 students, the lowest to date. (There were 17 students in the class of 1984, though.)</p><p>By the 1990s, most of the branch schools had either closed or left dormant. In 1996, all remaining branch schools were officially closed and the government sold the buildings to whoever wanted them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_10_toga/IMG_1540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1998, the above school was built, the <b>Toga All Persons School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀アーパス</span>. This huge building combined both Toga Elementary and Junior High together in a single building. There was also space for community classes, and had room for foreign students to study abroad from their sister city in Greece. Population of Toga was around 1,000 at this point and all students took the bus to school. Some students had an hour commute.</p><p>In 2004, there were municiple mergers across Japan and Toga Village folded into Nanto City which now covered all of Gokayama and the towns and cities creeping into the urban area of Takaoka. Population was 855 at this point. By 2015, there were only 18 total junior high students, and 16 elementary school students.</p><p>In 2024, both elementary and junior high schools combined into a single school called <b>Nanto City Toga School</b> <span class='ja'>南砺市立利賀学舎</span>. At the time, there were only 10 junior high students (among 3 grades) and 13 elementary students (among 6 grades). The graduating class was only 2 students. There was only one 6th grader and zero 2nd graders. (<a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15373/students.html">5</a> <a href="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html" title="https://www.gaccom.jp/schools-15181/students.html">6</a>)</p><p>Only 400 people live in Toga today and they're mostly elderly people. Not many young people live out here and there's really no reason. There's lots of construction, but those companies set up temporary housing for their workers in summer. Very few of those workers actually live in Toga. Historically, the area has been poor so there's not much value in living here.</p><p>Here's a full timeline of these events: <a href="/old/v7/toga-valley-timeline" title="/toga-valley-timeline">/toga-valley-timeline</a></p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley Schools, Settlements, and Neighborhoods</b></div><p>Again, Toga Valley begins where the <b>Sho River</b> <span class='ja'>庄川</span> and <b>Toga River</b> <span class='ja'>利賀川</span> join at the base of the mountain. Toga Village contains the first 10km along the Sho River, but the majority of the village follows Toga River up the mountain to Mizunashi Dam Lake <span class='ja'>水無ダム湖</span>. There's also the initial 20km stretch of <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span> in the east that runs mostly parallel with the Toga River.</p><p>In 2025, I went to the area 4 times and visited 14 of the old schools and settlements of Toga Valley. Let's look at each of the areas of Toga Valley in order from the base of the moutain.</p><div class='title'><b>Shogawa <span class='ja'>庄川</span></b></div><p>Shogawa is the first area at the base of the mountain, and its the first cluster of homes visited after leaving the flat lands of Nanto and Tonami. There was a branch school in this neighborhood, but it no longer exists today, and I can't seem to find any traces of it. I'm not sure when it was initially built, but it was probably in the 30s. It was used for Toga Junior High School from 1949 to 1962, and there's photo of it in the Anniversary book. (Also in 1952, the 4 villages north of Toga Village were collected together to form Shogawa Town, which isn't the same and makes searching more annoying.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260110_toga/IMG_5762_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are still several homes and businesses in Shogawa today including the Komaki Dam. 1.5km up river from Komaki Dam is where Sho River and Toga River join. From Komaki Dam, if you're on the west bank, you'll continue up the Sho River. If you're on the east bank, you'll follow Toga River.</p><div class='title'><b>Shimobara <span class='ja'>下原</span></b></div><p>Following Sho River, the first major neighborhood is Shimoboara. Shimobara's branch school first opened in 1935 as <span class='ja'>利賀小学校栃原分校下原冬季分校</span>, or <b>Toga Elementary Tochihara Branch School Shimobara Winter Branch School</b>. It was a branch school of another branch school. Later in 1976 when Tochihara Branch School was closed, it become a full branch school as <span class='ja'>利賀小学校下原分校</span>. It closed in 1986.

Tochihara had open areas along the valley which was perfect for farming. <b>Tochihara Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>栃原分校</span> was one of the first branch schools, built in 1902. Most people moved away by 1973, and the area became uninhabited in 1976, although the farms still remained and there was now a Ski resort, too. The branch school was officially closed the same year.

By 1975, the neighborhood still had 3 homes with 7 residents. (<a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">4</a>) But today, there is no one. Two buildings still stand, but probably not for long. </p><div class='title'><b>Taikanba <span class='ja'>大勘場</span></b></div><p>Nearly at the source of the Toga River, another 2km upstream brings us to Taikanba. Finding the history of this school is difficult because its name <span class='ja'>大勘場</span> is nearly the same as Okutaikanba <span class='ja'>奥大勘場</span>. I think some of the histories were mixed up.</p><p>Wikipedia says that Katsuaro Winter Branch School was a branch of Taikanba not Okutaikanba, so I think the Taikanba was out here in the 30s and 40s. Wikipedia also says the name <b>Taikanba Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>大勘場分校</span> was officially established in 1976 when Okutaikanba changed its name to Senzoku. So, that's inconsistent. It was closed in 1996. The area became uninhabited around 2012.</p><p>This was a <b>Grade 4</b> branch school, the highest grade yet. It's about 12.5km from Toga Elementary and nearly 30km from Komaki Dam.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1065_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Taikanba Branch School building is still here today and it still has power. I arrived around Noon o'clock and the Noon Chime began to play from the loudspeakers attached to the building, which freaked me out at first. The road behind the school leads into the old village, but all of the homes have now collapsed. Looking through Google, the last two homes only recently collapsed in the last 5 years.</p><p>Article and Photos: <a href="/old/v7/taikanba-branch-school" title="/taikanba-branch-school">/taikanba-branch-school</a></p><div class='title'><b>Mizunashi <span class='ja'>水無</span></b></div><p>500 meters past Taikanba, the road is closed. This is essentially the end, however, further past the closed gate, the road continues for another 10km to Mizunashi Dam <span class='ja'>水無ダム</span>, which is the source of Toga River. The whole area of mountain and forest is known as Mizunashi, and it also had a small settlement, which was another 5km going east from the lake.</p><p><b>Mizunashi Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>水無分校</span> opened in 1929. It began in someone's house until its own building was constructed. It was used until 1966 and closed in 1967. By 1970, all residents of Mizunashi had moved away. (<a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">4</a>)</p><p>Mizunashi was designated as a <b>Grade 5</b> remote school, the highest grade, and its easy to see why. It was nearly 30km further up the mountain from Toga Village center, and Toga Village was already 17km into the mountain from normal civilization. Even today, it would take nearly an hour to drive from Mizunashi to Toga Village. Now, it can only be accessed from Hida on the other side of the mountain.</p><div class='title'><b>Toga River complete</b></div><p>From the base of the mountain at Komaki Dam and traveling over 40km all the way to Mizunashi Dam Lake, there were 14 settlements and villages, each with their own schools.</p><p>Sennohara → Kurito / Wakidani → Takanuma → Sorei → Oshiba → Kitamamedani → Toga → Sakagami → Nakaguchi → Okutaikanba / Senzoku → Tanoshima → Katsurao → Taikanba → Mizunashi</p><p>Strings of villages through mountain valleys make sense when there's an eventually destination, like a large city on the other side of the mountain, but Toga Valley doesn't go anywhere. It's final destination is an artificial lake. The whole valley had poor soil and growing conditions, so the people living up here were always poor and occasionally starved to death in winter.</p><p>Maybe this was just a good area to get away from everyone. There were never any daily travelers (other than their neighbors), so people were able to live by themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Momose River <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span></b></div><p>Toga Valley was more than just Toga River (and the little bit on Sho River). Running parallel to Toga River to the east about 1.5 away was <b>Momose River</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span>. Momose River began on the west side of Mt. Kongodou <span class='ja'>金剛堂山</span> and continues around 20km until Yamada Dam, which is near Takanuma. The areas of Momose River didn't have as many people as Toga River, but the area was much flatter providing much better farmland, especially for rice.</p><div class='title'><b>Momosegawa <span class='ja'>百瀬川</span></b></div><p>Let's start with the neighborhood of Momosegawa. It's the central neighborhood of Momose River and it's directly east of Toga Village about 1km over the mountain. There was a path through the mountains for farmers to travel and sell their crops.</p><p><b>Momosegawa Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>百瀬川分校</span> opened sometime in the 20s and 30s. I don't know for sure. It was originally a large wooden building on the east bank of the river. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, this is all that's left of the original wooden building. Looking through Google Maps, every few recent years, it seemed like more and more of the building was removed, and now it's just this house with the side of it covered with a tarp.</p><p>In 1971, the school was upgraded to a concrete building, which was built closer to people's homes. It was used through 1989, then officially closed in 1996. Both old school buildings were used for Sake brewing after their decommission.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_9113_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I visited Momosegawa Branch School on June 7th.

I did notice that Kamimomose Branch School was a branch of Sakagami Elementary School and not a branch of the main school. Sakagami is about 2km west of Sakagami over the mountains, so I guess that was more convenient.</p><p>Article and Photos: <a href="/old/v7/kamimomose-branch-school" title="/kamimomose-branch-school">/kamimomose-branch-school</a></p><p>Today, the area of Momosegawa has a lot of camping grounds and recreational areas for retreats. They also have a yearly Photo Rogaining event!</p><div class='title'><b>Toga Valley</b></div><p>Overall, I find the area of Toga Valley fascinating. Its an area that seems like people have always struggled with money, food, and population. Only the areas of Momosegawa seemed fertile enough for large rice production, but there were so many other small pockets along the valley that continued to survive. Again, I'm not really sure why people lived so far up the mountain when there wasn't anything there.</p><p>Most settlements, villages, towns, and cities were built and grew from being on the way to the next big village, town, or city. Or people settled in an area that was abundant in some resource. Maybe the settlers of Toga valley were looking for riches in the mountain, but never found any. Or maybe they just wanted to get away and stay away from the rest of Toyama. Either way, once Japan modernized after World War II, families recognized there was no value and left.</p><p>Looking back at the population chart (<a href="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html" title="http://demography.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6443.html">1</a>), Toga Valley had a steady population of around 3000 until its spike and peak in World War II. That spike (4,663 people) is a little misleading as it wasn't natural population growth. During World War II, large Japanese cities were routinely fire bombed by the US, and Toyama City was the most devastated in Japan. The US even used it as practice for Hiroshima and Nagasaki launching 4 "pumpkin bombs" that destroyed 99% of the city on August 1st, 1945.</p><p>Many people moved their families into the mountains to avoid these bombings and this created a population spike in rural Japan. After the war and Japan was rebuilding, there were so many new jobs available in the cities, and neighborhoods were being rebuilt. There was no reason to live in the mountains anymore, and it was probably even sabotage if you stayed.</p><p>Even so, the old guard continues to hold their old homes in the mountain valley with seemingly no real hope for the future. Maybe once the tunnel opens it'll bring more people to Toga, and they could focus on more camping and leisure outdoor activities, like mountaineering and river fishing. I don't think Toga will ever fully go away when Toga Valley's nature looks so great.</p><p>All of the schools and abandoned villages I visited have been collected into singular posts. They were all linked throughout this post, but they have also been collected at this keyword: <a href="/keyword/toga" title="/keyword/toga">keyword/toga</a>. After researching everything, there are a few more new places I want to visit, and double check on a few old ones, so I expect that keyword to grow a little in the future. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mukodaira Observation Deck 向田平展望台" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mukodaira-observation-deck">Mukodaira Observation Deck 向田平展望台</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It sits on a long expanse of flat plain lands, which was very lucrative for people back in the day to farm and grow rice. And it became an oasis for people who wanted to get away from war and battles in the low lands.</p><p>Even though Takayama is in the mountains, these flat open lands are wide enough to get much more sun than all the other villages and settlements in the valleys. On average, the temperature is about 5 degrees higher in Takayama in winter making it more comfortable.</p><p>I always imagined the shape of Takayama like a dish, flat with curved edges. And you can totally see this idea take shape from the observation deck at Mukodaira at the south end of town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The homes and neighborhoods creep up to the very edge of the hills and mountains to take maximum advantage of the available space.</p><p>Here's a large panoramic photo I put together:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5881_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From up here, on the south end of town, you have a clear view of Miya River <span class='ja'>宮川</span> as it snakes its way through town. You can also see Takayama Train Line and Route 41 coming from the same area through the valley to enter in Takayama's south side. You can see some of Takayama's schools, hotels, the southside grocery store, and Takayama's only porn store still in business somehow.</p><p>Despite living here for 13 years, I did not know of this vantage point until I was searching around on Google Maps and noticed it. Getting there is a little tricky, though. In this area of town, there's a small road between the two houses in the bottom photo. Just follow that road up into the mountain. It takes about 10 minutes to reach an area to park. From there, it's a quick 5 minute walk to the observation deck.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5790_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can even see the observation deck in the photo on top of the short mountain. There's nothing else up here, though. There's no shrine or temple. Most mountains have a shrine or marker at the top for a local diety, but here there's nothing. The observation deck feels like an afterthought after plowing through the mountain to make towers for powerlines.</p><p>At the base of the mountain, though, is Wakamiya Hachiman Shrine. Some of the shrine members were clearing snow from the walkways and setting up for a bonfire in the evening.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/260111_takayama/IMG_5968_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On a clear day, Mukodaira is a fun quick trip to see the town from a different point of view. It's easy enough to get there that you could even make the trip at night.

After its release in January 2021, it became one of Lego's highest selling boutique sets of all time. It was a watershed moment where so many people were reintroduced to Lego and experienced how brilliant and clever their model design had become in recent years.</p><p>I bought <a href="/old/v7/lego-bonsai-tree" title="/lego-bonsai-tree">the bonsai tree</a> around 2 1/2 years ago, and it has steadily gotten me into buying more Lego sets to complement it. With the bonsai tree's popularity, Lego has continued to release more and more botanical sets. In August 2025, they released a new set of Lego bonsai trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5568_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Mini Bonsai Tree Collection. It was released in August 2025 for $65, a $15 increase from the original Bonsai set. This was around 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> for me. Ultimately, I try to avoid buying Lego these days because I can buy a lot of other things (toys) for 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> that won't just sit on my shelf. I could almost buy two full games for this price!</p><p>Leading into Christmas, Amazon had the set on sale for 6000<span class='ja'>円</span> and after building the <a href="/old/v7/lego-gameboy" title="/lego-gameboy">Lego Gameboy</a>, I wanted to add a little bit more flourish to the display on my shelf. So, I bought it. And then I also bought an LED light kit for it. (I always upsell myself on sets.)</p><p>The designers at Lego continue to impress with these trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5616_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They continue to be creative about reusing speciality pieces in new and unique ways. The original bonsai tree used pink frogs for cherry blossom leaves. The new ginko tree uses butterflies recolored light orange for leaves. The pine tree uses recolored green claws as needles. And the wisteria uses a gradient of combined flower pieces for its weeping flowers.</p><p>The building experience is also amazing. They reused the sloping technique from the original bonsai tree, so the trees stand at an angle. Each limb that branches from the trunk can be rotated and moved to create the exact density of foilage you want. Even though each pot is the same, they can be interchanged on the stands giving you the freedom to create whatever scene you'd like.</p><p>When looking at the trees from a certain angle, they look quite stunning.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5707_t.webp" /></a></p><p>However, as other reviewers have noted, when looking directly from the top, the models aren't so flattering. This is especially the case for the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5641.webp">black pine tree</a>. The leaves and needles only form a perimeter on the outside. Inside, there's nothing. It looks bad, but depending on how you display them, it probably doesn't matter.</p><p>Speaking of which, with these models complete, I could add them to my Gameboy display.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_5711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Great. :) I wanted to use the mini bonsai trees to add more color variety and density to the display, and they achieved both of those goals. It looks much better and more balanced now. (Although, the bonsai trees don't match the scale.)</p><p>But! There was still something missing. I bought a light kit for the Gameboy and when the whole scene is illuminated, these new trees don't do anything. All the focus is on the Gameboy. It's the centerpiece so, of course, it should stand out the most. But it shouldn't be the only thing that stands out.</p><p>So, I bought a light kit from Lightailing. I like their sets because they use custom LED Lego studs rather than adhesive strips of LEDs or singular LEDs you need to place inside of pieces. LED Lego studs are idiot proof and non-destructive.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6099_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lights do an excellent job of creating a mood rather than putting a spotlight on themselves. The ginko tree lights look amazing because the yellow glow isn't over powering. The green and purple lights look okay, but they do not complement each other. Too much contrast.</p><p>Construction was a bit annoying. My hands were too dry so I could not get a solid grip on the wires to guide them in the right spots. Also, the lights for each of the trees are connected together, rather than having separate lines. This means that you can't completely separate the trees from each other, and there is very little slack. The ginko tree and the wisteria tree are currently at their max distance apart. They can barely move without pulling the other.</p><p>Overall, they create the scene I was hoping for. Even by themselves, the trees and lights look great. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251224_lego/IMG_6066_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I wouldn't recommend anyone spend $65 on these Legos, but I don't think many people did. Again, I bought them on sale for 6000<span class='ja'>円</span> leading into Christmas, which is about $40.

I think the Showa period of Japan is fun to research and peruse as it contains so many building blocks that have morphed into today's capitolistic society. How were products advertised to people 60 years ago? What sort of products were people buying back then? It's interesting how something so sophisticated and advanced back then is mostly trash and garbage today.</p><p>The Showa Goods Museum <span class='ja'>昭和レトロ商品博物館</span> in Ome (west west Tokyo) focuses on the commercialism of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. It's not a very big museum, like other retro museums I have visited. There's only one main room, and it was lined with displays cases that focused on different categories of products, such as stationery, toiletries, medicine, cigarettes, coca-cola, games, and sweets. The entrance had display cases with candy, soda, and cameras.</p><p>After looking through all of the cases, I think my favorite product was a pair of upscale fancy face masks. I love the design of the man and woman on the cover of the box. In the 50s, this style was probably considered peak fashion. But now the colors have faded, the box is rotted and tore, and the mask looks like its about to fall apart. It's a real metaphor of fashion through the passage of time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Their replica movie poster paintings were their most prized possessions, though. Or maybe they were restored originals? They had a recent photo that showed a man painting them. (I did not read the fine print.) These posters were incredibly vivid and striking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, they had an exhibition room which focused on the Japanese folk tale, Yuki-Onna <span class='ja'>雪おんな</span>, literally translated as Snow Woman. There were diorama displays showing each of the key scenes from the tale, various copies of books that reprinted the tale, photos of an author, and some inspired art.</p><p>Almost all Japanese folktales, including Yuki-Onna, originated hundreds of years ago, so I don't think it really fit with the Showa theme. However, it is one of more popular tales and authors in the early 1900s (before Showa) wrote the modern version of it. Maybe it was super popular in Showa times.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Entry for the Showa Goods Museum was only 350<span class='ja'>円</span>, but you could buy a 500<span class='ja'>円</span> combination tickets for another museum just down the block, the Showa Gentou-kan <span class='ja'>昭和幻燈館</span>. Gentou basically means a slide as part of slide projection. The front face of the store sold headshots of many actors and actresses of the 60s and 70s.</p><p>The main part of Gentou-kan was a showcase all of this cat artwork, and the best part about the displays were the parody Kanban signs. I got photos of all sixteen of them.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the shop only had one small piece of merch connected to the signs. It was the Bread Kanban Sign, but they went a step further than the original by changing <span class='ja'>パン</span> (bread) to <span class='ja'>ニャン</span> (meow). I probably should've bought it, but I refrained.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall it was a cute museum, but it seemed far away from everything else. I don't think it'd be worth the trip on its own. But, if you were already in the area, I think the small 350<span class='ja'>円</span> entry fee is an easy sell.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kudou-teruhi-art-museum">Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.</p><p>I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum <span class='ja'>工藤耀日美術館</span> is such a location.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span> is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. </p><p>Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.</p><p>Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District <span class='ja'>須玉町小尾</span> part of Hokuto City <span class='ja'>北杜市</span>. When Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village <span class='ja'>増富村</span>. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town <span class='ja'>須玉町</span> with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.</p><p>Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.</p><p>Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.</p><p>Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. </p><p>He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤賢司</span>, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.</p><p>It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.</p><p>It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."</p><p>In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp">Michael Jackson</a>, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.</p><p>This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Entry was 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> and each book was 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. </p><p>I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.</p><p>This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.</p><p>While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane-in-2025">Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.</p><p>After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">I visited in 2013</a>, and both buildings were still standing. <a href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane">I visited again in 2015</a>, and the Junior High had been demolished.</p><p>It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp">the nearby construction sign</a>, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.</p><p>I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. </p><p>Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.</p><p>In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.</p><p>I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.</p><p>Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
