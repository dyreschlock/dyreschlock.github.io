| March 1, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Takayama is a city high in the northern Alps of Japan.  We are completely surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the country, but there are plenty more low lying mountains standing above us.  Towards the end of summer, I became interested in hiking some the nearby mountains, and seeing our town from above, and had plenty success.  I wanted to hike during the winter to see the seasonal differences, and yesterday finally had great weather to do it.</p><p>I decided to hike Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span>, a mountain I had already hiked once before on <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">September 20th</a>.  It's probably the highest mountain nearest the center of Takayama, and it has a great view of the Shingu <span class='ja'>新宮</span> neighborhood, and some of the downtown Takayama, too.</p><p>Harayama was one of the easiest hikes I did over last summer, and you can drive quite near the peak.  In winter, things were much different.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, with the heavy snow we received <a href="/old/v7/december-snow" title="/december-snow">last December</a>, many of the trees lining the mountain pass had collapsed, blocking the road.  It was completely blocked only 100 or 200 meters from Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨のさと</span>.</p><p>Several other cars had parked near the block, so I did the same.  I parked my car, and began my hike.</p><div class='title'><b>Walking to the Parking Area</b></div><p>I wasn't too worried since I had already hiked this area once before.  I knew the distance I needed to travel.  However, hiking in snow was WAY more difficult than I thought it would be, and there was a lot of damage from that December snowstorm that had not yet been cleaned up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I began by following the mountain road leading up to the parking area.  There was a path already laid out in the snow by previous hikers throughout the season.  A clear path of foot prints had packed down the snow, and created a frozen platform able to hold my weight.  Most of the time.  </p><p>Whenever I slightly veered off the course, I would sink in the unpacked snow.  Even sometimes the course itself wouldn't be able to hold my weight.  It would collapse, and I would sink in the snow.  Just like this:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was still deep enough to sink past my knees.  My typical pace would be walking, walking, walking, sink, walking, walking, walking, sink.  It wasn't so bad at first.  I would usually leap out of the hole while I sank, and catch my balance.  But after doing this numerous times, the exercise began to wear on me.  And every time I sunk in the snow was a short little break.</p><p>I took plenty of breaks taking photos, too.  Also, I probably stopped every 2 or 3 minutes, to take in the beautiful snow covered scenery and snap several photos.</p><p>There were plenty of downed trees as well.  The first couple of trees were easy to duck under, but there were several just too big to hop over, and difficult to tell if I could actually go under.  It can became very clear that this hike was not a simple leisurely stroll.  Several of these trees, I had to actually crawl under in order to pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In addition to the road, there were hiking trails that went the exact same direction and several times passed the road.  I was getting sick of sinking in the snow every 10 or 20 feet, so I changed paths to the hiking trails at my next opportunity.  The trails had slightly less snow, and nearly all of its had been very well packed down.</p><p>But, this presented a new challenge.  The snow was packed so well, and so uniform that was nothing for my shoes to grip.  And the hiking trail was MUCH more vertical than the mountain road.  Now, I was constantly slipping at the most modest of inclines.  Towards the end of the trail as it crossed the road again, I was basically crawling my way up, and tearing through the outer edges of the ice into the snow.</p><p>Ugh, fuck that.  I'm going back to the snow.</p><p>I was one leg away from reaching the parking area, and the shelter came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Things got way worse.  At this point, way more hikers had used the trail, so the path of the road was much more narrow and weak.  Nearly every five steps, I sank into the snow, had to pull myself out, and then sink again.  I was taking a break almost every minute due to exhaustion.  As exhaustion continued, I became too lazy or tired to keep myself from fully falling into the snow.  The snow was nice and soft. :)</p><p>But I continued, and ripped through the snow.  Another hiker came into view, and heard me crunching through the snow.  He basically just stood there and stared at me like I was some kind of idiot as I continually sank in the snow, and running out of breath.  I said <span class='ja'>こんにちは</span> to which I received a belated response.  Then he talked with me for a little while.  We had actually met before.  He worked at City Hall, and we met at one of those social events they have.  I didn't remember him at all.</p><p>He asked what my destination was, and I replied <span class='ja'>たぶんここです</span> (maybe right here), but then later said I was planning on going to the summit.  He had just come from the summit, and said it would probably take about 30 minutes.  Yeah well, it had already taken me 40 minutes just to get here.  I guessed that with the current season, maybe 50 minutes was more accurate.  I mentioned I had hiked here before and knew the area, so while he may had tried to convince me to give up, he basically gave up, and wished me well.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing to the Temple</b></div><p>From the parking area, there are two paths to reach the summit: the high path, and the low path, the difficult path, and the easy path.  I took the low easy path.  During the summer, the high path was annoying.  I couldn't imagine how painful it would be now.</p><p>The low path leads directly to the Kannon Temple where they do the horse paintings near the end of summer.  From there, it was a straight descent to the summit.  The descent worried me, but covering over a kilometer on level terrain, then putting all the bullshit at the end seemed easier to tackle.</p><p>I put on my gloves, and continued forward.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several ups and downs, and I sank in the snow fairly often, but it wasn't that bad.  It was no where near as exhausting as that last leg of the climb up.</p><p>Plenty of downed trees covered the path, so several times I had to get down on the ground at crawl through.  Many times I surprised myself with just how low I was able to go.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I mean, look at the trees in the above picture.  It looks totally impassable.  But just take one tree at a time.  Go up, go down, left, right, left, right, a, b, start.  And you're fine.</p><p>Man, this path seemed to take longer and longer.  Each time I reached a bend, I thought it would be the last, but it just turned around into more trail.  Several signs marked the path, and the distance continued to shrink.  800m, 550m, 300m.</p><p>Eventually, I reached the bend I remembered, lined with Matsukura-yama <span class='ja'>松倉山</span> flags.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the foot of the entrance was a running stream of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3902.webp">water to drink from</a>.

The first leg of the trail was another 40 or 45 degree slope.  I sat on my feet, and zoomed straight down.  Whee!</p><p>What probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to traverse earlier via the road, took me less than 5 minutes to sled down via the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty fun. :)  I continued sledding down the trails whenever I could.  After a while, the trails began to even out.  I was no longer able to sled, so I stuck with the roads, and keep on the icy path.</p><p>At last, I arrived back to my car almost an hour after I left the summit.  What took me 2 hours to climb, took me only an hour to descend.  Sure, I wasn't taking nearly as many pictures, and gravity was on my side, but that's still a huge gain in speed.</p><p>My gloves were completely soaked from the snow, and my inner clothes were completely soaked from sweat.  I brought some extra clothes with, so I changed into something dry before leaving the area.</p><p>Before heading to my appointment at 2pm, I drove through the Shingu neighborhood to take a reverse photo looking at the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's really not that much to look at from below, but from the top everything looks amazing.</p><p>The summit is that open area near the top.  The hill underneath also has a trail leading to the summit, but that was not the one I took.

The clouds, fog, and snow stop mid-afternoon, and sky opens wide to allow the sun to say goodbye for the day.  The other night, I noticed some rather bright objects in the sky.  Usually, if you have to see a "star" that is WAY brighter than most, it's actually a planet.  And it definitely was.</p><p>I was witnessing an uncommon event where our view of both Venus and Mars were coming close to each other, and eventually Venus would overlap Mars, blocking it from view.  In addition, our view of the Moon also comes close to cross paths with the two planets and almost overlaps their view.  This was last Friday night.  I wish I would've been setup for it.</p><p>Tonight was the first clear night since then, so I went to the top of Kita-yama around 6:45pm, nearly 2 hours after sunset to take some photos.  Something else celestial was happening at that time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The International Space Station</b></div><p>At exactly 6:45pm, the ISS came into view in the Northwest sky.  It raced across the sky.  Then it set in the South.  Ever since <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">the eclipse</a> last year, I signed up for NASA's Spot the Station service.  Here's the link: <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</a></p><p>Spot the Station was send you an email in the morning if the International Space Station happens to fly over head the coming night.  Just enter your email and location, and you're good for a year.  It's incredibly accurate.  It will tell you the exact date it will come into range, which direction in the night sky to look, and how long it will be visible.  Here's the email I got today:</p><p><code>Time: Tue Feb 24 6:45 PM, Visible: 5 min, Max Height: 55 degrees, Appears: WNW, Disappears: SSE</code></p><p>The station appears as a white dot in the sky and moves and a steady pace.  It makes no sound, and no visible trail.  You might think it was an airplane, but it's just a single light, and it's not blinking.  And then it disappears over some trees.  Gone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Moon</b></div><p>Luna is completely visible in the sky, too, illuminating nearly everything.

It takes about 2 hours to make it to the area, and between here and there are the western peaks of the Japanese Alps.  Half of the journey is using the smooth and fast Tollway.  </p><p>The second half is taking a narrow winding road that follows the outline of the mountains and the lakes and rivers their runoff have created.  On a chill clear February morning, it looks beautiful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For a couple of days this year, we've had this amazing clear weather with absolutely no clouds in the sky.  The sky a deep blue, and all the surrounding mountains completely visible.  At night, every star in the star can be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>We stopped twice to take some photos along the mountain road.

Kelly pointed out that kanji stands for 9 <span class='ja'>九</span> + Head <span class='ja'>頭</span> + Dragon <span class='ja'>竜</span>.  I'm sure some poet hundreds of years ago, thought the rivers and the waterfalls (at the time) looked like a 9 headed serpent, then gave the area this name.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We continued down the mountain.  We reached Ono, and headed north to the Dinosaur museum in Katsuyama City.

It's very easy to park and gain access.  Today it sits next to acres of farmland and rice fields.  Even back in the day, the setting would not be all that different.</p><p>It's unnatural.</p><p>Most Japanese castles sit on a mountain of rock laid by human hands, surrounded by castle walls and other towers and small buildings within the courtyard.  A castle isn't really a single building, but a center point of an entire complex, which, in turn, is usually the center point of an entire town.</p><p>The current structure labeled Katsuyama Castle is indeed unnatural.  According to the Internet, this is not its original location.  This building was built in 1992 by a successful and wealthy local who wanted to give something back to their hometown.  Apparently this whole thing cost around $70 million.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The whole thing is very ornamental, too.

It is MUCH closer to sea level than Takayama.  Takayama rests high up in the clouds amidst the mountains.  They don't look as dynamic because we are among them.  We live on a plateau.

It seemed like the art, the glamor and the flare was put front first, and the history that created these beautiful structures and the times they lived in were put second (or maybe even third).  The fourth floor has some history, but it was just some stuff loosely tied together with history.</p><p>I've been in castle museums before where the entire lineage of the castle owners were catalogued, and spread throughout the course of the museum, along with artifacts showcasing that history.  I've been in other castle museums which had tons of interactive exhibits, dioramas, and tons of history displayed and explained in ways meant to inspire school children into learning about the history of their country.</p><p>Katsuyama Castle just seems like some rich person's collection.  Their hobby.  I don't think Katsuyama will inspire anyone about the history, other than its looks.

| February 8, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I found a new hobby lately.  These toys are a pretty hot item.  Almost everywhere in the U.S., they are sold out.  Even the common ones can be tough to find.  And the uncommon and rare ones?  They sell pretty well on eBay.</p><p>In Japan, though...  they are not so scarce.  And after returning from winter vacation, I've been buying the ones difficult to find and reselling them on eBay.  An alternate title for this entry might be <b>Confessions of an Amiibo Scalper</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Amiibo</b></div><p>First, What are Amiibos?  Amiibos are these things:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are figurines of Nintendo characters created by Nintendo.  But in addition to being a figurine, each one has a chip in its based and can be used with various games on the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.  The most prominent game being the new Super Smash Brothers title.</p><p>The first wave of these figures was released in November last year.  However, given Nintendo's risk aversion and general misunderstanding of their demographic and fan base, they did not create enough figures to match demand, and certain figures became incredibly rare quite fast, and extremely difficult to find.  Additionally, this was on the heals of Christmas, so they became quite a hot item, and demand continued to increase.</p><p>That's in the U.S., though.  In Japan, most people don't care that much about video games.  The 3DS is pretty popular, and most kids have those.  But most families do not have home consoles because they're expensive, and take over the family TV which should be shared by everyone.  Also, kids don't really care about Smash Brothers.  They're more interested in Yokai Watch and Monster Hunter.  So, Amiibos aren't selling nearly as much as the states.  Also, I think they've shipped more in Japan, than in the states (at least per capita).</p><p>Before winter vacation, I spent some time reading about all the horror stories of gamers trying to get their hands on these things.  I thought, really?  A few weeks prior I saw a full display of (maybe) all the figures at a Toys R Us.  The prices on eBay seemed to corroborate with the stories.  Some figures were selling for 3 times their MRSP.  One in particular, <i>The Villager</i>, was closer to 7 times.  Amiibo figures retail for $12.</p><p>After coming back to Japan from winter vacation, I hopped on the Amiibo bandwagon purely to resell them on eBay.</p><div class='title'><b>Waves</b></div><p>At that time, there had been 2 release waves of figures.  From the first wave, <i>The Villager</i>, <i>Marth</i>, and <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i> were the uncommon or rare figures.  Though, I think <i>Samus</i>, and <i>Fox</i> are getting hard to find now.  From the second wave, <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> became quickly scarce.  <i>Captain Falcon</i> is starting to get rare, too.</p><p>In Tokyo, before returning to Takayama, I went to a few Toys R Us's and other stores, and easily found plenty <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I could not find any <i>Villagers</i>, though.  Those were actually rare in Japan, too.  After returning to Takayama, I found a <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Captain Falcon</i>, plus plenty more <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I've never seen a <i>Pitt</i>, either.</p><p>In January, Nintendo released their third wave of figures.  These figures would be released in the U.S. a few weeks later.  But, in the U.S., four of these figures were retailer exclusive, meaning you couldn't figure them just anywhere.  That was not the case in Japan.  These figures were <i>Rosalina</i> exclusive to Target, <i>Lucario</i> exclusive to Toys R Us, <i>Meta Knight</i> exclusive to Best Buy, and <i>Shulk</i> exclusive to Gamestop.  These seemed like they would be the most difficult to find in the states, so when they released in Japan, I bought plenty of each.  (Shulk has yet to release in Japan, though.)</p><div class='title'><b>Buying in Rural Japan</b></div><p>In large cities, you have tons of options, but out here in the forest and the mountains, the choices are much more limited.  Takayama isn't all that bad, though.  We have a Geo <span class='ja'>ゲオ</span>, and an Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span>.  Both stores have full displays of Amiibos and received full shipments of Wave 3.  Apita <span class='ja'>アピタ</span> has 'em, too, but seemed like they only received half a shipment of Wave 3.  That rental store in Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> occasionally has some, too.</p><p>Here's the display at my local Edion, taken on Sunday.  They had plenty of the common figures, and a few of the uncommon ones.  This is in STARK contrast to any shelves in America where only <i>Peach</i> can easily be found.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This weekend, I decided to drive around the Hida <span class='ja'>飛騨</span> area and raid all the stores for their rare and uncommon Amiibo figures.  I drove south to Gero, then west to Gujo, and quickly further south to Seki.</p><div class='title'><b>Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span></b></div><p>Still within the Hida region, comprising the southern towns and villages is Gero City, with Hagiwara <span class='ja'>萩原</span>, and Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span> being its population centers.

I would love to see a chart of my highs and lows throughout the past decade.  At one point, I was selling so many things that I actually became a top seller. It didn't last long since my supply was never all that large.  I was only a top seller for 3 months (2 of which were the grace period at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I should easily top $10,000 by the end of the week.  Also, I'm getting pretty close to Top Seller status again thanks to Amiibo.  Whee!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Nintendo 3DS" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-nintendo-3ds">New Nintendo 3DS</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 31, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After thinking about things quite a bit, I finally decided to buy a Japanese Nintendo 3DS XL.  One of the "New" ones, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were plenty pros and cons I've dealt with for a while.  For the record, the Nintendo 3DS is a region locked system, so I'm unable to play Japanese games on my American 3DS.  Likewise, I cannot play my American games on this one.  Nor, can I really exchange data of any kind between the two handhelds on a system level.  Though, nearly all games internally don't care about exchanging data.</p><div class='title'><b>The Cons</b></div><p>I had two big reasons that kept preventing me from outright buying this for a while.  One was the lack of games.  Any 3DS game I was interested in was almost guaranteed to make it to the U.S.  So I could simply wait, and buy it later.  The second reason was the language barrier.  Even if there were a game I wanted that didn't make it to the states, it would mostly likely be story-based or have mechanics where not totally understanding the language would get in my way.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>I continued to think more and more about that second point.  Everyday I deal with problems learning Japanese, and effectively communicating with those around me.  It weighs on me most days.  When I get home, I want to relax and just turn everything off in my head.  I usually do this by playing games, and I don't want to see anymore Japanese while I'm basically trying to get away from it.  Sometimes there's just too much being shoved into my brain at once.</p><p>Other foreigners living here face similar problems.  It continually builds and builds until you NEED to get out.  You need a break, a vacation.  Going back home over Christmas really let me recharge.  The same with visiting Okinawa last year.  I guess it's technically being "Home Sick" but it's not really that I want to go back home.  I just miss the variety, or the ability to actually understand people, and be effective in society.</p><p>Anyway, I just got back from vacation, so I've been recharged.  And many of my recent clashes with Japanese have turned out somewhat successful.  I'm using Google Translate FAR LESS on webpages these days.  When talking with other teachers, I rarely need to pull out my dictionary.  And with the Japanese I'm studying, I'm able to consistently read things and only misunderstand a few vocabulary words.</p><p>I am improving and am getting better, even though I'm still terrible at it.  So, the thought of having to tackle Japanese in games, and for fun, no longer seemed like con.  Really, it was now a reason <b>for</b> buying it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Pros</b></div><p>Having another venue for studying and practicing Japanese now joined my list of pros, which was really just a list of games I wanted to play.  These games include <b>Game Center CX 3</b>, <b>Yokai Watch</b>, the <b>Picross</b> games that haven't come to the U.S., and the eventually 3rd Gen VI <b>Pokemon</b> game, whether it be Pokemon Z or Pokemon Delta Emerald.</p><p><b>Yokai Watch</b> is massive in Japan right now, and I have no idea (really) what it is.  I've read some articles about people explaining it.  I've read the wikipedia page about it.  And read a few other things, too.  From what I gather, it's a multi-media marketing machine similar to Pokemon.  Eventually, the whole thing boils down to the core video game, and a complementary anime.  Really underneath all the bullshit Pokemon has, it's a solid game, and people claim Yokai Watch is, too.</p><p>So, people think Yokai Watch is actually good, and I want to know more about it.  It is coming to the U.S. this year, but I want to learn about it now, and also attempt to do it in Japanese.</p><p>Also, another reason I wanted to buy it is that I actually want an upgraded 3DS.  I play my Nintendo 3DS a lot, and the updated hardware has a lot of great stuff.  The Circle Pad pro is built into it.  It has a faster processor.  The 3D is better.  It's a great update.</p><p>So, I bought it. :D  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>I took a couple photos comparing the new 3DS XL to the previous 3DS XL, plus my DSi and DS Lite, since I have those.  The 3DS game goes in the bottom now, which is kinda weird.  Same with the stylus, which I don't like, but whatever.  Additionally, you need to unscrew and remove the back faceplate to get to the SD card slot.  It's annoying, but really only needed to be done once ever.  It uses a Micro SD card now, as well.</p><p>But it feels great.  The D pad feels amazing.  The buttons feel amazing.  I haven't used the right Circle pad much yet.  There's almost no tactile feedback with that at all from what I've messed with.  In game, I'm sure it's much better.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>Also, language-wise, it has been very gratifying and confidence building how I've been able to go through menus, sign up for things, and generally understand everything that I've been doing.  The language has not once gotten in my way.</p><p>I have yet to delve into Yokai Watch, but <b>Game Center CX 3</b> is excellent so far.  And, again, I've been able to understand what has been going on in the game.  I know what the characters are talking about.  In some cases, I understand the conversations completely.  The language has not been a crutch, what-so-ever.</p><p>Though, everything is still quite within my wheel house.  I already understand the menus, and Game Center CX from using and playing the English language equivalent.  I have not done that with Yokai Watch, so that game should actually challenge my understanding of Japanese.</p><div class='title'><b>Club Nintendo Picross</b></div><p>On the digital side of things, I purchased nearly all the Picross games available on the eShop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" /></a></p><p>With my current catalogue of Japanese 3DS games I had exactly enough points to purchase Club Nintendo Picross.  Game Center CX gave me 30 points.  Yokai Watch gave me 20.  And each of the 6 Picross E games were 5 points each.  80 points exactly!</p><p>It's really odd that this game using the Picross DS "engine", rather than the upgraded Picross E.  Overall there's like 180 puzzles in the game, including 2 Mega Picross puzzles.  I wanted to make sure I was able to get this game before Club Nintendo shut down for good in the next few months.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get Club Nintendo Picross Plus, which was a Platinum reward last year, but I'll take what I can get.</p><p>For the <b>Picross E</b> games, only the first 3 made it to the U.S.  There are 3 more that came out in Japan just this past year.  Picross e6 just came out last month.  In addition, there's a second Picross Gameboy Virtual Console game only in Japan.  Whee, Picross!</p><div class='title'><b>Plenty to do</b></div><p>Well now I have plenty of new games to play, and also can actually take part in more Japanese games.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-end-2014-additions">Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 3, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Another year comes to close, and it has been another lucrative year for the team at Cards Against Humanity.  They've released quite a bit of new content.  At <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">PAX East</a>, they released a few new booster packs.  At PAX Prime, they released their fifth expansion.  And with Christmas passed, their new holiday expansion is now complete, too.</p><p>I'm back in the states for Christmas, and I'm able to catch up with the recent (and one not-so-recent) expansions of the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Reject Pack</b></div><p>The Reject Pack is an illusive booster pack of cards featuring some of the cut ideas for the original release of the game.  Not too long after the original release of the game, they began giving these out at various events, and giving them out as they fixed printing mistakes in their games.  They've never officially sold them, or even acknowledged their existence.</p><p>As I mentioned in that PAX East post, some company on amazon listed Reject Packs for $10.  Whether they were bootleg or not, that is absolutely the cheapest I have ever seen them offered online.  I quickly bought one, and this is the result:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cards look pretty damn good.  The card titles match what has been posted online.  I can't really say if the portraits and the reject icon are correct, but they're close enough for me.  </p><p>The card quality seems slightly cheaper than the cards offered in the fifth expansion, but the cards have the correct pressing texture.  Perhaps the quality is slightly lower because these were printed alongside the first versions of the game before the company was highly profitable?</p><p>I can't really say whether these are fake one way or the other.  They didn't come from CAH official, but there are no obvious flaws.  For me, though, they are certainly good enough to cross off my check-list. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Official Fifth Expansion & Crabs Fourth Expansion</b></div><p>More and more cards.  During PAX Prime, they officially released their fifth expansion.  A month later, Crabs released their fourth expansion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between these two expansions, you can observe the gap of humor between the official card writers at CAH, and the Crabs writers.  SO many of the Crabs cards are specific references.  Those kind of references you might find in an episode of Family Guy.  As if those kind of references are jokes in of themselves.  "Ze Germans"?  Oh yeah, I remember that from Snatch.  "www.clownpenis.fart"?  A reference to a hilarious SNL sketch, but not funny on its own.  The very last card in the expansion is a reference to Robin William's death..  </p><p>Many of the CAH cards don't really go into specifics.  They allow the audience and the players to make those connections on their own.  Really, that's the core of the humor in Cards Against Humanity.  These Crabs cards really miss the point.  They've really always missed the point.</p><div class='title'><b>10 Days (or whatever) of Kwanza</b></div><p>They did another holiday promotion in which CAH sent out several daily letters containing various things.  Each envelope detailed the story of Santa's death, and the great lizard uprising of 2352.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This year, there were a total of 11 envelopes.  The final present last year was a single white card with the recipients name on it.  This year, they got the individual cards out of the way immediately on the first day.  There was one white card, and one black card.  The second day contained magnetic stickers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The third, fourth, and fifth days contained the official 2014 holiday cards.

The ninth day listed all the campaign contributors to some nefarious congressman from the midterm elections.  The tenth day announced their purchased of a private island, and a deed for one square foot of land on the island.

I mentioned some of those in the previous <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">post</a>, but I'll reiterate.</p><p><b>PAX Panel Packs</b> are 2 sets of 10 cards offered only to attendees of the panels at PAX East 2014 and PAX Prime 2014.  During the panel, audience members offer suggestions for cards and the best 10 cards are printed overnight, and given the audience members the next day.</p><p><b>House of Cards Against Humanity Pack</b> was a promotional item offered by Netflix for the release of House of Cards season two, which happened in February 2014.  Netflix asked CAH to make some cards, and they created 25 cards: 9 black, 16 white.  100,000 of these packs were offered for free online, and sold out within 45 minutes after Netflix tweeted about it.</p><p><b>The Science Pack</b> is another promotional item put together by CAH for the Bay Area Science Festival.  They have mentioned this will be offered online sometime in 2015.  There are 18 cards: 6 black, 12 white.</p><p><b>The TableTop Pack</b> is a promotion for the indie web show Table Top, starring Wil Wheaton, apparently.  To fund season three they setup something on IndieGoGo, and CAH offered a pack of cards for the $20 mark.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>In addition to the above expansions, I also bought a second bigger, blacker box to house my growing collection.  As mentioned before, several cards in the original sets were designed to work well with each other, but with so many expansions and unofficial expansions, those connections are lost and diluted.  There are a lot of great cards added in the expansions, but I think there are more useless ones.  I need to pair down my collection and make a great solid set of cards.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's my current collection.  For now, I separated all the cards into 3 different stacks: original cards, official expansion cards, and the unofficial expansion cards.  I think that's the best way for quality control for the time being.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tokyo Skytree 東京スカイツリー" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tokyo-sky-tree">Tokyo Skytree 東京スカイツリー</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 30, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Before returning to the states for winter vacation, I stayed in Tokyo for a full day.  One of my only goals in Tokyo was to visit Tokyo Skytree with the amazing weather for the weekend.  I went there last year, but didn't take many photos.  I wanted to correct that this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tokyo Skytree is now the tallest free standing tower in the world.  Construction finished in late 2012, and it was built to accommodate the much wider-band television broadcasts for the high definition age that Tokyo Tower could not longer support.  As such, Tokyo Skytree acts as a symbol of the future.  The same symbol <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014">Tokyo Tower</a> was 55 years ago.  </p><p>Skytree reaches 634 meters into the sky, which dwarfs Tokyo Tower's 333 meters.  634 is very deliberate choice.  Using <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase">goroawase</a>, the kanji of 634 <span class='ja'>六三四</span> can be read as mu-sa-shi, which, apparently, is the old name for the neighborhood where Skytree stands.  Musashi is also the name of a famous samurai.  It probably has several other meanings, too.</p><p>I wanted to get there as early as possible, since the weather was supposed to get more cloudy as the day went on.  I left my hotel room around 7:30am to meet the 8:00 opening, but it took a lot longer to get there than I had thought.  I finally arrived at 9am, but it was still early enough to miss the crowds.  There was absolutely no line, which was astonishing to me considering the hour wait from last year.  I was in the observation decks by 9:10.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The first observation deck was at a height of 350 meters, already taller than Tokyo Tower.  The weather was starting to get cloudy, but the view was still amazing and clear.  In fact, if you looked towards the west, the weather was clear enough to view Mt. Fuji.  It was still rather feint, but totally visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Further up, there's a second observation tower at 450 meters, but there really isn't much difference between the two views.

The view from Tokyo Tower was probably amazing after its construction 60 years ago.  It's still amazing today, but many of the surrounding buildings have caught up to its height.  It's view is one amongst the city, rather than viewing it from above.</p><p>No other building in Tokyo comes close to the height of Skytree.  Every building is underneath its view.  So, It truly towers over the entire city.</p><p>The special observatory wraps around the outside of the tower with a slight incline.  You continue to climb until to reach the highest point in the tower.  Then it starts to decline back to the return elevatory.  I didn't spend too much more time in the tower after that.  On my way out, the place was completely packed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was at 11:00am.  When I arrived, two hours prior, there was absolutely no one here.  Maybe the shuttle buses didn't begin operation until after 9am or something.  I'm not quite sure why people wouldn't have come earlier to avoid this mess.</p><p>Outside, a few blocks away, I came across a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp">bootleg</a> merchandise shop.  Everything looked so cheap and crappy from the window that I did not inquire.</p><p>Anyway, there you go.  That's Tokyo Skytree.  It's pretty neat, though quite expensive.  Entrance is 2400<span class='ja'>円</span>, and an additional 1200<span class='ja'>円</span> to go to the special observatory.  I think it's worth it for a single visit, but not really for repeats.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sunset at Sunshine City 60" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sunset-at-sunshine-city-60">Sunset at Sunshine City 60</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 25, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been about a month, but on Nov 16th, I took and passed my Shodan level Kendo examination. :D</p><p>I wrote a little bit about this leading up to the exam on <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  Shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, or "first dan", and the first level of dan mastery in Kendo.  Dan mastery is somewhat similar to the black belt scale in Karate.  So, achieving Shodan is similar to a first level black belt.  There are no belts or additional decoration used in Kendo, though.</p><p>Prior to dan mastery, there is kyuu mastery, which is reserved for beginners of Kendo, usually elementary students, and beginning junior high students.</p><div class='title'><b>Examination Day</b></div><p>The test was held at Big Arena on Sunday Nov 16th.  The doors to Big Arena opened at 8am, and there were plenty of students waiting by the doors before then.  Additionally, there were basketball and table tennis tournaments held that day, too.  The Kendo test was held in the martial arts hall within the complex.</p><p>As the doors opened, everyone filled into the building.  I went upstairs and into the testing area.  Several of the beginner students I practice with were there taking the Kyuu tests for the first time.  One of my former students was there taking the "second dan" test, ni-dan <span class='ja'>二段</span>.  I had been practicing with him for the past month in preparation. :)</p><p>Everyone registered for their respective tests, and paid their fees.  The Shodan test was almost 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><div class='title'><b>Kyuu Examination <span class='ja'>級審査</span></b></div><p>The Kyuu-level tests began at 9am.  They first began with correct execution of the Kendo waza techniques.  These are a series of moves performed with another test taker.  One acts as the attacker.  The other as the defender.  Then when complete they switch roles.  These are performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span> (wooden sword), and without any protective gear.  The moves are performed in a deliberate and methodical way to correctly show one's understanding of how the move is to be correctly executed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" /></p><p>Secondly, the test takers are evaluated on moves performed in real-time.  These moves are performed with all the gear worn by the test taker, and with a shinai <span class='ja'>竹刀</span> (bamboo sword).  Same as the first test, test takers perform these moves on each other.  One is the attacker.  The other is the defender.  Then they switch.  Additionally, for "first kyuu", or Ikkyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span>, the test ends with both test takers performing as many moves as they can against each other in a "practice" match.  The lower levels don't require this.</p><p>As the different kyuu-level tests complete, the results are posted on the wall, the taker's kendo licenses are stamped and certificates are handed out.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Examination <span class='ja'>段審査</span></b></div><p>Once all the Kyuu tests were complete, then the Dan tests finally began.  I think our tests began 10:30.  There are 3 tests, and each is immediate elimination.  Meaning: if you fail a test, you do not continue.  I was most worried about the first test.</p><p>The first test is a practice shiai <span class='ja'>試合</span>, or match, but it's performed much differently than in a tournament.  In this match, when you meet your opponent, you carefully study their posture, their movements, and their feelings.  When you understand your opponent, then you can interpret intentions, and correctly strike and respond to their movements.  </p><p>My biggest problem with doing this part of the test is my bulky slow-ass giant body.  These junior high kids are way too fast for me.  For some students, I can see their attacks coming, but I can't parry and counter fast enough to make a valid strike.  Other times, I can't even see their attacks coming because they whip around their shinai so fast.</p><p>This test isn't about winning or losing, though.  Reading your opponent is certainly key.  But more important is that you follow through with your movements to completion.  At least, that's how I understand it.  I think there are other factors at play, too.</p><p>For this test, examinees perform twice against two other examinees, and each match is one minute.  That's it.  As usual, I was in the last group.  I took my turn, and performed the test as I understood it.  I was certainly nervous, but I had been practicing so much over the past 2 months, and regularly practicing with students of similar level that it really didn't bother me as much as it did during the previous test.  I knew what to do.</p><p>So, I passed the first part of the test without a problem.  I was slow a couple of times, but I guess I was sufficient where it mattered.</p><div class='title'><b>Part 2 and 3</b></div><p>After more than an hour lunch break, we continued the test with the reminder of the test takers.  All the kyuu-level examinees were already gone at this point, so the crowd of parents was pretty sparse.</p><p>Part 2 is correctly performing dan-level waza, which are higher-level kendo techniques performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span>.  I had been practicing these so much over the previous 3-4 months that they were completely internalized.  All the kendo instructors kept putting such an importance on them that I don't think I could ever forgot them.  During the test, though, we only needed to perform one side of the waza.  We were random chosen to either be attacker or defender, and that was it.  All examinees passed.</p><p>Part 3 of the test was the written exam.  This is what I wrote about before: <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  There are 4 questions total on the test chosen from a pool of 6.  Each examinee basically needed to memorize the answer, and write it down on the test.  You didn't need to write it in your own words.  And didn't need to write anything dealing with comprehension.  Only memorization.  (In my opinion, that doesn't really teach anything, but whatever.)</p><p>My written test was completely in English because I'm terrible at Japanese.  The English answers for the test were somewhat based on my translation of the booklet, too, so memorizing the answers was pretty easy (since they were written in my voice).  I was able to completely memorize the 6 questions within two days on the test.  Apparently, when grading my test, the proctor had commented that I had written everything 100% perfect.</p><p>So, I passed. :)  So too did everyone else that made it to this point.</p><p>I am one of perhaps ten or twenty foreigners to ever take and pass the Shodan exam in Gifu-ken.</p><div class='title'><b>Success!</b></div><p>I was rather nervous about whether I could pass the test, but a lot of that nervousness turned into confidence as the test drew closer.  I had been training every day leading up to the test, and was doing everything nearly perfect during practice.  My waza was totally perfect a few weeks prior to the test.  And I knew I could memorize the written part.  This was my third time taking a kendo exam, too, so I knew what to expect, and how to deal with things.  I didn't want to be too confident and have that turn to arrogance...  but I knew I could pass.  </p><p>Some of the student's parents were pretty confident I could pass as well.  They called the newspaper prior to the test so they could interview me and write an article about me.  The reporter asked me rather standard questions.  "How do you feel?" "How long have you done Kendo?" "Why do you do Kendo?" etc.  They asked my Kendo instructor questions as well.</p><p>It appeared in the Takayama newspaper the next day:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This brought me plenty of attention.</p><p>My student's parents read the newspaper, and noticed me.  The next day at school, all the students made comments about it, and congratulated me.  <span class='ja'>ジム先生、初段におめでとう</span>!  Some parents made their kids memorize their congratulations in English, and recite it to me.  Several teachers made a big deal out of it, too, making the whole class congratulate me before we started.  Plenty of students knew that I practiced and performed Kendo after school, but now everyone knew.</p><p>On Friday, a reporter from the Hida section of the Gifu newspaper wanted to write an article of their own.  They came to school, and interviewed me for about an hour.  She asked the same questions, but with more depth.</p><p>Again, the next day, it appeared in the paper:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between both these articles, I don't actually know the extent of what they wrote, since I'm terrible at Japanese.  It's also difficult for me to fully articulate myself when I can't do it in Japanese, and the person doesn't completely understand English.  As such, I don't think my responses were really all that interesting.  Nor can I really tell if they printed some shit about me.  (I did notice in the first article that I'm from Australia.)</p><p>This newspaper reaches A LOT more people than the Takayama paper.  Plus, it was the top story in this section of the newspaper, and it took up about a quarter of the page.</p><p>Now, everyone in my daily life knew that I did Kendo, and couldn't wait to congratulate me.  Teachers in other schools that I hadn't met, congratulated me.  The employees working at the convenience stores, grocery stores, gas station, and dry cleaning places I regularly visit, all recognized me in the paper and congratulated me the next time I went there.  Even the delivery man made a comment after dropping off a package.  <span class='ja'>いつもおめでとう</span>.  <span class='ja'>剣道をがんばってましょう</span>.</p><p>It wasn't that I hated the attention.  I mean, I already stand out quite a bit as a foreigner, which gives me attention on its own.  This is now yet another way of people paying attention to me.  Too much attention.  It was all positive attention, though, so I'm thankful for that. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Kendo continues to be amazing for me in Takayama, so I will absolutely continue to improve myself, and climb the rankings ladder.  After shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, the next level of mastery is nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span>, or "second dan."  The rules of ranking prohibit anyone from taking the nidan exam until one year after achieving shodan.  So, I won't be able to get nidan until November 2015.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, maybe 10 or 20 foreigners have gotten shodan in Gifu in the past.  Maybe 1 or 2 have gotten nidan.  None have ever gotten sandan <span class='ja'>三段</span> (third dan).  I don't think that's necessarily because of a skill-gap, or difficulty gap (though, I could be wrong.)  Nidan seems almost identical to Shodan, with the addition of more waza, and some different questions on the test.</p><p>I think the biggest gap is time.  Most ALTs only stay in Japan for 3 years at the most.  It's not that usual for someone to stay 4 or 5 years (which is the absolute max).  Between shodan and nidan, you must wait a year.  Between nidan and sandan, you must wait 2 years.  At this point, if I pass my nidan test next year, and stay for a 5th year, my sandan test would be after my contract is finished in Takayama.  I'm not sure where I'll be in November 2017, but it won't be Takayama.</p><p>I definitely plan on getting nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span> next year.  From there, I plan on continuing Kendo all the way up until I leave Takayama.  Hopefully where I am after, I will have the means to continue, then return to Takayama for the sandan test.  Who knows, though.  A lot can happen in the next 2 1/2 years.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/20">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/18">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
