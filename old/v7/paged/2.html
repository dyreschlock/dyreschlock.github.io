| December 2, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A month ago, a friend sent me a message about a Photo Rogaining <span class='ja'>フォトロゲイニング</span> event in my town. Photo Rogaining is a somewhat new sport that combines photography and running. It's like a photo scavenger hunt, except you are giving specific locations where to take the photos. The challenge is, by having no prior knowledge of the locations, you must quickly determine a route to reach as many checkpoints as possible, each checkpoint having different point values.</p><p>Prior to his message, I had no idea what this was. <span class='ja'>ロゲイニング</span>? I could not figure out the English word this was trying to be. Logging? Photo Logging? But, Photo Rogaining is the correct English. Rogaining as a sport began in Australia. Its first event was in the 70s. The name Rogaining comes from the 3 folks who invented it: Rod, Gail, and Neil. They just combined their names.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The full title of the event was <b>Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining - Celebrating the 500th Birthday of Nagachika Kanamori</b> -<span class='ja'>金森長近生誕</span>500<span class='ja'>年記念</span>- <span class='ja'>飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング</span>. Kanamori is a very special historical figure for the town. We have a statue of him in the Castle Park.</p><p>Head of the Kanamori Clan, Nagachika led his troops as an arm of the Tokugawa Clan and conquered northern Gifu and eventually Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui. Becoming the daimyo of the area, Kanamori transformed Takayama into a small-sized castle town to encourage tourism of other rich lords. He established what would become modern day Takayama. </p><p>So, the event commemorates the 500th anniversary of his birth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Takayama event was advertised around town a little bit. The starting point as well as the main venue was the Takayama City Historical Museum downtown. The poster had a link to the website for more information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/">https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/</a></p><p>There were 6 different categories of participants: Family Team, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team, Men's Solo, and Women's Solo. The event had a limit of 100 entrees, but we only had around 40 people total? A few didn't show up, but overall I don't think the event was advertised all that well. I'm really glad my friend sent me the info.</p><p>My friend joined a team with his daughter. There were 3 or 4 family teams. The biggest category was the Mixed Teams with 9 separate teams competing. The second biggest category was my category, Men's Solo. We had 6 individuals.</p><p>The schedule was as follows:<br/><b>11:00</b> - Reception<br/><b>12:00</b> - Start<br/><b>15:00</b> - Finish<br/><b>15:30</b> - Awards Ceremony</p><div class='title'><b>Rules</b></div><p>On the Japanese Photo Rogaining site, they listed some general rules. It was not exhaustive, so I didn't completely understand everything. Through the course of the event, I was able to understand the rules better, and now I have a much better grasp of what I could've done to place higher than I did.</p><p>Reception for the event was 11am at the museum. At check-in, we got our bib, number, and a packet with our map, which we were not allowed to open yet. Around 11:30am, they began explaining all the rules for the event. Again, I would've preferred they had all the rules clearly listed, so I could've double checked everything.</p><p>At 11:50am, 10 minutes prior to the start, we could open our maps and look at all of the objectives.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Several points on the map were ones I had guessed earlier, but I had no idea it would push out as far as <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kanon and Matsukura Castle ruins</a>. In reality, it's only 5 or 6km away. Normally isn't that far, but both of these are on the top of a mountain. Steep vertical ascents in a marathon are rough. On the other hand...  63 and 65 points are really high values, along with 43 and 47 on the way.</p><p>I didn't have a lot of time to think or compare this to the other points. I know that I wanted to climb up Shiroyama (castle park) for those points. So, my plan was to get some nearby points, go up Shiroyama for those points, and then push off west for Hida no Sato at least. On my return, I would keep north to grab all of those points before the end.</p><div class='title'><b>Start</b></div><p>As the event began, one of the Solo guys immediately bolted to the stoplight and then west. I kept up with him to the stoplight, but I was going east. </p><p>I grabbed a photo of the rock wall leading up the hill, <b>Point 1</b>, labeled as <span class='ja'>えび坂のお多福</span>. Further east, I snapped a photo of this small park, <b>Point 14</b>, <span class='ja'>川上別邸史跡公園</span>, Kawakami's Historical Second Home park?, on the way to the Bell Tower at Soyu-ji Temple, <b>Point 31</b>, <span class='ja'>宗猷寺鐘堂</span>. I snapped all of these in the first 7 minutes of the race.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>1 → 14 → 31 // (46 points)</p><p>Next, I wanted to climb Shiroyama <span class='ja'>城山</span> and get those points. Looking back now, I really should've kept going west to grab Point 46, <span class='ja'>道分灯篭</span>. It really wasn't that far away, and those 46 points would've been crucial.</p><p>Starting my climb of Shiroyama, I grabbed a photo of an outer gate of the Kogane Shrine <span class='ja'>黄金神社</span>, <b>Point 7</b>. Behind the shrine is a hiking path that goes directly up to Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span>. I'm not sure too many people knew about that. Way faster than taking the road. In the center of Shiroyama Park is the bronze statue of Kanamori, <b>Point 24</b>, <span class='ja'>長近銅像</span>. This is also where I parked my car. I dumped all my extra packet stuff in my car, and continued.</p><p>Before taking the path up to the Takayama Castle Ruins, I quickly ran over to the nearby Shoren-ji Temple <span class='ja'>照蓮寺</span>, <b>Point 18</b>. The path going up the mountain is pretty steep. Stair, after stair. It's not so bad if you're hiking normally, but in a race, it's rough. I reached the Takayama Castle Ruins <span class='ja'>高山城跡</span>, main building <span class='ja'>本丸跡</span>, <b>Point 23</b>, at 12:25pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="fourColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column fourColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>7 → 24 → 18 → 23 // (+72 points / 118 total)</p><p>There are hiking trails that spider-web themselves throughout Shiroyama.

I have no idea if they'll be run the same way as this one, but I'm game to try.</p><p>I just need to find one that's (1) allows solo participants, (2) not too far away, and (3) not too long. Unless I start doing more training, I think 3 hours is my limit.</p><p>Overall, I loved this event so much. This is my new favorite sport. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-snap">Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Originally released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, it immediately became a fan favorite leveraging the rise of Pokemon fandom throughout the world, and having very unique gameplay that was very easy to learn and understand, and matched the franchise so well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In Pokemon Snap, you are positioned in an automated vehicle with a camera. Your goal is to take good-looking photos of all the various Pokemon in the environment. After you complete a level, you choose one photo to represent each Pokemon species you find. Photos are scored and after various goal posts, more levels and equipment are unlocked.</p><p>Lately, I've been a bit burnt out, so I wanted to spend some time with a game. Just like everyone else, I have fond memories of Pokemon Snap, too. As I started playing the game around 9am, I didn't think I would play through the entire game, completing the Photo-dex before Noon. Man, it is really short. Some games from 20 and 30 years ago felt so big and massive back then. Taking photos freely in an environment feels like something so expansive and never ending. Not even 3 hours is pretty crazy.</p><p>This is the complete opposite of recent sequel, released in 2021. <a href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap" title="/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a> doesn't have a million levels, nor access to all 1000 pokemon, but the amount of replayability from altering course tracks, finding signature photo opportunities of each pokemon, and even secret Pokemon, pushes the game in the opposite direction where there is too much to do.</p><p>Anyways, it was a fun Saturday morning game. While 3 hours is pretty short, it doesn't over stay its welcome. Below are all of my best photos from my play through. Unfortunately, the Mister N64 core doesn't allow screenshots, so these were done through OBS.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-park">Ghibli Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 3, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nearly two years ago, Ghibli Park was first opened in the Aichi Commemorative Expo Park, northeast of Nagoya. Ghibli Park is an open-air museum of sorts, with replica houses, buildings, and environments from various works by Ghibli Film. In the center of it all, is the Ghibli Warehouse, which houses a museum, other exhibits, a theater, shops, and several other recreations of Ghibli works and history.</p><p>There are four open-air areas of the Ghibli Park, each require an advanced ticket to enter. Each area is spread around the Expo Park. Here's a map:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp"></a></p><p>In addition to the <span class="orange"><b>Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></b></span> in the middle, the <span class="light_blue"><b>Hill of Youth <span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></b></span> is near one of the main parking lots and the train station in the north. It's most likely the first area you'll come across. Near the other parking lot and to the south is <span class="olive"><b>Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'>どんどの森</span></b></span>. These were the first areas available when Ghibli Park first opened on November 1st, 2022. Since then, in November 2023, the <span class="purple"><b>Mononoke Village <span class='ja'>もののけの里</span></b></span> in the northeast was completed. And most centralized and most recently opened in March 2024 is the <span class="magenta"><b>Valley of Witches <span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></b></span>.</p><p>One of my friends visited the park a year or more ago, and said it wasn't all that special, but this is absolutely not the case. Seeing the scale of these areas in person is incredible. Climbing to the scenic lookout point, prior to the park's opening, and peering down at a life-size replica of Howl's Moving Castle brought up feelings that I didn't know I had.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" /></a></p><p>DAMN. That's it. That's fricken it! The madmen did it!</p><div class='title'><b>Tickets</b></div><p>Tickets for the Ghibli Park are all purchased in advance, online through Lawson. There are 4 different types of tickets available, with different levels of access to the park. The main tickets are purchases 2 months in advance, but there are last-minute tickets you can buy within 7 days prior to visit.</p><p>The standard ticket is the Grand Sanpo Pass, or Grand Walking Pass. This pass allows entrance to all four outdoor areas of Ghibli Park, and gives a specific entrance time to the Ghibli Warehouse. When you buy the ticket, the time you're choosing is when you can enter the Warehouse. You can enter any of the outside areas at anytime throughout the day. Tickets are 3500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>The second ticket is the Grand Sanpo Premium Pass. This also has a specific time for the Warehouse and allows entrance to all four outdoor areas. The Premium part allows entrance to specific buildings inside of the areas, including Mei & Satsuki's Home, the Earth Antique Store, Okino's Residence, the Witch's Home, and Howl's Moving Castle. Without a premium pass, you cannot enter these buildings. This ticket is 7300<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>There's a third ticket which only includes access to Mononoke Village, The Valley of Witches, and all buildings in the Valley of Witches. Because these two areas are recent additions to the Ghibli Park, they created a new ticket just for people who had visited in the first year. This ticket is 3300<span class='ja'>円</span>, and I think it will only be available temporarily for a little while longer.</p><p>The final type of ticket is the last-minute Sanpo Pass. This ticket can only be purchased 7 days before your arrival, and it only includes the 4 outdoor areas of the park. There's no access to buildings, and no access to the Ghibli Warehouse. Also, you only have 3 hours to use your tickets to enter the areas. This ticket is only 1500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>I purchased the 3500<span class='ja'>円</span> Grand Sanpo Pass for November 1st, the 2-year anniversary of the park's opening. The Premium Pass sold out too quickly for me to buy, but there seemed like a lot to do already. There were so many places to go and see. I wanted this trip to be more of a dry run rather than an exhaustive one. My warehouse entry time was Noon.</p><div class='title'><b>Open and Opening</b></div><p>Despite Ghibli Park's website clearly stating that there is absolutely no parking, there was plenty of parking. I think they state this based on a technicality that Ghibli Park itself has no dedicated parking, but the Expo Park has plenty. </p><p>While Ghibli Park is the main draw (and often only draw) for the Expo Park, Ghibli Park still treats itself part of the area, rather than the whole thing. As such, the park is almost completely open. I arrived at around 8:30am, well before the 10am opening time. I was planning on sitting in my car, and going through photos. But, so many people were walking in after they parked.</p><p>Unlike a typical theme park or museum, there is no gate, and no perimeter closing the park off to people who didn't have tickets.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The bell tower elevator was completely open. Just hop in, and go down to the park area without showing a ticket or anything. I kept looking around for where I needed to scan my ticket or what I needed to do.</p><p>Each of the specific areas of Ghibli Park are ticketed, but the entire park itself is completely open. You don't need a ticket to walk around the park! Plus, there are a lot of things you can do and see without even having a ticket.</p><p>Opening around 9am was the observation point. I walked up to the top, and it gave a full view of the Valley of Witches, the newest and largest addition to the park. Again, no ticket required.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>No one was yet around, but some of the buildings were being prepared for today's crowds.</p><p>From the observation point, I walked down through the other path which led to the Mononoke Village. I got yelled at for entering the area even though it was all open. So, I walked around the park for a while and got a good idea of the overall layout. I came back at 10am, and gained entry.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="purple">Mononoke Village <span class='ja'>もものけの里</span></span></b></div><p>The Mononoke Village is an open area designed to look like the Emishi village at the beginning of the film. There is a path that cuts through rice fields, with the village's lookout tower, destroyed when the demon Nago attacks the village. Not far away is Nago itself covered and infested with the demon worms.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Nearby is also Okkoto on the brink of being infested and corrupted. Children can climb through him, and slide down his back.</p><p>Besides the gift-shop, the main building in the Mononoke Village is an old-style hall with a grass roof. The roof has about 3 inches of dirt, wet to the touch, for the grass to grow from.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There is an outer fence surrounding the perimeter of the hall. If the fence had grass covering, too, the hall would look like it blended into the scenery, completely camouflaged from anyone moving by, possibly explaining with the Emishi were so unknown and mythical in the film. Inside, you could spend 1200<span class='ja'>円</span> to cook your own Goheimochi.</p><p>Overall, the Mononoke area was big, but there wasn't a whole lot to do.</p><div class='title'><b>Gift Shops and Button Badges</b></div><p>Every area within Ghibli Park has its own gift shop with general and exclusive merchandise. The Mononoke Village had an Ashitaka hat, like the one in the film, some plushies, and some pins and buttons. </p><p>Every area has a button badge that matches the art from the website. The buttons are only 300<span class='ja'>円</span>, so it's not too expensive to hunt down the full set by doing to each area.</p><p><i>Spoilers</i>, but I was able to collect them all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Collecting each of the buttons was a lot like a stamp rally. It was fun hunting them down, although the process certainly prays of my sense of consumerism. Many of the gift shops have lines, so while you wait to buy the buttons, you're also tempted to buy other stuff too. </p><p>Because of the exclusive merchandise, throughout all of Ghibli Park, I ended up buying things from 7 different gift shops. My main gets are pictured above: the buttons and the Ghibli Park Guide Book. I bought a bunch of other things as Christmas Presents.</p><p>Note: Even though there are photo icons or badges of the premium areas on the website, there are no button badges for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Cat Castle Playground <span class='ja'>猫の城遊具</span></b></div><p>Just outside of the Mononoke Village is a non-ticket area called the Cat Castle Playground. It has a separate entrance fee but it's free on weekdays. I just walked around and took some photos.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There were small easter-eggs throughout the rooms and areas in the playground. Almost all of the references were things related to what cats would like. It was fine, but the playground was really not designed for me. Elementary school kids were the prime demographic, but I think even the older 5th and 6th graders would probably get bored pretty quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>Walking to Dondoko Forest</b></div><p>Having only spent about 40 minutes in Mononoke Village and the Cat Castle Playground, I still had more than an hour before my Warehouse entry time. I went to the furthest area away, Dondoko Forest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's a shortcut to the Forest by cutting through another forest. By walking through the gate and greeting the stone statue, you can take the steep, casual, or middle course going up the hill, and back down the other side. Alternatively, you could also take the cat bus from the station in front of Mononoke Village to the other side of the park. I didn't realize this at the time, but I'm more of a walker, anyway.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="olive">Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'>どんどこ森</span></span></b></div><p>The Dondoko Forest is one of the more barebones areas in the park. Once you enter through the gate, you have the option of walking or taking the tram to the top of the hill. I walked. But, I also got a little lost in the forest. Signage is not so great. At the top, you're greeted by a Totoro statue, and the gift shop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Totoro statue acts like a shrine to commemorate your ascent of the hill. The gift shop sells netsuke, amulets, and charms similar to items you'd find at a shrine with various Ghibli characters. This is where I bought the area's button.</p><p>Leading down the hill are the wooden gates welcoming you to the Dondoko Forest.

I had visited the house in 2019 with my sister and niece. Now, it's part of the premium pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Satsuki Mei home is a replica house like the character's new country home in Totoro. There's the bath, well, attic, and atrium where their father wrote his book next to piles and piles of other books. Everything is created with specific attention to detail to recreate the scenes exactly as they appeared in the film.</p><p>It was pretty crowded when we visited in 2019, but now, being part of the premium pass and how exclusive those tickets are, I'm sure it's much more relaxed and open.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="orange">Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></span></b></div><p>Having finished the Dondoko area, I walked back to the center of the park and waited in line for the Warehouse. My entry time was Noon, and the time was 11:30am.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Ghibli Warehouse is one of the key areas of the park. It's like an expanded version of the <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-museum" title="/ghibli-museum">Ghibli Museum</a> near Tokyo. You get a ticket to watch an exclusive Ghibli Film. There are areas showcasing the creativity and history of Ghibli. And, much like the rest of the park, tons of areas that replicate scenes and characters from Ghibli Film's library of works.</p><p>There is so much here. I'm going to make a separate post about it. You can look at the <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse">photos</a> now, though, if you'd like.</p><p>Ultimately, I stayed in the warehouse for over 2 hours. 20 minutes of that was waiting in line at the gift shop. I got my button, plus other gifts.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="magenta">Valley of Witches <span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></span></b></div><p>It began raining, but, next, it was finally time to visit the other key area of the park, the Valley of Witches. This area focuses on the works of Ghibli Film that specifically deal with magic, namely Kiki's Delivery Service, Earwig and the Witch, and Howl's Moving Castle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Connected to the entrance, is The Flying Oven, a full service restaurant with many dishes and treats, like the ones you've seen in Ghibli Film. Maybe an oversight on my part, but I did not eat anything in the park, at all. I had a pizza in my car from visiting Costco the day before, so I already had more food than I needed. I'll do more of a food journey on my next trip.</p><p>The road leading into the main area slowly reveals more and more buildings of the town. The first building is The Witch's Home, from Earwig and the Witch. This is the home where Bella Yaga and Mandarake live, and bring Earwig after they adopt her. This home is part of the premium pass, so I could not enter.</p><p>The road continues passed a fountain and some more buildings. There's a building with a confusing layout that is inspired by a boy who dreams of flying, like the puzzles in Laputa or Kiki. I didn't really notice any strong references. </p><p>Next to this building is the valley's Clock Tower. The Clock Tower sits at the edge of ruins from a possibly city, leading to Howl's Moving Castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Howl's Moving Castle was magnificent. While it's not one of my favorites, it's still a film that I treasure and have fond memories of watching it with friends and family across different eras of my life. Seeing this one-to-one scale recreation of the mythical building was inspiring. Visiting the inside would probably bring up even more feelings. But, premium only.</p><p>While Howl's Moving Castle is the crown jewel of the park looking from the Outside, the Okino Residence is the other treasure, but more from the inside. Also, premium only.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Okino Residence is Kiki's childhood home. This is where she lived before leaving on her journey and training to become a witch in the city of Koriko. Looking at photos online, there are beautiful rooms, like her mother's potion laboratory, the witch's shop, kitchen, and bedrooms.</p><p>Going back into the main town is the Guuchoki Bakery where Kiki lived with the Osono family. Connected to the bakery, is the Hatter's Hat Shop (from Howl), which sells hats and candy, the Witch's Bookshelf on the second floor, with various books about magic, and Sophie's workshop also on the second floor. </p><p>Nearby is a Hot Dog stand selling hot dogs with buns that look like cat's paws. They also sell beer, apparently. (Man, I need to back). On the way out of the Valley Witches is the main gift store, Thirteen Witches. This is where I bought the button.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="light_blue">Hill of Youth <span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></span></b></div><p>The final area that I had yet to visit was the Hill of Youth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are two buildings here. The main one is the antique shop from Whisper of the Heart. The ground floor is filled with antiques, and the second floor is filled with mechanical clocks and materials for creating violins. The inside of the building is premium only, and the gift shop is inside, too. In order to get my final button, I had to ask one of attendants and she escorted me inside to the store to quickly buy it.</p><p>The other building of the Hill of Youth is the Cat Office from The Cat Returns, the spin-off film to Whisper of the Heart. It's a small "cat-sized" building you can only view by peering through the windows. Inside, the Baron meets with Muta.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Without a premium pass, this area is pretty empty.</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Park</b></div><p>Overall, Ghibli Park is pretty incredible. With all the terrible shit in the world, it's amazing that there's a place you can visit that brings you back to those pure feelings of creativity and wonder that Ghibli Films so often inspire. I suppose this is how people felt when visiting Disney Land, 30 or 40 years ago, before it went bad. </p><p>While the Premium Tickets are pretty expensive, exclusive, and also gate some of the best parts of the park, the other passes aren't all that expensive and relatively easy to buy. In fact, the outdoor-only pass at only 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> available 7 days before arrival is an excellent last minute purchase for your trip to Japan.</p><p>Actually, after writing up this post and looking at the things I missed (like the food and beer), I may just buy one of those 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> passes and go back there over winter vacation on a day with really good weather. It's a really easy day trip for me.</p><p>I would definitely recommend a visit, and I would also recommend this over the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. There is way more to do in Ghibli Park and tickets are easier to get.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-museum">Nintendo Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 1, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple months ago, Nintendo announced the opening of a museum in Kyoto that showcased their rich history since their opening in the late 1800s. But, in Nintendo fashion, they didn't want to just make a boring museum. The museum has three main areas: a showcase of Nintendo history, an interactive play area with unique games, and a cafe and workshop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Nintendo Museum has been open for a month now. Tickets are given by lottery, so you sign up for 3 available times and if you're selected, you can buy tickets. One of my choices was for Halloween, and I was selected. :)</p><p>Since before its opening on October 1st, they had a press day and allowed several content creators to run amok in the place. The entire museum has been cataloged with tons of photos and videos online. Watching all that stuff can prepare you for the museum. But, in my case, it put my expectations too high on what I wanted.  Overall, <b>the museum was just okay.</b></p><p>Here is some advice for the museum, if you plan on visiting. Note: The museum hours are 10am to 5pm, and my entry time was 1pm.</p><div class='title'><b>Pointers for the Store</b></div><p>Go to the store immediately when you arrive.</p><p>Those controller cushions only have a limited amount available each day. I saw people walking around having bought some, but I don't know if they had been there all day and got them at 11am or Noon or something. I don't know if you have to say some password to someone to get one. I entered the store around 2pm maybe, and I circled around quite a bit and saw nothing.</p><p>The controller cushions aren't as big as they look. The Wii one is the longest at maybe 3 feet. I was interested in the Super Famicom controller, but it was probably 2 feet wide. Pretty small.</p><p>The controller cushions are also limited to one per person among all four types. Additionally, the tiny plastic controller replicas are also limited one per person. They had some of those left when I arrived, so I decided to get one and roll the dice. (I got a VB controller lol)</p><p>A bunch of other stuff was sold out in the store. Apparently, all those tiny controller keychains sold out around 3pm. They also didn't have any of the high end Hanafuda cards. They were missing some other stuff too.</p><p>Stuff is expensive, too. Shirts are 5500<span class='ja'>円</span>. They did have some Ultra Hands, but there were 7500<span class='ja'>円</span>. Very few single items were under 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Also, unlike the Nintendo Store, you couldn't get points with your Nintendo Account.</p><p>Anyways, I bought a lanyard for my Nintendo card, the cheap hanafuda set, and one controller keychain.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pointers for Hanafuda</b></div><p>Sign up for Hanafuda immediately when you arrive. Sign-ups are right next to the store by the entrance.</p><p>You can only sign up for the workshop and hanafuda sessions within 2-3 hours of your entry time. So, if you decide later that you might want to do it, all the times available to you will be sold out.</p><p>I was still able to do the Hanafuda painting session, but I couldn't do the learning/play session. It's fine, though. Like many of the amusement games, it looked like it was best played with 2 people.</p><p>The painting and making hanafuda cards was pretty fun. I have some pointers on how I could probably make mine look better for next time, but I will refrain from mentioning them.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Pointers</b></div><p>I would say those are the two biggest things to pay attention to. The museum and amusement areas won't take you too long to go through, and they'll always be available for you. If you buy stuff first, it's not too difficult to lug around bags of stuff either.</p><p>As a smaller point: outside of the museum, there is nothing else around at all. This land must've been super cheap or the only thing available in the area because it's next to a Mazda dealership, a supermarket, and a bookstore. There's also a bicycle shop, and a couple other empty plots of land.</p><p>Also, if you're driving, there is scattered parking around the area. But driving in Kyoto is fucking terrible. Roads are narrower than most cities and there are too many cars. You could probably park at the Tsutaya? I think that's all paid parking, so why not?</p><div class='title'><b>The Museum</b></div><p>I arrived at the museum 2 hours early. Went to a Book Off down the road. Then walked around for a while. I eventually just sat in front of the museum with an hour left to kill. They let me in 15 minutes early. After going through the entrance, security screens, and baggage check, I was in.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not really knowing what to do first, I followed the signs and went to the 2nd floor museum. No photos allowed.</p><p>The 2nd floor showcased Nintendo prominent 40-year video game history with huge displays of each console generation and boxes from each of the 3 major regions of release: Japan, America, and Europe. They also had a sales ratio breakdown of each region, too. Nintendo 64 and Gamecube were huge in America making over half the overall total sales. The Nintendo DS had Japan take over half the total sales, too.</p><p>It was neat, but...  It didn't really impress me or move me. So many people around me were going, "Oh wow, do you remember this?" "Oh man, this is so cool." But me... I guess I already had these waves of Nintendo nostalgia wash over me thanks to the Analogue Pocket and Mister FPGA consoles, and the Super Nintendo Mini. Also, I already saw a bunch of these games at Book Off a few hours ago.</p><p>It's not really nostalgia when this stuff is so ever present in my mind.</p><div class='title'><b>Prototypes</b></div><p>This most interesting thing in the museum was off in the far corner. Behind a glass walled room were some haphazard displays of console prototypes. They had the original prototypes of Wii-motes, the gamecube, gameboy, Nintendo DS, Wii balance board, the Switch. This was actual lesser know or seen history.</p><p>Behind them was a Donkey Kong arcade game, a few other arcade games, and shelves and shelves of other hardware or sales merchandise sitting in boxes. This led into an area that was roped off.</p><p>Once they go through this initial batch of ticket holders, maybe they'll collect all this stuff into an actual exhibition room.</p><div class='title'><b>Interactive Arcade</b></div><p>All areas of the Nintendo Museum were open, so you can go downstairs whenever you wanted, play some games, and then return upstairs.</p><p>Your Nintendo Museum ticket doubles as a play pass for all the games on the 1st floor. To play a game, you tap your pass and register to play the game. You have 10 coins total (cannot be refilled). Each game took certain amounts of coins. It is not possible to play everything, but you can still play a lot. The games go by pretty quickly, and Several games require two players.</p><div class='title'><b>Giant Controllers</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I immediately noticed that Dr Mario was available on the giant Famicom controller, so that's where my first coins went. <b>Pointers?</b> These controllers are actually giant.

Recently, I got a Mister which expanded this reach even further.</p><p>Last year, I made a <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">page</a> that catalogued all of the notable games I had on my Analogue Pocket. And now I've revamped that curated list into an overall Digital Retro Game Library. This lists all the notable games I have available on both the Pocket and the Mister. More platforms may be added in the future, like PS2 and Gamecube.</p><p><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><b>Digital Retro Game Library</b></a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playlists</b></div><p>Originally, these games were being collected to build Genre lists of games using the now-canceled Playlist feature for the Analogue Pocket. The idea was that I could scroll through a Genre of games and choose one to play without having to pay attention to the hardware platform it was designed for. I was collecting all this information using <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-utils" title="/analogue-pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a>, a collection of Java programs that I wrote to manage games and stuff on my Pocket.</p><p>Later, after the Playlist feature was buried and gone, I decided to put all of this information into a webpage so I could at least see everything visually. This was the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">Pocket Curated Games</a> page, the first iteration of this project.</p><p>Later again and recently, I got a Mister. The Mister is the premiere FPGA gaming platform, and the Analogue Pocket is a handheld FPGA device. FPGA cores are written for specific hardware, so there are advantages to both platforms, although the Mister can generally handle more complicated systems and it's open source. Because of this, people have built several features and accessories on top of the platform. One thing implemented a couple years ago was Shortcuts. Rather than turning on a core and choosing a game, you could choose a game directly from the main menu. This is exactly like how I wanted Playlists to work on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>So, by updating the programs in Pocket Utils to look for Mister games, I could add all that information in the database. And writing a new program, I could automatically make shortcuts to all the games I have managed in my database, essentially creating all the Playlists I wanted from the beginning.</p><p>The Pocket Curated Page being revamped into the Digital Retro Game Library now shows all those games, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Launching Games</b></div><p>There's another really nice feature available on the Mister called TapTo. TapTo is a service that runs in the background on Mister and accepts game executing commands. The main idea for this feature was to bring back physicality to the Mister, which is a sole digital platform. Using a physical NFC reader you can "tap" a physical NFC card (or anything with an NFC signal) and it will automatically launch the game associated with it.</p><p>I'm not interested in having a huge collection of cards for individual games. But, I was very interested in TapTo's feature of launching RANDOM games. By sorting all of my shortcuts to games in Genre folders, I could launch a random Shooter or random Fighter.</p><p>Earlier this year, the TapTo service was upgraded to accept network requests. Any device connected to the same Wifi network could send a command to TapTo and it'll execute it. They launched a phone app that took advantage of this, but the request service is wide open. Anything can send commands.</p><p>So, combining yet another project with this, I added functionality in my chat bot, <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a>, to accept requests to launch random games from my Genres. With Pocket Utils updated to manage my Mister games, Schlock Bot can read this information too, and launch individual games.</p><p><pre>!game Shooter<br/>!game Panzer Dragoon (Saturn)</pre></p><p>These commands can be typed in my Discord and read by Schlock Bot.</p><div class='title'><b>Going Further</b></div><p>One annoying thing about typing in games to launch in Discord is that you have to type them correctly. Dr. Mario has a period in it, so if you type Dr Mario, it won't find the game. Also, I have a Gameboy Color version of Dr. Mario, too, so which one do you want? You need to be annoyingly specific.</p><p>So, using the Digital Game Library, you can click on a game, it'll write that execution command in Discord, Schlock Bot will read the command (if it's running), and then launch the game on Mister (if that's running too).</p><p>As such, the Digital Retro Game Library not only shows all my available games, but it's also a method of selecting games to play on the Mister.</p><p>There's a lot of moving parts in between clicking a game and it launching on the Mister. It would be a lot better if the webpage sent the request to Schlock Bot directly. But, this janky thing works for the time being. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Additions</b></div><p>Getting back to the Library, prior to getting a Mister, I set up a Playstation 2 with a game server to play all of those classic games. I made an <a href="/old/v7/playstation-2-game-inventory" title="/playstation-2-game-inventory">inventory</a> page that shows all of those games, but I'm thinking about adding them in this library, too. Also, I may mod a gamecube in the future to play a library of those games. I will want to have a library of those games listed somewhere, so adding them here or on the PS2 inventory page makes sense.</p><p>In addition to more games, I was thinking of putting download links to my save files for each game, too. I'm already doing this on the PS2 Game Inventory page with memory cards.</p><p>We'll see. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Callisto Protocol" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

You're carrying some medical supplies from the prison on Callisto to Europa, both moons of Jupiter. But, shit goes wrong when terrorists responsible for a biological attack on Europa board your ship, attack you, and ultimately send your vessel back into Callisto's atmosphere, and crash on the surface.</p><p>You survive the crash, but your copilot is dead. All members of the terror group are dead, except one. As the moon's guards discover the crash and find you, both of you are taken to the prison. </p><p>Things get even worse when the pathogen from the biological attack spreads in the prison mutating many of the inmates into deranged violent abominations. The prison begins the fall apart allowing you to mount an escape.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is how the story of Callisto Protocol begins. You are Jacob Lee, who's just a normal dude put into extreme circumstances. On the surface, it seems like a pretty standard action adventure game with an involved story and twists here and there. But, this game ends up living in the shadow of another, which dominates the conversation. </p><div class='title'><b>Derivative</b></div><p>As much as Callisto Protocol may want to stand on its own, it's hard to talk about it without talking about <a href="/old/v7/dead-space" title="/dead-space">Dead Space</a>. Callisto Protocol comes from one of the original creators of Dead Space, and has some members of the old team, too. Callisto tries its best to emulate what made Dead Space so great, but fails on almost every front. It takes some cues from <a href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us-part-2" title="/the-last-of-us-part-2">Last of Us</a> as well, but it feels like a rip-off.</p><div class='title'><b>Enemies and Combat</b></div><p>Oh, we be fighting zombies again.</p><p>Both Dead Space and Last of Us have zombies and while the high points of both those games go far behind their enemy designs, the enemies are still interesting. The necromorphs in Dead Space had a very dynamic design that supported the combat. The infected in Last of Us were detailed enough that you could see how the fungal infection grew and mutated their bodies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yep, that's a zombie. In Callisto, the biophages just look like dudes with skin problems. Later, you fight some others that look like Clickers from Last of Us. And then you fight deaf zombies EXACTLY like Clickers from Last of Us.</p><p>One departure from Dead Space is that Callisto isn't a shooter first, but a brawler. You bob and weave incoming attacks and counter with a melee weapon, so it makes sense the zombies are more like crazed humans. But now we're doing Arkham Batman combat, and Arkham Batman combat was not this stiff. Batman combat was designed around fighting multiple enemies at once, and you could react to them working together.</p><p>Callisto often struggles with this. Every attack has weight to it, but that weight often pushes you into a position you don't want. Other enemies then attack or you get stuck in a corner looking the wrong direction. It hard to tell where enemies are coming from if they aren't in front of you. Jacob isn't nimble enough to run around and take out enemies, so you always have to focus on them one-at-a-time, which slows down the game.</p><p>And you're already moving pretty slow. In Dead Space, Isaac's slow movement made sense because you're moving around in a 200lbs suit meant for protection from environmental and occupational hazards. You're like a tank. In Callisto, you're only wearing a cloth prison jump suit. Jacob isn't some huge muscle dude, either. He looks like he could sprint down a hall way and slip past a group of people. Later, you get an EVA suit, but it looks flexible enough to move easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment and Immersion</b></div><p>One of the key points of Dead Space was its immersive environment supported by the heavy futuristic machinery, dynamic lighting and color, and a sharp distinct and unique set of sounds that overwhelmed you. Incorporating all of the HUD and UI elements into the character and environment made you feel immersed in the world.</p><p>Last of Us had a similar approach. There were still some UI elements that assisted the player through exploration and combat, but the lack of music and use of silence matched with the vibrant lush overgrown environments which immersed me in the exploration of Seattle and listening for the subtle movements of enemies around blind corners.</p><p>Both games felt designed around the opportunity to give creative people a chance to make the most of their opportunities, and create dynamic and memorable experiences. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Callisto has some unique areas, but the first half of the game is moving through drab metal hallways and then the prison's sewer system. Lots of pipes and moving through vents. The arboretum is a nice area, but it's dark and muddy. Later, you visit an old mining area. The density of buildings and their layout is interesting, but the buildings themselves aren't very interesting. The environments are definitely detailed, but they don't really inspire creativity in me. It feels too restrictive.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest flop of Callisto is its lack of dynamic sound. There's no unique sound of heavy machinery working. There's no sharp crack of gun fire or welding tools. There's no use of silence to accent the enemies movements. And overall, the music is pretty generic and used too frequently. There are no surprises or memorable experiences through sound, which dampens the overall experience.</p><p>Thankfully, the monotony is broken up by breaking out onto the surface of Callisto. You put on an EVA and are shot out into the environment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow is pushed around by your foot steps and moving gates. While trying to find your way to the space depot, the blizzard often overwhelms your vision. At least now, Jacob's slow lumbering movements make sense. If Jacob could move faster or more dynamically, I would've loved to stay outside longer, but everything just seems to weigh down the experience that I want to move on to the next section as quick as possible.</p><p>In the end, we get another unique area, the clean living area of the administration.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The game could've used more unique areas like this. But, we're in a prison and we're climbing through sewers and mines. There aren't many opportunities to have fantastical elements while making the setting down-to-earth. Perhaps Callisto Protocol tries to bring too much reality to its setting. As a result, all of the edges feel sanded off.</p><div class='title'><b>What a Twist!</b></div><p>Through attempting to escape, you journey into the depths of Callisto to an abandoned mining colony from 75 years ago, and discover the truth of the biophage outbreak. Can you guess?</p><p>Oh, it turns out the government was behind the biophage attack on Europa, not the terrorists. And the terrorists were people caught up in the attack who blamed the government. The reason you were caught up in everything, too, was because the medical supplies you transported to Europa were hiding the viral agent that started the outbreak.</p><p>75 years ago, the first outbreak occurred in this mining colony as the scientists responsible for the biophage tested their progress. Once the outbreak was concealed, the prison was built on top of it to continue testing the biophage virus on inmates.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was aliens all along. The miners had discovered the corpse of a massive alien and studied its secrets. The government agency funding this science believed the larvae of the alien could help human ascend to the next level of evolution allowing them to expand within the universe further. The biophage virus was the result of their research, and injecting humans was meant to make them impervious to the harsh environment of space. But, whatdya know, it just turned them into monsters.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol is the development of this biophage to push humanity to the next level of evolution, and its eventually release and conversion of all humanity.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They got pretty close making an evolved human with this guy. But eventually he also turns into a mindless monster and you gotta shoot him in the face anyway. With their prime experiment defeated, the government (actually a crazed religious group) sets the prison to self-destruct. With only one escape pod available, you shove your friend into it and she escapes along with records of the event and a sample of the virus.</p><p>You are still stuck on the planet and the game ends as the monster jumps at you. No real ending, just a few words and cut to black.</p><div class='title'><b>Continued in DLC</b></div><p>In the $15 DLC, the story continues. You wake up with the doctor speaking to your through an earpiece. Get up! There are more secrets to be had! You travel to her lab and her hologram explains about the further experiments and atrocities. There was a competing experiment being held to push humans to the next stage of evolution. And you find out that the doctor led the project.</p><p>You stumble further down into her lab into far more interesting, detailed, and amazing looking areas than the main game. Areas use a lot of orange light to break away from the boring metal blue walls and floors. Bio-matter spreads and grows from the walls transforming it into an alien or infested looking environment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It is often difficult to tell whether something is going to come out of the wall to get you, or whether danger is just around the corner. The terrible "mood" music and jump scares are turned down and used in actual appropriate moments compared to the main game.</p><p>Sanity effects are now used, too, as it feels like Jacob is slowing falling apart mentally. You open up a treasure chest to receive nothing, and turn around to find the chest in front of you again, but unopened. You move down a hallway as enemies continuously attack you, not realizing the path forward is to turn around.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Enemy</b></div><p>Something new appears in the depths of the labs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The prison bots from before have been infected and fused with bio-matter making them stronger and more aggressive than before. It's still not too difficult to dodge out of the way and slam them with your electrified police baton, though.</p><p>However, as you enter the laboratory in the police bot factory, your baton is destroyed after beating a bot over and over again to its death. Your main weapon used throughout the entire game and a fundamental staple of how the game play works is removed from your arsenal. You can no longer easily dodge and counter enemies. The brawler has turned into a clumsy shooter.</p><p>It's not long before you are chased into a test room with bots closing in on all of your sides when you obtain the best funnest weapon in the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hammer replaces your police baton and smashes through bots after a few hits. Zombies from before are cut through like butter. Up until this point, the whole game felt like you're fighting against the gameplay. Eventually you find a rhythm that works, but it ends up becoming a single use solution to every encounter. Now you feel incredible and powerful by slicing and smashing through everything that sucked about the game before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Reason</b></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the Callisto Protocol is the development of the biophage to push humanity into the next stage of evolution. Their main plan ended up turning people into zombie monsters.</p><p>The doctor had a different idea and tried to compete with them. The doctor created these bio-bots as her solution to humanity's evolution. The bots were fused with human skin, muscles, and brain using the alien biophage material. Human consciousness was then uploaded into the bots for humanity to live on forever.</p><p>It didn't work. Just like the zombies, the bots became mindless machines of destruction and ripped apart anything that was human, relying too much on the prison's programming.</p><div class='title'><b>The Ending</b></div><p>The doctor had been luring you further into the depths of the lab to reach an escape pod she had prepared for herself. As you arrive near the hatch, the doctor is grabbed by a robot. The bot infects and mutates the doctor into an abomination that you juke, jive, and smash until it's dead. With the doctor's voice still in your ear, you proceed to the escape pod.</p><p>The escape pod is your ship, though. It's your destroyed ship that crashed into Callisto in the beginning. The doctor directs you to hop on the controls and get out of there. You escape the prison, escape the moon. You continue to fly as far away as fast as you can. And space begins to light up. The light gets brighter and brighter to point where you can't see anything but white.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's done. You're done. You're dead. You've been dead this whole time.</p><p>As your friend had escaped earlier with all the lab's data, you were killed as the enemies closed in. The doctor found your body, and ignited the few remaining sparks in your brain. The doctor used the implant in your head linked to your friend in order to send the remaining data she had exposing the government's horrific projects on Callisto, and her involvement in the project.</p><p>It felt like the DLC was going to give some full closure to the ending. And I suppose it did. Callisto Protocol no longer ends on a cliffhanger. But, it's not a happy ending and it completely closes the book on Jacob's story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Real Life Ending</b></div><p>Most people feel cheated by the ending, and further cheated by paying $15 to get an ending that punches them in the face.</p><p>The publisher ultimately is to blame for the abrupt ending and pay-per-view ending. Krafton cut the development time towards the end of the project and forced the release date ahead of schedule. New enemy types were scrapped from the game, and the ending had to be reworked into what we got. It's pretty obvious that some of those scrapped ideas were remolded into the DLC ending.</p><p>It's poetic and perhaps intentional that the final scene is of Jacob's horrific torn-apart corpse, a signal from the developer that there is no future for this game, and a metaphor of what the developers perhaps consider the result of their ideas and hard work after the publisher forced their hand.</p><p>It sucks even more that after the release of the DLC, the developer laid off employees as the publisher realigned the focus of the studio.</p><p>I think it's easy to say Callisto Protocol is kinda lame and not all that great, but I think the DLC shows that this game and its developer had the potential to make something better and more compelling than what we got. Not everyone gets a blank check, though. And very few publishers want to take a risk. Everything has to be a financial hit these days. There's no longer any room for mediocrity even if it has some kernels of something good.</p><p>Anyways, I'm glad I played it.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space">Dead Space</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Ishimura is a massive mining starship in orbit above the planet Aegis VII, and the distress call was the last communication with anyone on board. Among the Kellion's sparse crew is Isaac Clarke, an engineer.</p><p>As Clarke and the Kellion crew board the derelict malfunctioning ship, they are attacked by transformed mutated members of the crew, known as Necromorphs. The Kellion is destroyed, and Clarke and a few other members of the Kellion begin to explore and repair the Ishimura in order to escape and find out what happened to the crew. Isaac dons his heavy duty repair suit with iconic welding helmet, an overall staple of the Dead Space series.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Dead Space is a survival horror game with heavy inspirations from Resident Evil 4 and Event Horizon. Originally released in 2008, Dead Space become one of the genres best examples of survival horror done right, but eventually the series fizzled out as it became more action oriented, which was reason enough for Electronic Arts to shut down the developer's studio. </p><p>Thankfully, EA Motive, the developers of this 2023 remake, insisted that this new game stick closely to its 2008 original, which I consider the best in the series.</p><div class='title'><b>Immersion</b></div><p>Dead Space was unique upon release as one of its strict design ideas was using absolutely no HUD. All ammo, health, and menus are displayed within the universe of the characters, as if the character themselves are looking at and using those displays. All button prompts appear on the objects in the environment. If a menu appears, it comes from Isaac's computer Rig on his wrist, and he looks at it when you select menu items.</p><p>Although, the true crown of Dead Space's immersion is the Audio. The Ishimura is a very dense, heavy, mining vessel. All the different areas have their thick heavy machines, and these machines are all distinct and loud. Often when you enter a new area, you become completely overwhelmed by the sounds of the machinery.</p><p>One of my favorite areas in the original was Engineering. As you kickstarted the engines, the overall sound was so loud you couldn't hear any enemies or footsteps or menu movements. It was a constant blast of sound until you exited the room. This area still exists in the remake, but they moved it into a corridor instead of the overall room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Isaac is really just a repairman, and all of your weapons futuristic versions of welders, strippers, nail guns, and such. All of these guns have very powerful and electrical cracks and bursts that you may hear at a futuristic construction site. All these sounds feel like they split your ears as you rip apart the space zombies. With your heavy, 200lbs armored suit, you can also stomp them into the ground with a satisfying crunch.</p><p>Everything in the environment and everything you do comes with a heavy mechanical organic weight to it. It's criminal if you don't play this game with headphones turned up to 11.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, one of the most impactful and immersive sequences is the first time you open a door, and all of the air and sound get blasted into space from a violent hull breach. Your suit's boots are magnetized so space walking is no problem, but the first time you get thrust into space feels like going over the top of a rollercoaster. It feels like part of your own breath was sucked into space, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Haunted House</b></div><p>As you continue to explore and repair the Ishimura, you move into new areas of the ship with new monsters. Often you'll reach a place of relatively quiet, only for a monster to SCREAM at you as it burst out of the ceiling or a nearby wall. This happens pretty often. As the game's sound fully immerses you in the environment, it tends to employ startling scare tactics.</p><p>You get pretty powerful later on in the game, so when a standard zombie pops out of the wall, you can quick shoot it or bash it into the ground. Even when a bunch of zombies come at you at once, you can usually take them all at once with your arsenal. So, many of these sequences turn into a corner of a haunted house. Boo!</p><p>But, the first time you fight a Brute can make you feel powerless. A brute is a gigantic zombie about the size of a car. When it comes rushing towards me and my gunfire has absolutely no effect, my next instinct is to run! But then the heavy suit makes it feel like you're trying to run in water, and its huge stomping lumbering movements are right on your heels. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are some genuine fearful movements as you try to evade death, but ultimately, you can overcome these moments by trying again after you die. Later on, you learn about the best ways of killing things by fighting the zombies over and over again.</p><div class='title'><b>Retro</b></div><p>People generally define retro games as anything made over 10 years ago. This was an easy statement to make in the PS3/360 era of gaming, as each new console had some genuine easy-to-see graphical and design improvements over the previous generation. For example, Super Mario World and Super Mario Sunshine were 11 years apart, and the difference between those games of the same series is absolutely massive. The jump from 2D to 3D was huge, but so is the idea of having to explore the world to find levels, having a more involved story with characters having motivations, and talking with characters to find more things.</p><p>The time difference between the original Dead Space and this remake is 15 years, and the overall game hasn't really changed at all. The graphics have been modernized, and load times reduced because of current generation hardware. A few quality of life features added for smoother gameplay. Isaac talks now and involves himself in the story, too. But it's still the exact same game that I remember from the Playstation 3.</p><p>Are games from the PS3/360 era really retro if their game design still fits within the modern era of game design?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe some people consider games retro if they center on a single player experience. Most modern games today have some kind of social element, so you can share the experience with friends. Or they include some kind of open world experience, so it can feel like the game is endless and you can play for hours and hours.</p><p>Dead Space is a pretty tight 12 hour game, and adding any of those modern engagement traps would ruin the experience. But, at the same time, once you finish the game (and finish it a second time), you're pretty much done with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>After the original Dead Space, the studio became known as Visceral Games and made Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3, as well as Dead Space Extraction (a light gun game), and some novels and comics. Dead Space 2 was another high for the series, but I think there was never enough lore and story to carry it to a full never-ending franchise. Dead Space 2 started the series into something more action-oriented to appeal to a general audience, and Dead Space 3 killed the franchise and the developer.</p><p>The creator of Dead Space had actually left Visceral before Dead Space 2, and recently he helmed the creation of a new game, <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> released in 2022, which seems like an actual new Dead Space game in all but name. It's either ironic or malicious that EA came along with the Dead Space remake at the same time the original creator made a new one himself. However much of Visceral's former staff work at Motive and were key developers bringing this remake to life.</p><p>The Dead Space remake does an absolutely excellent job of sticking to the original but adding a few new things and changing others to make it even better. This remake doesn't really feel like a cash-grab. It feels like the people working on it genuinely cared about Dead Space and wanted to bring it back.</p><p>Unfortunately, it really sucks that the remake did not meet the sales EA was hoping for.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Through killing space zombies and finding some survivors, Isaac uncovers the truth of what happened on the Ishimura. Members of the crew became obsessed and possessed by the religion of Unitology, which revolves around an artifact found of Aegis VII, known as The Marker. The Marker slowly morphed the colonists of Aegis VII into the Necromorphs, which attacked and infected the crew of the Ishimura.</p><p>On the surface of Aegis VII is the Hive Mind, which controls all Necromorphs. In order to pacify and destroy it, Isaac brings the Marker back to the surface of Aegis VII. There are several other twists and turns along the way as Isaac is betrayed by his crew, and caught between the motives of Earth and the Church of Unitology. </p><p>In the end, it turns out that his love interest that he's been chasing the whole game killed herself prior to the Kellion arriving at the Ishimura. He's essentially been chasing a ghost through manipulation of the Marker and an Ishimura survivor. With nothing left, Isaac continues to kill the Hive Mind, and escape the surface as the gravity tethers holding the Ishimura are severed, which sends the ship and its moon-sized payload into the planet, eradicating all remaining life.</p><p>Finally Isaac gets to rest after a job well done.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Oh, except the Marker left its mark on Isaac. In the final moments of the game, the phantom of his girlfriend attacks him. Dead Space 2 picks up with Isaac awakening in an asylum above Saturn's moon of Titan, the doctors having extracted the remnants of the Marker from his brain.</p><div class='title'><b>New Ending</b></div><p>Now there's a new, alternate ending. As Isaac runs through the Ishimura a second time, small Markers are scattered throughout the ship. Collecting all of these Markers and placing them on their alters in the Captain's quarters will unlock this ending. Now, after Isaac pacifying the Hive Mind and letting the megaton payload destroy the surface, he is no longer so solemn.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With a course set back to Earth, he mentions to the phantom of his girlfriend that he needs to build something first before they can return. Isaac has been fully corrupted and possessed by the Marker, it seems.</p><p>Motive had plans to make a Dead Space 2, but as an alternate sequel rather than a remake of the original sequel. This sequel probably could've followed this new ending, and maybe implement some of the original ideas the creators had for Dead Space 2 back in the day, rather than some mandates EA imposed on Visceral.</p><p>EA seemed keen on continuing the remake series, but plans were scrapped as sales were poor. Motive is off working on other projects.</p><p>Dead Space is dead yet again.</p><div class='title'><b>Hope</b></div><p>I'm going to check out <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> next and see if there's any life.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/emperor-and-the-imperial-palace">Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 15, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After the United States dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, they surrendered to the United States. This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.</p><p>In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.</p><p>As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack? Did he give the command to invade?</p><p>This is the overall plot of the 2012 film, Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as Bonner Fellers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp"/></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>General Bonner Fellers</b></div><p>The film focuses on Bonner Fellers. MacArthur entrusts Fellers with this mission of determining the Emperor's guilt because of Fellers close relation and expertise of Japan. After arriving in Tokyo, various members of the Japanese military are arrested, and Fellers oversees the operation understanding how these officers value sacrifice in the wake of defeat.</p><p>The arrested officers are interrogated and seemingly uncooperative. Fellers understands the ambiguity of their answers, but is still frustrated with the lack of substantial proof and direct answers required for making a clear decision to MacArthur.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp"></a></p><p>One of my initial favorite things about Emperor was Feller's frustration. Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. </p><p>This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time. This feeling of working towards the same goal as others, but being pushed aside because I'm a perceived outsider, thus being perceived as an opponent or someone that wouldn't understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Honne and Tatemae <span class='ja'>本音と建前</span></b></div><p>After watching the film recently with my Japanese language students, I had forgotten that it spent some time explaining Japanese culture. One of the key points of the film was a flashback between Fellers and his fictional girlfriend's uncle, General Kajima. The uncle explains <b>Honne</b> and <b>Tatemae</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp"></a></p><p><b>Tatemae</b> is the way that things appear. The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. <b>Honne</b> is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.</p><p>This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.</p><p>That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.</p><p>Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"</p><div class='title'><b>Group Harmony formed from Ancient History</b></div><p>I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. </p><p>Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.</p><p>As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.</p><p>Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. </p><p>In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.</p><div class='title'><b>Direct and Indirect Language</b></div><p>You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.</p><p>In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.</code></p><p>We always want to know <code>who</code> is doing <code>what</code> when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.</p><p>Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は</span> <span class='ja'>毎日</span> <span class='ja'>学校に</span> <span class='ja'>歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.</p><p>Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "<span class='ja'>すみません、ちょっと。。</span>" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.</p><p>The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.</p><p>Anyways... back to Emperor.</p><div class='title'><b>Dai-Ichi Life Building <span class='ja'>第一生命</span></b></div><p>As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds.

Do people really want another boring historical drama based on facts? If Fellers has "love" for Japan, we gotta show that love somehow. Love for a woman is the easiest way to do this.

It also does well introducing people to some parts of Japanese culture they probably aren't familiar with. So many war movies focus on heroes in battle and show the horror of war.

Around 9:30am, they allowed tour members to enter the Kikyo-mon Gate and wait at the visitor center for orientation. They explained the route of the tour, and had pamphlets available. Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it. I bought a small guidebook.</p><p>Here are scan of pamphlets and that guidebook:</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Shortened Tour</b></div><p>Given the summer heat, tours were only offered in the morning, and the tour today was cut short. The normal tour of 75 minutes was cut down to 45 minutes. </p><p>The overall tour starts from the visitor center, travels down the road passed the Fujimi-yagura <span class='ja'>富士見櫓</span>, passed the Imperial Household building, the main Imperial Palace, and over the Nijuu-bashi bridge <span class='ja'>二重橋</span>. From the bridge, the tour goes back to the Imperial Palace, behind the Imperial Household building, along the Lotus moat, and back to the Visitor center. Our cut tour just skipped the walk behind the Household building.</p><div class='title'><b>Niju-bashi Bridge <span class='ja'>二重橋</span></b></div><p>Being able to walk over the Niju-bashi and viewing the Sei-mon Gate and Bridge from the reverse was neat.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Ultimately, a really great photo would be from someone standing outside of the Imperial Palace with their camera focused on the Niju-bashi Bridge. Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.</p><p>It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Tour</b></div><p>Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.</p><p>The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.</p><p>I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ema Market at Yamazakura 山桜神社" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ema-market-at-yamazakura">Ema Market at Yamazakura 山桜神社</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 8, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> are horse paintings created at the height of summer in Takayama. People have these paintings created to bring luck and protection to a person's family or business through the upcoming year. This tradition began several hundred years ago, when farmers would bring their horses to the <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kannon Temple</a> <span class='ja'>松倉観音</span> on nearby Matsukura mountain to pray to Kannon for their protection. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /></p><p>The Matsukura Kannon Temple was first established in the 1690s by a Buddhist Monk named Tenden Koutou <span class='ja'>天電高幢</span>. Kannon is a Buddhist with six transformations, and the Matsukura Temple specifically worships Bato Kannon  <span class='ja'>馬頭観音</span>, the horse-headed transformation of Kannon. </p><p>Traditionally, the Hida region has been populated by farmers, so horses were a very important part of their lives. They were used in their farm work for cultivating their fields and transporting food to town. They were also needed to travel the long distance up north or down south. People considered them part of their family. As such, their stables were connected to their houses at the front door.</p><p>Each year on July 9th, people would bring their horses to the Matsukura Temple to have their horse blessed by the monks of Bato Kannon. 400 years ago, traveling up the Matsukura mountain to reach the temple was difficult, and horses were often injured. As the custom grew in popularity, it became even more troublesome to bring horses up the mountain.</p><p>Because of this, Emas <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> were created. Rather than bringing your physical horse up the mountain, you could buy a painting of your horse, have the monks bless the painting, and receive the same protection and fortune. People would hang the painting near their front door, near their horse's stable. Over time, these paintings have come to represent general good luck. As the horse faces inwards, it would bring you good luck to your home or business.</p><p>In <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">previous years</a>, I've gone up the Matsukura mountain to visit the Kannon Temple and get a horse painting. But, that's not the only place that makes these paintings.</p><div class='title'><b>Yamazakura Shrine <span class='ja'>山桜神社</span></b></div><p>Yamazakura Shrine is a small shrine on Honmachi street, one of the main streets in Takayama. It is squished between two restaurants. Despite being centrally located, it's perhaps more annoying to reach than the Kannon Temple on the mountain because there's no parking (for free) around the area. Although old people just park in the middle of the street anyway.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yamazakura Shrine is named after a local horse that became a legend. Yamazakura <span class='ja'>山桜</span> was born in the town of Nyukawa (NE town of Takayama) and became the horse of Kanamori Yorinao <span class='ja'>金森頼直</span>, the reigning ruler of Takayama at the time, great grandson of Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, who established modern Takayama. Yorinao was in Edo when the Great Fire of Edo happened in 1657. Yorinao was completely engulfed in flames in his guest house. The story goes that Yamazakura burst through the door allowing Yorinao to get on his back. The horse rushed out of the building and leaped into the river extinguishing the flames saving his life.</p><p>Yorinao was so grateful to his horse. He established the horse's stable in downtown Takayama on Honmachi street so the people of Takayama would look after him and treat him with respect. After Yamazakura's death, he was cremated and ashes spread at the foot of Mt. Matsukura on the path to the Kannon Temple. At the location of the stable, Yamazakura Shrine <span class='ja'>山桜神社</span> was established. Besides praying to Bato Kannon for protection and prosperity, the shrine specializes in protection from fire.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema Market <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Every year, the Yamazakura Shrine advertises in the town newsletter and I often see these advertisements around the shrine when I drive by. Rather than go to Matsukura Kannon, I wanted to visit a different Ema distributer this year.</p><p><p class="img"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link"><img style="height: 724px; width: 512; text-align: center;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" /></a></p></p><p>Yamazakura and Bato Kannon are celebrated on August 8th, 9th, and 10th each year at the Yamazakura shrine, but the shrine is open from August 1st to 10th at 10am to 3pm each day. I had time to visit on August 7th before class in the evening. You're able to make an order <a href="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html" title="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html">online</a> prior to visiting. But, if you just show up, they don't have a standard order form, like the Kannon temple. You just tell them your name, the Ema size, what color (black/white), and which way it should face (left/right). The small painting was 1800yen.</p><p>Because the shrine is so small, they only let a few people in at a time.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There are a few different designs beyond just the color of the horse, I think for different luck.

| July 17, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Late last year, English gaming company 8bitmods released a device called the <b>MemCard Pro 2</b>. It is advertised as "the last memory card you'll ever need." It works for both Playstation 1 and Playstation 2, and it stores all of its data for memory on an SD card. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After putting together my <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2 set up</a>, I wanted some way of being able to backup all of my save data from my decade of playing the Playstation 1 and 2. Having a memory card that uses an SD card was what I wanted, and I found this.</p><p>But, it does MUCH more than just store save files on an SD card. It has a paging system, so you can easily create a new card with the press of a button. It identifies games with Game Id, so it can create unique memory cards for each game. And the card has Wifi, so all of its functions can be controlled by a web interface!</p><div class='title'><b>Updating</b></div><p>Before doing anything, you need an SD card. Each PS2 memory card is 8mb so even having an SD card with 128gb of space is massive over kill. I bought a 64gb Samsung card for around $10 since it seemed to be the cheapest option. 32gb cards were available, but they were around the same price. May as well get a slightly large one. The SD card must be formatted either FAT32 or ExFat. I went with ExFat.</p><p>With the card ready to go, the next necessary step is firmware. You should update to the most recent version for access to all of the current features. Here's the link to the firmware:<br/><a href="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public" title="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public">Latest Firmware Download</a></p><p>Put the SD card in the MemCard and put the MemCard in the PS2. Power it on, and it'll start updating. When finished, it is ready to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Wi-Fi</b></div><p>You may think that Wi-Fi is unnecessary for a memory card, but you have so many more methods of control than being limited to the 2-button, small screen interface attached to the PS2. When you want to change card, you can easily do it with a scroll and a click in a web browser.</p><p>Setting up the Wi-Fi has a few steps that are pretty easy. First, you need to hold down the Left button and release to enter the Menu. Click down to Wi-Fi and select it. You'll be given an IP address. Now, the memcard pro is broadcasting as an access point. It wants you to connect to the access point and visit the webpage at that IP address.

You can further set up which memory card should be selected by default when the console powers up. And, you can set up cloud backup with Google Drive. You can also update the firmware from here, too, rather than doing it manually.</p><div class='title'><b>Save Management</b></div><p>One of the best features of the Memcard is identifying games using Game_Id. Every disc printed and created for a Playstation 1 and 2 has a unique Game_Id associated with it and the Memcard can identify this ID and automatically create or switch to a virtual memory card used only for that game. It does this by default, but you can change this behavior in the settings.</p><p>That means that you don't need to worry about trying to find which cards have which saves. You also don't have to worry about space on a card because other games won't be there to fill the space. And, even if you do save a lot in one game and use up all of the space, you can create a new page and have up to 8 memory cards for each game.</p><p>All memory cards are stored as virtual drives in the <code>mcd</code> format on the SD card. Unfortunately, you can't modify the contents of the card directly on a PC. So, if you want to add stuff on the card directly, you still need to use uLaunchELF on the PS2.</p><p>There might be something out there that will mount of the drive and give you access because people have written scripts and programs that access the contents of the cards for Save Splitting. But, I haven't found anything yet. Save Splitting is useful when moving the contents of your current memory card stash into the Memcard.</p><div class='title'><b>Transferring Old Memory Cards</b></div><p>I have an old plastic bag full of memory cards from the late 90s and 2000s.

From there, we have to use Save Splitting programs to separate and sort all of the saves into their own memory cards.</p><p>Overall, this is a 2-step process for both Playstation 1 and 2, and the first step is identical for both: we need to manually transfer all Memory Card saves from one memory card to another.

Pretty self-explanatory. Put all your saves in the import folder, run the script, and all of the split saves will be in the export folder. </p><p>The script is run from a PowerShell instance and you need to Run it as an Administrator, since it'll be moving and editing files. Once opened, navigate to the script's location, and execute the script by typing:</p><p><pre>.\split.ps1</pre></p><p>The script may not run at first because Windows doesn't want you to run scripts that change the contents of your computer without you understanding what you're actually doing.

It is the perfect way of preserving all of your saves from the past and managing them today, as long as you're running them on original hardware. That's really the one downside. If you're emulating games on PC or some other device, the Memcard Pro2 is good for extracting the saves, but you won't need it beyond that.
