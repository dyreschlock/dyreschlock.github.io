I bought the premium Sanpo-pass, so I was able to visit all of the outdoor areas as well as enter the Ghibli Warehouse. The Ghibli Warehouse is very similar to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, but it is much larger and has more areas to explore. You can also take photos throughout the building. :)</p><p>This year, I went back to Ghibli Park twice in September and October. In September, Zach, Dirk, and I had tickets for a Gyoza festival happening in the same park. This was also the hottest day I had ever experienced in Japan. My dash read 43 or 45 degrees. We walked around to a few areas of Ghibli Park, but didn't have tickets. The second time was in October with Jason, and I had purchased the Mononoke/Witches pass.</p><p>In the time since writing <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-park" title="/ghibli-park">my article last year</a>, purchasing tickets for Ghibli park have become much more convoluted. At the time of purchasing my October tickets, there were 7 or 8 different tiers of tickets. Each of the outside areas was split into their own ticket and each had an up-sell of entering the Ghibli Warehouse. Even though it was weeks after they were available, I could get a ticket that gave entry for the Mononoke Village, Valley of the Witches, and Ghibli Warehouse.</p><p><i>Update Dec 2025</i>: Tickets for Ghibli Park have changed again to become simple like they were before. Now there are only two tiers of tickets available. One ticket that offers entry to all areas of the park. And a second ticket identical to the one I bought for October. It seems like the only way you can enter Hill of Youth and Dondoko Hill is by buying the 7500<span class='ja'>円</span> ticket.</p><p>Even though, we only had tickets for entry in the Valley of the Witches, <b>standby tickets</b> were still available to entry buildings. The premium tickets guarantee entry to these buildings. In the Valley of the Witches, there are 3 buildings: Howl's Moving Castle, the Okino Residence, and The House of the Witches. Howl's Castle sold quickly, but we could visit the two other homes. :) (No photos, though.)</p><p>Our Entry for the Ghibli Warehouse was at 3pm, so after visiting our outside areas, we went inside, watched our movie, and walked around. Our film this time was <a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out" title="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out">Koro's Big Day Out</a>. At this point, I think I've seen half of the exclusive Museum/Warehouse films.</p><p>I wasn't planning on taking photos, but (1) there was a new area opened in the Warehouse compared to last time, (2) at the end of the day, big lines for photo opportunities were really short, and (3) also it was generally not so crowded allowing for more photos elsewhere. So, below, you can take a look of the photos, and compare them with <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse">my Warehouse photos from last year.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Showa Hall Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/showa-hall-additions">Showa Hall Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is a retro museum that showcases many common things from Japanese homes and businesses of the Showa Era (roughly 1927 to 1989). Although, in recent years, many items of the early Heisei period (from 1989) have begun sneaking their way in.</p><p>I've visited Showa Hall many times. I took a bunch of photos <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall" title="/showa-hall">back in 2014</a> and recently went <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall-2" title="/showa-hall-2">back to 2023</a> to take a lot more photos. Tourism in Takayama has exploded since my first years living here, so many changes have also happened in Showa Hall. You can see those changes <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall-2" title="/showa-hall-2">in the 2023 post</a>.</p><p>But, even since 2023, there have been more changes, specifically upstairs. In 2023, they had a small video game annex running Super Famicom Minis with cartridges and posters on the wall. They have since removed all of their old music memorablia near there and created a replica of a children's room with several toys and video games connected to old TVs. This is much more of a Heisei room than a Showa room.</p><p>I took several photos of the new area, and some of other areas, too. You can see them below.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hida no Sato Fall Illumination" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hida-no-sato-fall-illumination">Hida no Sato Fall Illumination</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All of these homes were transported from their original locations around Hida Takayama into this village located at the base of the Matsukura mountain. Throughout the year, you can view the old classic homes with some beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons.</p><p>From October 11th to November 9th this year and only on the weekends, you can enter the museum at night and view the homes and the scenery lit up. Only the areas near the central pond were illuminated, so you couldn't view everything in the village. All of the areas away from the center were pitch black and roped off.</p><p>A friend from college, Jason, visited Takayama, and we showed up right as entry for the night illumination began.

| October 19, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After getting a Mister FPGA last year, I wanted to get ALL the accessories and try out everything the system had to offer (within reason). One of the accessories I bought into was TapTo. </p><div class='title'><b>TapTo (or Zaparoo)</b></div><p>TapTo (now renamed Zaparoo due to fear (or reality) of trademark infridgement) is a service that constantly runs in the background on Mister. With a connected NFC reader, any NFC signal it reads will automatically run instructions. The main use of this is having a physical set of cards or objects representing your favorite games. Tap the object and the game runs automatically without having to go through menus. </p><p>It's a fun way of bringing physicality back to a digital platform, and people have let their creativity fly. There's a replica miniature C64 disk drive with an NFC reader inside, and you insert cards like floppies. Some folks have put NFC stickers on their physical game cartridges and use those to boot up games. People print their own NFC cards with various styles and images. People have also made figures with NFC buttons inside. The sky is the limit.</p><p>For me, I thought this was all unnecessary. You're removing one of the advantages of having a digital platform which is reducing your amount of clutter. But, you can have TapTo (Zaparoo) do more than just execute games. You can have it execute button macros. And you can have it execute random games.</p><p>I was most interested in the random games. The standard randomization is to have it choose a console and execute a random games on that console. But, unlike the Analogue Pocket, you can build lists of favorites on the Mister using MGL files. So building lists of my favorite games in each genre, I can Tap a card, and have it run a random Shooter or Puzzle game or Fighting game. These are all single serving games, so it makes sense to randomly try one for 5 or 10 minutes and find a new one.</p><p>But, rather than use printed cards, Nintendo Amiibos use NFC, too. I could register the Pacman Amiibo to boot up a random arcade game, and use Ryu to boot up a Fighter. Dr. Mario for Puzzle games. And for Shooters? A Vic Viper would've been amazing. The closest is Star Fox, but those figures look terrible. I just went with Mega Man.</p><div class='title'><b>NFC Reader</b></div><p>You can use any NFC reader with Mister, but all the official images used a particular one. It was only 764<span class='ja'>円</span> on Aliexpress! So cheap! Why not buy it?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was so small! I was thinking that it would be the size of a trading card, but it's less than half that size. This is great because it has allowed creative folks to sneak it into their enclosures and even in their Mister cases. My Mister case is shoved into the shelf, though, so it's not practical for me to do that.</p><p>I wanted to create a platform that could stick out of shelf for easy placement of Amiibo figures. Because the reader is like a tiny trading card, I thought I could use one of those hard plastic trading card protectors. Just screw the thing in there, and it would make for a pretty piece.</p><div class='title'><b>Hard Plastic Card Protector</b></div><p>Amazon had a few different sizes of these sandwich plate style plastic card protectors available, so I bought a standard trading card size and a smaller size closer to the dimensions of the NFC reader. This one:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1">Amazon Link</a>. Now, a year later, it's out of stock, but I bought it for only 660<span class='ja'>円</span>. Maybe that's expensive for a single card protector, but I think it's a good price for an NFC enclosure.</p><p>Although, with buying this protector, I wasn't really thinking about how the reader was going to slip between the two plastic plates. A card is as thin as paper. The PCB of the reader is thicker than that, plus it has a USB-C connector on it. The protector came with a thin plastic frame border for the card to hold it in place, but that would not work with the reader.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, the protector was a good size, but I did not think about the USB-C connector. I wanted the PCB more centered, but the USB-C plug on the cable is WAY thicker than the connector. The USB-C connector would have to be flush with the outer rim of the plastic for it to connect.</p><p>The included screws weren't longer enough for added height, so I had to buy some new ones. My local hardware store was able to identify the guage of the screws at M4. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/IMG_2660.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/IMG_2660.webp">They sold these packs of screws, nuts, and washers.</a> I had a few different lengths from some other projects, but I bought one of those packs with 15mm length screws.</p><p>So, I ultimately used the following:</p><p>4 Screws - M4 Size - 15mm Length<br/>4 Nuts - M4 Size<br/>8 Washers - M4 Size<br/>4 Thumb Nuts - Reusing the ones including with the protector.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was a little tight, but it had to be to hold the USB-C connector in place. If it was too loose, the plates wouldn't hold it and you couldn't plug it in without pushing the PCB in further. Although, too tight and it could've cracked the plates or warped the connector. Adding the washers and screws gave it just enough height to hold it in place well enough. Although, it still slipped around and it could be pulled out easily.</p><p>The perfect solution would be to design a 3D printed bracket that could be flush with all edges of the plates and hold the NFC reader in place.</p><div class='title'><b>3D Printed Bracket</b></div><p>So, after almost a year after putting the plates together, I finally designed a bracket. I didn't realize that my sister had a small 3D printer, so it was the perfect excuse to finally make this thing. Her model of printer was a ToyBox, a more accessible consumer level printer which allowed her kids to make little figurines and such. It also accepted custom STL files, so you could still print whatever.</p><p>Looking online, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" title="https://www.tinkercad.com/">TinkerCad</a> was recommended as an easy online program for creating STL files. And it was really easy to figure out how to move around the view, create objects, and also create negative objects which cut into the solid shapes ultimately creating and shaping your vision.</p><p>Being very precise and measuring all lengths using a tape measure, I put together the model. The plates measured 74mm by 74mm, and I added 5mm height. The NFC reader measured 40mm by 61mm, so I added some grooves for the reader to rest into the model and stay in place. I added rounded corners and measured the screw holes. I also added some divots for the washers.</p><p>It did not take long to create the model. I cut out more of the solid areas to use less material when printing. Also, I flipped the model upside down thinking that it would be better to have the flat areas printed first.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" /></p><p>Here's the file: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing">Google Docs / TapTo Bracket Thin Upside-Down.stl</a></p><p>My sister had several failed attempts trying to print it for some reason. I've never owned a 3D printer, but it seems like there's so much variance in print quality depending on properly seeding the model to the bench, using quality materials, making sure the printer head is clean to allow clean material on the bench, the speed of building the model, and generally just the overall quality and precision of the printer itself. Seems like a nightmare.</p><p>My friend Jason was coming to visit, so I asked if he knew anyone with a decent printer setup. And he was able to get an clean print of my file.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was an exact clean print!

The recent ADGQ run of Crazy Taxi resparked some dormant brain cells and reminded me of all the arcade fun the console had to offer. Ultimately, back in the day, I would shelf the console in favor of the Playstation 2 and its library of much deeper story telling games. But, the console would occasionally get pulled out of storage when friends were around.</p><p>With this wave of nostalgia, I purchased several hardware mods to build an ultimate Dreamcast with all my favorite games available to play at a touch. I received all the packages, but my Dreamcast was half a world away in the United States. This summer, I returned home, and now I have all of my original Dreamcast hardware on hand, and finally took the weekend to put everything together.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Spoilers. It is excellent, and I am amazed how easy it was to install everything and how seemless everything worked on the first try.</p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast Hardware</b></div><p>Here is all of my original hardware from back in the day.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were a few surprises. </p><p>First, I had completely forgotten that I bought a VGA box. After really crawling into my memory about when this happened, I do recall hooking it up to my LCD monitor a few times. But I never used it that way for long periods of time because it was a nuisance to my computer set up.</p><p>Second, I had also forgotten about some other prior modding. 2007 was probably the last time I had used my Dreamcast. At that time, I had purchased some new Shmup releases and the discs would scrap along the shell inside of the disc tray. <a href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast" title="/end-gen-dreamcast">I made a few modifications</a>, and eventually <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.webp">taped the lid sensor</a> to always be closed.</p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast Mods</b></div><p>For modding and upgrading the Dreamcast, I purchased the following:</p><p>- <b>GDEmu Disc Emulator</b> (8019<span class='ja'>円</span> / $53.46)<br/>- <b>Noctua Fan Replacement</b> (4924<span class='ja'>円</span> / $32.82)<br/>- <b>DreamPSU Power Supply Replacement</b> (3304<span class='ja'>円</span> / $22.03)<br/>- <b>Console Shell Replacement</b> (in Smoke Black) (4994<span class='ja'>円</span> / $33.29)<br/>- <b>Bitfunk Dreamcast HDMI Adapter</b> (2519<span class='ja'>円</span> / $16.79)<br/>- <b>Retro Fighters D6 Controller</b> (released in Feburary 2025) ($65.89)<br/>- <b>8BitMods VMU Pro</b> (in Smoke Black) (released in November 2025) ($94.44)<br/>- <b>128gb SD Card</b> (2865<span class='ja'>円</span> / $18.77)</p><p>The top 5 hardware mods were purchased from AliExpress from various retailers. I bought the D6 Controller from Retro Fighters directly. The VMU Pro isn't out yet, but it's only available through the 8BitMods site. Those prices include shipping to Japan. Maybe it's a bit expensive, but I think it's a small price to have a dedicated machine that can easily play all of these great games.</p><p>I should note that understanding which mods to buy and what was required came from another one of Tito's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA">Macho Nacho YouTube videos</a>, similar to <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">my PS2 build</a>. He put all of this stuff together a couple of years ago.</p><p>Ultimately, I decided to skip using the DreamPSU and the HDMI Adapter. Since its release, the DreamPSU has had <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html" title="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html">some criticism</a>. It seems like the DreamPSU doesn't really offer anything new to the Dreamcast, and could potential cause harm. If there's nothing wrong with your current Dreamcast power supply, then there's no reason to get rid of it. </p><p>I skipped the HDMI adapter because I am able to get crisp video through the VGA box. I can pass the VGA and audio signal into my OSSC, and use that to display on my TV through HDMI. Also, the HDMI adapter works with the VGA signal, so the few games that don't work with VGA won't work with it anyway.</p><p>My Saturday afternoon was spent replacing the Dreamcast shell and installing the GDemu and the fan.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's important to note that the GDemu only works on <b><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.webp">version VA1</a></b> consoles, denoted by the circled 1 on the bottom sticker. Revision VA1 consoles are the most common, so you most likely own that one. VA0 consoles were only produced through mid-1999, so perhaps only launch models in the US were VA0. The VA1 started production in mid-1999 and continued through late 2000. VA2 revision models began production around October and December 2000, but so they may have come to market in early 2001, a few months before Sega announced the Dreamcast was done.</p><div class='title'><b>Disassembly</b></div><p>The Dreamcast can be completely taken apart using a Phillips head screwdriver. </p><p>The disassembly starts with the 4 screws keeping the outer shell in place. You'll need to remove the modem to get at the 4th corner screw. With the shell removed, nearly all the inner components are visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The GD reader is the large piece in the middle. We'll replace that with the GDemu unit later. The left component is the power supply. The on/off switch in the front left is plugged into it. The controller port assembly is the component in the front. It has a battery that manages the internal clock. It also gives power to the fan on the right. Everything sits on top of a metal shield. The Dreamcast motherboard is between this shield and another one on the very bottom.</p><p>The first component to remove is the GD reader. Mine was attached using 2 screws, even though there were holes for 3 screws. Maybe I lost one while I was messing around in 2007.  Be sure to pull it out as an entire unit with the metal plate on the bottom. You don't need to disassemble the reader itself.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Next is the power supply. The power supply is held in place by 2 screws and its connection to the motherboard. First, unplug the on/off switch connected in the back and then remove the screws. The motherboard connection is really strong, so it can be difficult to pull it off with finesse. I rocked mine back and forth a bit, but be careful not too do this too much as it could dislodge the connector from the motherboard.</p><p>The power supply has a plastic shield that sits between it and the surrounding components, so don't lose that.</p><p>The next component to remove is the controller assembly in the front. You'll need to remove the power cable going to the fan and unplug the ribbon cable going to the motherboard. Both cables are removed pretty easily. Just gently rock them back and forth with a little bit of force and they'll come out. The component is held in place with 4 screws next to the controller ports.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At this point, there are only 3 more components to remove. The fan and the power button are only held in place with 2 screws each. Those are easy to remove. The direction they're installed is important, but it's easy to tell which was they go. We'll replace the fan later, so we don't need to worry about that one.</p><p>The final component is the motherboard, sandwiched between two metal shields, screwed to the bottom of the shell with 8 screws. After removing the screws, the upper metal shield is still attached to the motherboard with a few plastic pins. Removing them is unnecessary, so leave them alone. You can remove the upper shield and motherboard together as a single piece. The video plugs are set into the shell, so it takes a bit of movement to find the right angle, but eventually you can pull the motherboard out.</p><p>All that remains is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.webp">the bottom shield</a> with two termal pads. Nothing is holding this in place, so it's easy to pull out.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Gutted.</p><div class='title'><b>Reassembly</b></div><p>As I removed each component, I laid the screws next to them so I could remember which screws were used in which positions. Only a few components will be replaced, but these components rely on reusing the original screws.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the new shell, first I placed the bottom thermal shield. Then, I screwed in the power button. It's important to note that the front plastic controller port panel must be set in place before putting the motherboard in. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, make sure the termal pads are in the correct position on the bottom plate before putting the motherboard in.</p><p>One small problem with my reassembly was a single screw <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.webp">being misaligned</a>. All other points of the motherboard were perfect except for this small spot. I'm not sure why this happened, but I decided to proceed rather than remove everything and solve the problem. The screws only held the board in place and it was very secure without this screw.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After the motherboard was secure, I put the power supply back into place, and made sure to put the plastic shield in the correct position. Make sure the power button cable moves underneath the component like it did before. Push the board into its connector, screw it in with the 2 screws, and connect the power button. The power plug in the back should be flush with the shell.</p><p>In the front, angle the controller port into the shell, then use the 4 screws to attach it to the build. Then plug in the ribbon cable.</p><p>So far, everything should be pretty smooth, and we have only the fan and the GDemu left.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast GDemu Disc Emulator</b></div><p>The GDemu is a PCB with an SD card slot and a button. It plugs into the motherboard in the exact position as the GD reader and acts as an emulator. Here's the GDemu board.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just as the GD reader reads the discs and gives data to the motherboard, the GDemu also sends game data. You fill up the SD card with a bunch of games, and the GDemu reads the currently selected "disc" and sends the data to the board. The SD card needs to be in a specific format, but I did that <a href="/old/v7/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation" title="/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation">preparation back in January</a>.</p><p>On the SD card, each disc is stored in a specific numbered position, so the GDemu ultimately acts like a disc changer. The first CD in the list is the default disc loaded when the Dreamcast is turned on. This is where the GDemu menu application is stored. From the menu, you can choose any game you installed. Additionally, you can switch games/discs using the button. Pushing the button loads the next disc in the list. This is really only useful for multi-disc games, though.</p><div class='title'><b>GDemu Assembly and Installation</b></div><p>The GDemu package came with everything you see here: the GDemu PCB, SD card extender, an 8gb SD card, some plastic pieces, and some screws.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It did not come with any instructions, so I was supposed to figure out how everything went together on my own. It's not too difficult to understand, but there are a few things that aren't so obvious. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU">this YouTube video</a> of a guy putting together nearly the same thing, which helped me out.</p><p>Technically, you don't need any of the plastic parts to connect the GDemu. You can plug the GDemu into the motherboard directly and be done with it. However, the purpose of the plastic pieces is to seel the internal components from the outside and allow the fan to do its job of efficiently venting hot air. Whether or not the fan actually does this is a different question, but its best to try and help the Dreamcast accomplish this original goal. </p><p>The first step in assembly is attaching the SD card extender to the large plastic cover. There are 2 tiny screws used to do this. (I had to use a smaller Phillips screwdriver to accomplish this.) <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.webp">With the SD card extender in position</a>, the tiny screws don't screw into it. They screw into the post beside it, and hold the extender in place.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That YouTube video was very helpful for understanding that.</p><p>The next step is screwing the GDemu board into the same plastic assembly. Connect the SD card extender into the SD card on the GDemu board. The ribbon cable is too long, but it's okay to have the extra length spill out of the back. There's nothing behind it that is harmful. You may be able to fold the cable inside of the plastic piece, too.</p><p>The board attaches with two screws. Be sure to put the button into the plastic shell before screwing in the board. Also, be sure not to screw the board too tight. The bigger plastic button needs some clearance so it can click the board's button easily.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Now there should be one long screw, one short screw, and one more plastic tube piece left. After plugging the GDemu into the motherboard, it becomes obvious where these pieces go. The back end of the plastic cover lines up perfectly with one of the GD reader screw holes. This is for the short screw. The front edge of the GDemu board hovers over another screw hole. The plastic tube props up the board and allows the screw to pass through into the base.</p><p>With everything assembled and screwed into place, the GDemu board should be held above the metal shield.

The Noctua fan takes up more space inside the Dreamcast and it interferes with the lid hatch. The mechanical component is a full squared piece and a section of it needs to be removed. Because of this, we've given those other two printed pieces as a lid hatch replacement.</p><p>This is where the terrible print quailty of the components caused troubles. The inner peg is meant to be shoved through the larger peg and create the lid hatch. My inner peg was too fat, or the hole was too thin, so when pushing the peg through the hole it didn't go all the way. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The peg was about 2mm longer, which meant the whole piece couldn't fit into the lid flushly. I tried shoving the peg in further and wiggling it into place, but it was still too long. I used a nail file to make the piece a little thinner and that worked. Although, not really. Now the piece was too loose so when the Open Tray button was pressed, the lid latch wouldn't go back into its extended position, so the lid couldn't be closed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lid latch component is very delicate. It needs to be loose enough to freely move back and forth between the two screw posts. When the button is pressed, it moves one way, then the spring brings it back to its original position. So, the two pieces also need to have a complete strong bond together so the spring doesn't pull the latch back on its own. Using the nail file, the middle piece was now too loose. Why did they print this as two pieces? </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I still had some epoxy from an earlier project, so I glued the two pieces together. The cheapness of the material probably helped fuse the two pieces together even better than usual.</p><p>Even so, the piece was still too rigid in the lid. I used my screwdriver head to widen the holes even more, and the piece finally moved smoothly. Much like the button component, these screws should not be too tight. They should be just tight enough to hold the piece into position and allow it to move freely back and forth. The lid finally opened and closed like it was supposed to after all this work. (This was the longest part of the physical build.)</p><div class='title'><b>Complete</b></div><p>With all the pieces of the puzzle finally put into place, I secured the top part of the shell on to the base, tightened the outer 4 screws, and the build was complete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I plugged the VGA box into my OSSC, plugged video and power in to the Dreamcast, turned it on, and it worked perfectly the first time.

The OSSC translates that into an HDMI signal which I'm plugging into my TV. Even though I just bought a new TV, my TV doesn't really like 480p signals and it really doesn't like 960p signals.</p><p>FirebrandX had created the "perfect" timings for the Dreamcast a couple years ago with the following settings:</p><p><pre>Sync opt. > <br/>    Analog sync LDF = Off<br/>Output opt. > <br/>    480p/576p proc = Line2x<br/>Sampling opt. ><br/>    Sampling phase = 45 deg<br/>    480p in sampler = DTV 480p<br/>    Allow upsample2x = off<br/>< Adv. timing > 480p:<br/>    H. samplerate = 858<br/>    H.

Turning the output option back to PassThru also creates a black screen with these settings. If I leave all these values at default, I get a very beautiful image, but unfortunately it's stretched to the 16:9 ratio as shown above. My TV doesn't have a 4:3 option, so I would need another box that converts 480p or 960p to a 1080p signal and allows 4:3 to be forced.</p><p>Using the Bitfunx HDMI converter does force 4:3 and gives a clean image, but there are no video options at all. You can't do scanlines or change the fuzziness of model edges. I dunno... it doesn't look right to me.</p><p>So, between choosing an imperfect toolbox or a single use hammer, I think I'll stick with the toolbox. If I somehow can afford a RetroTink4k in the future, then that's probably the best path for me and my TV.</p><div class='title'><b>RetroFighters D6 Controller</b></div><p>When I built my setup for the Playstation 2, I also bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver so I could use a modern wireless controller with the old games.

The original Dreamcast controller was fine for it's day, but the controller is really big and clunky. Also, the D-pad is tiny and imprecise. I wanted something better.</p><p>When I built my <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">setup for the Playstation 2</a>, I bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver, so I could use a modern Playstation controller with the old games. Wanting to do the same with the Dreamcast, I looked around for options. However, Dreamcast controllers are very unique because you connect the memory card to them. There isn't a separate slot on the console like the Playstation and Gamecube. So, buying a Bluetooth receiver for the controller port isn't the best option.</p><p>I found RetroFighters, a vintage game controller manufacturer which created wireless Dreamcast controllers with the use of Memory Cards in mind. For their wireless controllers, the reciever plugged into the controller port is a large unit where you also plug in your memory card. Their most popular controller is the StrikerDC, but I decided to go with their most recent controller instead.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Released in late 2024, the D6 Controller looks more like a Saturn controller than a Dreamcast controller. It has 6 face buttons instead of 4 and it only has a D-Pad rather than both a D-Pad and a Stick. RetroFighters' goal for the D6 was to create the ultimate handheld controller for Dreamcast fighting games. The movement of the D-pad matches that of the Saturn, so you can get those perfect fireballs compared with the D-pad on the standard controller.</p><p>All the buttons are very clicky, which can turn people off, but I think the controller feels amazing. I think it's even better than the 8bitdo's M30. This is mainly because all of the buttons are the same size. Super Nintendo games feel terrible on the M30 because the top row of buttons are smaller and more concave. The D6 gives equal size and importance to all buttons, and the button presses feel great.</p><p>Additionally, I wanted this controller because it comes with a USB dongle. The StrikerDC only works with the Dreamcast so it's a single-use $55 controller. With the D6, I can use it with the Analogue Pocket, the Mister, and even the Switch for simple games. (It's excellent with Tetris.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, the biggest question...  How does this controller work for games like Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure, or anything that uses the Stick for movement? On the bottom of the controller, there's a mode switch. All the way to the left, the D-pad operates as the D-pad. Switch the mode to the middle, and the D-pad operates as the Left stick. Switch the mode to the right, and it's the Right stick, which was the Dreamcast doesn't have, but other consoles do.</p><p>It's still limited in that you can't use both the Left stick and D-pad at the same time. Also, the D-pad focuses on digital input, so games that rely on Analog movement from the Left stick won't feel so great. In this case, the original controller would be the better option. But, for the niche this controller is trying to fill, I think it works perfectly.</p><p>Also, as another note, the receiver base only allows a single memory card as opposed to original controllers which have two slots for two memory cards. I think this is because the controller has vibration. So, it's using a fake second slot as a rumble pak. Ultimately, I think this is another con against the controller as you can't do any memory management with just the controller. You'll need a second controller, or do management directly from VMU to VMU.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, I think it's a great controller, although it's not the ultimate solution for playing all games on the Dreamcast. It feels great to pick up and hold, and cycling through menus is a breeze. It's worth the money in my opinion if you have a Dreamcast, enjoy playing fighting games on the Dreamcast and don't like arcade sticks, and also have several other devices or consoles with retro games.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tsukechi Gorge 付知峡" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tsukechi-gorge">Tsukechi Gorge 付知峡</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Once you reach the turn-off from the main road, it takes over 30 minutes of driving on a narrow single lane road through the forest and along valley cliffs to reach the remote buildings. It's deep enough in the forest that cellphone reception is hard to come by.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The purpose of the inn is to relax with nature while shedding the modern conveniences of the Internet and electricity. To become less digital and more analogue. There are very few lights at Doai Onsen and after 10pm, the generator is turned off. The hallways and rooms are only illuminated by lantern at that point, of which there are more than 300 at the inn in various styles. The numerous amount of lanterns have become the mascot of Doai Onsen, so Doai is also known as the Lamp Inn <span class='ja'>ランプの宿</span></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I found this place while searching around on Google Maps looking for places to hike and explore, and with my friends Dirk and Zach coming to visit in September, we decided to give it a try and stay a night. They have a very modern website which made it easy to reserve a room and the prices were very good compared to other expensive onsens and ryokans. Only 15000<span class='ja'>円</span> (~$100) a night, which includes dinner and breakfast.</p><p>After an obnoxious lunch, we arrived around 4pm. There was a bit of confusion on when we were supposed to arrive, but it all worked out. Check-in official began at 3pm, but we could still arive by 5pm. We were sharing the inn with 2 other groups. One group was just a mother and son. The other group was a larger older family of about 6 people. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inn seemed like the perfect size for our 3 groups. I don't know if any of the rooms had names, but we were given the room nearest to the entrance. There were two connected tatami rooms that were opened up so we had a really large space, a total of 20 tatami mats!  The group of 6 had the whole lower wing to themselves, so they probably had probably double the space.</p><p>While some others had already arrived, we were able to hop in the baths first and have them to ourselves before the other groups. Dinner was served around 6:15pm (later than usual), so there was a lot of time to soak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were separated baths for men and women which alternated in the night and morning. The men had the larger bath in the evening. The baths are kept warm from a wood burning stove underneath, known as the Goemon method. However, heated water from the tap is boiled using electricity from the generator.</p><p>There were two baths available. Both were filled with spring water from the mountain. One was full of water that was naturally heated by the thermals of the mountain. The other was from cool spring water that was manually heated. Both contain the natural minerals that onsen in the mountains are known for, such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, essentially). These baths repair and soothe rough skin and cuts by eating away at dead skin on the surface.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love sitting in the warm baths. Natural onsens are my favorite. :) The open window looked out over the gorge with the Tsukechi river below. There were the 3 of us in the bath, so we were talking about things. But, it is always nice to just sit in the bath and listen the wind blow through the leaves and the water flow through the river. There were hot and cold taps for the baths, so I could douse myself with cold water when I felt I was getting too hot.</p><p>It was still pretty early out, but it would've been really nice to come back after the sunset and soak in the tub only lit by lantern light. The lanterns keep the insects away, so you could just relax.</p><p>We stayed in the baths for about 40 minutes and were leaving just as the next group came in. We goofed around in the room for about an hour until the hostess notified everyone of dinner.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The dinner was incredible. Often when dinner is served at an enkai or ryokan, there is usually not enough (for me) to go around. I'm always leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could've had more. This was not the case at Doai. The meal began with mountain vegetables <span class='ja'>山菜</span>, tofu, mochi, and some Iwana sashimi. Iwana is the most common and prevalent fish in the rivers of these moutanins, and local restaurants often serve it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>More and more dishes kept coming out. We had baked Iwana, tempura, and a very large Gohei mochi. Gohei mochi <span class='ja'>五平餅</span> is fried mochi on a stick with a sweet syrup sauce painted on the top. They are usually the size of a popsicle, but this beast was larger than most pancakes. It was so good.</p><p>It was an amazing meal with so much delicious food. One of the best meals I've had in a while.</p><p>With dinner finished, we had the lamp and safety demonstration at 7:30pm. I thought that this would take only a couple of minutes so I could be back in the onsen bath before they closed, but the lamp demonstration was only the beginning of the night's activities.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Arriving in the common area, we were given a puzzle, a wooden needle threaded in a denim jacket. "Remove the needle from the jacket and get a prize!" It seemed pretty easy and I remember seeing a similar looking puzzle on YouTube a while ago where a person removed a bike lock from a lamp post. That was a different solve, though.</p><p>We fumbled around at the puzzle until everyone arrived and began the lamp demonstration. The host explained how to correctly light the lamp by achieving the correct flame size after lighting the wick with a match. The two sides of the flame should create an arch when holding the glass above the flame, creating an image that kinda looks like Batman. If the flame is too intense, there's too much wick. The reverse is true too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He also mentioned that because the wick is completely soaked in oil, it never burns itself. The wick isn't like the wick of a candle. If the flame dies down, it's because of the oil running low, not because the wick is too low. As such, you should never push too much of the wick out of the base. In the short term, you might get the light you want, but after an hour there will be a massive flame burning out of the lantern. ALWAYS make sure the initial lighting creates the batman shape, and the lantern will be fine for the whole night.</p><p>Also, when you want to extinguish the flame, don't mess with the wick. Simply blow over the top of the glass and the air circulation will put out the light.</p><p>We were each given our own lantern to light the correct way. The wicks were already in the best position, so we didn't have to mess with it. After striking our match and lighting the wick, we just observed the flame's shape to verify it was correct.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then, continuing with lighting lanterns, he had us lighting the lamps using the arcane method of flint and steel, the same way his Japanese ancestors like lanterns. We started off with a standard cut of steel against stones. But, if we couldn't handle it, we could use easier steel which guaranteed sparks. Every strike on the flint should try and knock the sparks into some padded cloth, and then attempt to transfer the spark into the lantern to light it.</p><p>It was not so easy. I could not get the right angle or I was holding it too hard. I moved on to the easy steel and sparks were flying immediately. Lighting the lantern was so much easier using the "starter" steel. Zach and Dirk were much better at using the true steel method.</p><p>Moving on from the lantern, there were many more activities. We continued with the wooden thread puzzle, and he continued to give us more and more hints until we understood how to solve it. Upon solving it, we could keep the wooden needle and as a prize, we were given an extra one to give to a friend.

The host said there were more games in the morning, and you can win a prize if you remember how to tie the ropes. But with the generator going off in about 10 minutes, we all retired to our rooms for the night. Each group could take a lantern back to the room to use after lights out.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the generator off, the lanterns were dim, but being out in the pitch darkness of the forest boosted their glow considerably. The hallways filled with the warm light. Although, if we had to use the bathroom, we just used the light on our phones.</p><p>If I was alone, I would have loved to fall asleep to the wind in the trees and the water in the river. But, I put in my earphones to guarantee that I could actually sleep through the night without waking from the smallest of sounds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The morning came and the light filled our room. It was around 6:30, I think? I heard some odd pinking sound, which I thought was water drops tinking into a thin metal gutter. It was not. </p><p>Some of the other family members were in the common area with the host's BB rifle shooting at a tin target in the forest. I went to join them and shot a few rounds. If you called your shot and hit the target within 2 tries, you won a prize, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp">a compact flint and steel set with some cloth to catch the spark</a>.</p><p>The baths were open at 7am, so I went back to the room to gather my things for the bath.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We were on the left side now. It was the same layout, except the baths were slightly smaller. It was totally fine though. You don't want to stay in the bath for very long in the morning, otherwise you'll waste all your strength for the day. I think I spent about 15 minutes in the water as others came and went.</p><p>Back in the common area, more of us gathered to shoot airguns and play with the wooden games he had laid out. Those host asked us if we remembered the knot tying from the previous night. By performing the knot successfully, the prize was a bear bell to use in the forest when hiking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At 8 o'clock, our breakfast was served. More mountain vegetables, Iwana, Miso soup, and other staples of a Japanese breakfast. Plenty of rice, too.</p><p>After breakfast, we continued shooting guns and playing games in the common area and were given <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7626.webp">our bill for our stay</a>.

I think it would be even better paired with hiking in the area prior to staying the night. After we left, we visited the waterfall just down the road, and also visited the Tsukechi gorge which wasn't too far away.</p><p>You can see more information on the <a href="https://www.doaionsen.jp/" title="https://www.doaionsen.jp/">Doai Onsen website</a>.

It is funded by the Mahikari, a religious group (cult) whose branch of the religion (Sukyo Mahikari) has their headquarters in Takayama. Through donations, they have become incredibly rich allowing them to build incredibly gaudy buildings in Takayama. One of which is the Hikaru Museum. Gaudy yes, but really impressive on the inside.</p><p>The Hikaru Museum has an outside facade of a pyramid. Inside, the pyramid is completely hollow with its open area following the contours of the pyramid. There are three main levels of the pyramid and each level has several exhibition halls.</p><p>The bottom floor has special exhibition halls with rotating exhibits. For Fall 2025, these exhibits were the Hokusai Ukiyoe exhibit, the Serizawa Keisuke exhibit, and an exhibit called Pissarro, which seemed to be some guy's collection of classic European art.  The next floor up had established exhibits which focused on civilization's history in the world, Japan, and Hida. And the top floor had a calligraphy exhibit (which was extra) and some other exhibits that were being renovated. You could also go outside and view the top of the pyramid.</p><p>Despite being funded by a cult and having incredibly odd architecture for Japan, the museum was really impressive. </p><p>Entry was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> with a year pass set at 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. I entered the museum for the first time this year when Zach and Dirk visited. And I went again when Jason visited a month later. Maybe I should have bought the year pass, so I could attend some special events whenever those happen. Though, I'm not sure how much attention I should give to a cult.</p><p>Below are photos of the museum and the Hokusai exhibit.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Basilica of Saint Mary" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/basilica-of-saint-mary">Basilica of Saint Mary</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Basilicas are a special designation of catholic church only given this status by the Pope himself. Groundbreaking began in 1907, and the church was officially opened in 1914. Pope Pius XI then bestowed this status on the church in 1926. Later in 1975, it was designated as an official historical landmark.</p><p>The church has still stood for over 100 years, and has become a regular landmark of the Minneapolis landscape when coming from the west on Hwy 394. It is located right next to the junction of 394 and 94, so it's always visible to the tens of thousands of people traveling through the heart of Minneapolis.</p><p>As such, my nieces have seen this building everything they go home from my mother's (their grandmother's) house. I think the littler of the nieces said she wanted to live there someday? In one of my final few days of my American trip, we all went to the cathedral to walk around. After, we went to the outdoor exhibition area of the Walker Art Center.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
