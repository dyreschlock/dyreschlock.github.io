| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On Sunday morning, instead of standing in line to view the exhibition hall for the 3rd day in a row, Five and I lined up for The Old Republic demonstration.  This was the second demo of The Old Republic at PAX this year.  We didn't go to the Saturday demo because we figured it would be too crowded and didn't want to stand in line forever.  Sunday was much more laid back.</p><p>During the Saturday demo, Bioware announced the release of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Steam.  The also announced that everyone watching the demo will receive a full copy of the game!  This was also true for the Sunday crowd!  So, it's installing on my computer right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Star Wars The Old Republic is a story-driven MMORPG.  Every MMO these days has a story but no one gives a shit.  When I talked with NPCs in World of Warcraft, I just clicked through the conversation and didn't read a single thing.  Who cares, really?  What they say might be interesting, but it's all text and presented in a way that I don't care a single bit.  Especially when my friends have already started running down the trail, and I can't read that fast.</p><p>But it's not important for how the game is played.  What that NPC says bears no difference and how I kill the enemies he wants me to.  He should just say, "go to this dungeon and kill this boss."</p><p>Bioware says the story in an RPG is key and it should be no different for MMORPGs.  This sounds incredibly ambitious, since it has never happened before.  It also ambitious to make an MMO period, because World of Warcraft owns that space.  Why compete with the most successful MMO in history?</p><div class='title'><b>Online</b></div><p>Because they aren't.  In fact, thinking of The Old Republic in terms of an MMO skews the basic perception of this game.  The reason story will work in The Old Republic is because it's an RPG first.</p><p>They've basically made a single player RPG with the core focus of story and conversation in all Bioware games, but made it multiplayer.  Instead of making a party of NPCs, those NPCs are now your friends or other player characters.  And Instead of one party member hosting the game, it's all on a single server that everyone plays on.</p><p>You'll run into everyone else playing through their story.  And since The Old Republic has many branching story paths and a morality system you are judged by, the world and story will be shaped by the things that you do and things that people you play with do.  So, it'll be different (to a degree) for everyone.</p><p><b>The Old Republic is really just KOTOR Online</b>, but everyone is playing it at once.  Plus there's PVP and an economy and item crafting.  All the fun of an MMORPG has been squished into the KOTOR universe.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Thinking of The Old Republic is those terms makes me think that it will succeed in its promise to bring story to an MMO.  Because they're actually just bringing the MMO space to a story, which is the right way to approach it.  I was intrigued with the idea to begin with, but now I'm all for it.  I definitely plan on giving The Old Republic a try. ^_^</p><p>The Old Republic is schedule for release in 2010 on the PC.  Hopefully, my computer can play it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Heavy Rain Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-heavy-rain-hands-on">PAX 09: Heavy Rain Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I was really surprised to see Heavy Rain at PAX.  There hasn't been a lot of trailers or press releases over the past 2 or 3 years.  We've really only seen bits and pieces other than what the gaming press writes about after seeing a demo.  Even then, there haven't been many press demos of the game either.  Was Heavy Rain even at E3 this year?</p><p>I'm really intrigued by Heavy Rain because it's different.  It's not an FPS, it's not an adventure game.  It's an interactive movie, really.  It is a lot like Dragon's Lair or Space Ace from the early 90s.  It is entirely played by quick time events and conversation choices.  Though, you can move about the environment when given the opportunity.  I guess, you could call it the modern day adaptation of an old Lucas Arts or Sierra adventure game.</p><div class='title'><b>Demo</b></div><p>The PAX Demo (which was labeled GDC demo) put you in a convenience store.  You're trying to get information from the store clerk.  You could probably get the information with the correct conversation sequence, but I never saw anyone complete it.  After you piss him off, you go to the back to get an inhaler, when a perp busts in the door and holds up the clerk at gun point.  He doesn't notice you in the back.</p><p>You can carefully creep up behind him and knock him over the head with a frying pan or a bottle of whiskey, but there are several Quick Time Events to blow your approach.  I didn't see anyone successfully reach the perp without him noticing.  You need to put your hands in the air or else he'll shoot!  And then you go through a conversation sequence that will make him leave.  I didn't see anyone do that successfully.</p><p>Each time you say something, you'll inch close enough.  So, after you talk with him for a while, you'll be close enough to start fighting him.  Press X here, Shake the controller there, and you've knocked him out!  You gain the clerk's trust and get the information you wanted.  Taa-daa~!</p><p>When I played, I fucked up when approaching the perp.  I wasn't about the put my hands up, so I kept them down.  And the perp shot me through the shoulder.  He ran out the door after that, and that gained the clerks trust.  I would really like to see the other outcomes that were available, but most people screwed up and did the same thing over and over again, so it was boring after the 5th time.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Heavy Rain is a very beautiful looking game.  The only environment from the demo was the convenience store, but it had an incredible amount of detail.  Everything on the shelves had individual labels.  The few ceiling lights cast very dark shadows in the dimly lit store.  It was very rich.  I can't wait to see what the rest of the game looks like. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp"  /></p><p>The demo did not turn me off one bit.  In fact, after playing the demo for Heavy Rain I'm more excited than ever to play this game.  I can't wait. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Release</b></div><p>Heavy Rain is only available for Playstation 3 and should be released "Early 2010", just like everything else that was supposed to come out this year.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Dead Space Extraction Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-dead-space-extraction-hands-on">PAX 09: Dead Space Extraction Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>There weren't many games in fall 08 that lived up to the hype, except Dead Space.  After playing <a href="/old/v7/pax-dead-space-hands-on" title="/pax-dead-space-hands-on" title="/pax-dead-space-hands-on">Dead Space at PAX 08</a>, I was sold.  Dead Space had a very rich atmosphere compiled by an organic sci-fi environment and detailed distinct sharp sound quality.  My hype was vindicated when I played through the game in one sitting.</p><p>Dead Space Extraction is the complete opposite of everything that made the original so fantastic.  It's not an adventure game at all; it's an on-rails action game.  The brilliance of Dead Space was suspense.  Because the player had complete control over the movement of the main character, Isaac, you controlled the suspense.  The player could slow down if the suspense was too much, or take on the situation without thinking twice.</p><p>All of that is completely removed from Dead Space Extraction because you are not in control.  You just shoot monsters when the pop out of walls and run at you.  There's absolutely no suspense, so why even bother.  Dead Space Extraction does not nothing to differentiate itself from House of the Dead, or any other on-rails shooters.  Shoot, Reload, Pick up Ammo, Repeat, Fight Boss.  I'm not even sure I would like it even if I wasn't such a fan of the first game.</p><p>Extraction shouldn't even be considered as the "next" Dead Space game.  It's just a set piece for providing background story in the overall Dead Space universe.  I don't think many people really care about that.  And your standard Wii owner is definitely not going to care about it.<br/>____</p><p>Dead Space Extraction releases on the Wii sometime this fall.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Funny People" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/funny-people">Funny People</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Funny People is an interesting, weird and bizarre movie.  It's not necessary unlike anything Judd Apatow has done before, but it's certainly different and stand apart.</p><div class='title'><b>Slice of Life</b></div><p>Judd Apatow's strength has been his ability to translate real life on screen.  From the teenagers in Freaks and Geeks, to the freshmen in Undeclared, to the young adults in Knocked Up... from the awkward to the serious, Apatow has covered a wide range of emotions in his body of work.  So, it stands to reason that several emotions would affect the audience and hit rather close to home.</p><p>Freaks and Geeks detailed several aspects of my life, past and present, which made me painfully curious to watch.  One of my friends found Knocked Up difficult to watch as it detailed a life that would have been his.  Read all about it in these two horribly written and awkward blog posts from 2 years ago: <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">Oct 27th 2007</a>, <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">Oct 28th 2007</a>.</p><p>These movies and TV shows demand your attention if you've lived these lives, but can lose your attention if you haven't.  Funny People certainly didn't lose my attention, but it showcased lives that were not mine.  So, it didn't affect me the way Freaks and Geeks mirrored my soul.</p><div class='title'><b>Comedy</b></div><p>So much of a comedian's life is in this film.  Between Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler, they could put a real-life name to every character.  The experiences they've shared living together in Los Angeles and performing comedy at The Improv must've given them a wealth of stories for inspiration in a lot of the film's plot.</p><p>Seth Rogen's character, Ira Wright, is most likely based on Judd Apatow's struggle to be a successful stand up comedian.  He writes some pretty good jokes, but he's not very confident and they come out awkward.  His friends and roommates find successes in their careers, but he's left behind.  This was probably the exact setting in the mid to late 80s for Apatow and Sandler.  They probably had 3 or 4 years before Sandler was discovered in 1990 and hired in New York for Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Ira's luck changes when a famous comedian stumble's upon his act. Recognized for his writing talents, he's hired to write some jokes.  The same thing happened to Judd Apatow when Roseanne Barr caught his act in the late 80s.  I'd like to see that movie!  But, in Ira's case it is George Simmons, Adam Sandler's character.</p><p>George Simmons is a movie star, whose life has become empty with success.  He doesn't speak with his family, he has no close friends, and un-married, which doesn't describe Adam Sandler at all (from what I can tell, anyways).  George Simmons has made an onslaught of terrible embarrassing movies which define his career.  Adam Sandler has made some bad movies, but not as embarrassing as some of his colleagues, especially his pal Rob Schneider.  Though, Adam Sandler plays George Simmons as himself.  The way he talks and does comedy is all Sandler.</p><div class='title'><b>Groupies</b></div><p>An actual piece of Adam Sandler's reality placed in the film are groupies.  Now a days, Sandler has probably given up sex with random women, but after Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, he couldn't get rid of the amount of women at his doorstep.</p><p>This is shown in the film when Sandler and Seth Rogen pick up two girls at some Hollywood party.  Sandler fucks one girl. As Rogen fails with the other one, Sandler fucks her too.  He remarks on his behavior as it being easy for him, "These girls want to fulfill their fantasy to fuck a movie star, and I take advantage of that.  It doesn't matter because they always leave unsatisfied."  It's kinda like Sandler is apologizing to all the girls he took advantage of before his marriage.</p><p>I think this is true because this is the second instance Movie Star Groupies has come up between Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow.  Sandler guest starred in an episode of Undeclared where he did the exact same thing.  Though, in the context of the show, it was much more flattering for Sandler at the time. Especially since he wasn't married at the time.</p><div class='title'><b>Juxtaposition and age</b></div><p>Funny People bounces back and forth between Seth Rogen and Adam Sandler equally.  Seth Rogen experiences the beginning of a comedian's career, while Adam Sandler experiences the end, so to speak.  When Seth Rogen is thrust into the celebrity life style, he's shocked and amazed at all the perks and treats.  Adam Sandler just shrugs it off because this is his life.  He's the icon and that how he lives.</p><p>Adam Sandler begins showing his age and comments how the comedic life style is a young person's game.  If you have the talent, you will get discovered and you will thrive.  Horrible comedians don't last very long in the beginning. Comedians make almost no money doing stand up, and that life style weeds out the poor comedians pretty quickly.  You must put yourself through this hell so you can emerge victorious.</p><p>Being able to laugh at your situation is your muse.  And that ability is used quite often in Funny People, almost always at the sacrifice of good film making.</p><div class='title'><b>Technical Failure?</b></div><p>The pacing of Funny People is a horrible mess.  Serious scenes are often interrupted and almost ruined by the diversion of comedy.  For most of the movie, it's almost as if they had an outline of the plot and story, and then just filled in all the blanks while recording.</p><p>The interruptions aren't necessarily unwarranted.  A lot the abrupt comedy is presented as a coping mechanism to deal with the weight of the situation or bring the atmosphere back to something they're used to.  They are "Funny People" after all, so it makes sense that they'd deal with seriousness in a funny way.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, it makes the movie difficult to watch because it's constantly trying to be two movies at once.  There were point I thought were funny, but didn't know if I was supposed to laugh or if they were trying to be funny.  It's really confusing...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>But overall, Funny People really stuck with me.  So much of Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler are in the film.  It's hard not to like the honesty and reality.  Adam Sandler is great in the film and the supporting cast is hilarious.</p><p>At 2 hours 15 minutes, it is a little long though.  As the film rounded the 2 hour mark, I was wondering when they were going to end it.  Is this the end?  nope..  Is this the end? nope...  They did end on a good note though. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check it out if you're a fan of the Apatow crew.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The History and Timeline of District 9" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-history-and-timeline-of-district-9">The History and Timeline of District 9</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It contains several spoilers towards the end, so make sure to see the film first.  The information about South African history was taken from articles on Wikipedia.</i>]</p><div class='title'><b>British Colonization</b></div><p>After the British invaded in the 1800s and began colonizing South Africa, violence continued to climb between the colonials and the natives.  Racial violence had to stop.  In the 1890s, the British ruling party began to groundwork of what would become the Apartheid system.</p><p>It began with the Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892, which limited education.  The General Pass Regulations Bill of 1905 denied them their right to vote.  The South Africa Act of 1910 gave the British ruling power over all races of South Africa.  The Native Land Act of 1913 kept blacks from buying land outside of their "reserves".  The Natives in Urban Areas Bill of 1918 forced blacks into their own communities.  The Urban Areas Act of 1923 gave the white industry plenty of cheap labor.  The Native Administration Act of 1927 gave the British ruling over all South African affairs  The Native Land and Trust Act of 1936 which further strengthened the 1913 law.  (and) The Asiatic Land Tenure Bill of 1946 which kept the natives from selling their land to foreigners other than the British.</p><div class='title'><b>Apartheid</b></div><p>These laws became an institution beginning in 1948 known as Apartheid.  This system would further strengthen in the years to follow as further legislation was passed to refine and tighten these bills.  Segregation continued and was upheld by law.</p><p>The laws of Apartheid would prohibit marriage and sexual acts between race, require all citizens to carry and ID card with their race classification, demolish "run down" black neighborhoods, ban communism (of course), crafted a separate education system, and the Black Homeland Citizen Act of 1970 which removed black citizenship altogether!</p><p>In 1966, these laws were used in Cape Town, to forcibly remove the black population of 60,000 from District Six to Cape Flats, 25km away.</p><div class='title'><b>Protesting</b></div><p>As the laws became increasingly ridiculous, students from all races in Africa began protesting the ruling government.  The tipping point began on June 16, 1976 during the Soweto Uprising.  Students took to the streets and protested the forced tuition.  Police opened fire on the peaceful protest killing up to 600 and injuring 4000.  After that, student organizations were formed for the pure purpose of protesting Apartheid.  These organizations were formed all around the entire country.</p><p>Labor Unions began protesting with the students.  Churches joined the protests, too.  The black and native communities began to unite.</p><div class='title'><b>Civil War</b></div><p>South African security was the biggest political concern of the 1980s.  With increased violence and continuous offenses to the Apartheid System, President PW Botha declared a State of Emergency on July 20, 1985 in the most prominent areas of the country.  Under the Internal Security Act, people were put under house arrest and detained without trial.  On June 12, 1986 (4 days before the 10th Anniversary of the Soweto Uprising), the State of Emergency extended to the entire country.  In 1987, the State of Emergency was renewed up through 1989.  Over those 4 years, 30,000 people were detained, arrested, interrogated and many tortured.</p><p>In 1989, President Botha suffered a stroke and was forced to resign.  On February 13, 1989, he was succeeded by FW de Klerk.  De Klerk made moves to end the political stalemate and repeal the laws of Apartheid.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Threat?</b></div><p>1990 was the pivotal point in South African history that would demolish the Apartheid system.  However, things changed a little bit when a huge alien mothership set itself in the air directly above Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city.  It just appeared there and gave no indication of its plans.  After 3 months with no communication, the government flew to the craft, bore a hole through its hull, and discovered an alien race inside.  </p><p>They were extremely weak and malnourished.  The South African government began extracting the population of one million.  They gave them District 9.</p><p>With the discovery of a new life form to earth, the South Africa population united and quickly negotiated a resolution to the Apartheid system peacefully and successfully.  But enacted new laws to "handle" the alien population.  The Apartheid system was reborn and segregated aliens and humans.  These laws seemed to make sense given they were a completely separate life form.</p><p>The aliens seemed aimless and savage.  Many have speculated as to how they achieved the intelligence to constructor and operate the interstellar vessel that brought them to our planet.  The popular theory is that the population is mostly workers or soldiers without leadership or direction.  Those aliens in power either abandoned ship or are deceased.</p><div class='title'><b>Alive in Joburg</b></div><p>In 2005, Neill Blomkamp (director of District 9) created a documentary of life in Johannesburg.  It's available online on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837">Google Video</a> and on <a href="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg" title="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg" title="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg">SpyFilms website</a>.  The film has been released by SpyFilms.</p><p>Alive in Joburg demonstrates the living conditions of District 9.  The aliens scavenge garbage piles for food.  They eat raw meat from slaughter cows.  The stench is awful.</p><div class='title'><b>Neill Blomkamp</b></div><p>Alive in Joburg was the first work created by Neill Blomkamp, and sparked the attention of Peter Jackson.  In 2007, they teamed up to create a short film entitled Crossing the Line (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q">trailer</a>).  Impressed with Blomkamp's vision and ideals, Jackson contracted Blomkamp to direct the film version of Halo, the popular Xbox game.</p><p>Constant disagreements between Microsoft and the movie studios cast doubt on Blomkamp who had never directed a full motion picture.  Though, Peter Jackson had no doubt in his mind.  Jackson and Blomkamp talked about revisiting Alive in Joburg and expanding.  In 2007 or 2008, Jackson put the Halo film on hiatus and they began to create District 9.</p><div class='title'><b>District 9</b></div><p>Next Year will mark the 20th Anniversary of the alien arrival in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The conditions of District 9 have become out of control, and the government wlll contract private arms corporation MNU to move the alien population to a location 200km away from Johannesburg labeled District 10.</p><p>Wkus var de Merwe is appointed head of the operation to extract the aliens from District 9.  He's a very lovable Michael Scott type of person.  Wikus var de Merwe is portrayed by Sharlto Copley who has almost no movie credits to his name.  District 9 is his actorial debut.  His only previous credit of note is the writer/director of the film Spoon released in 2008.</p><p>The extraction goes awry when Wikus contracts a virus from a recovered alien artifact.</p><div class='title'><b>Filming</b></div><p>Even though District 9 adopts the documentary style of Alive in Joburg, it fills in the rest of the story with traditional film portrayal.  The documentary style is vital for providing the history and information about District 9 and the events of August 8-10, 2010.  The traditional style provides the story of Wikus and his internal struggle with the virus.</p><p>The film's main focus is Apartheid.  District 9 is drenched in Apartheid commentary but it's not delivered in a history lesson (such as this post).  In fact, it's not even mentioned once!  I find that incredibly interesting.  I didn't know any about Apartheid until I read reviews after seeing the movie.</p><p>The social commentary is pretty thick, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film.  It builds tremendous sympathy for the aliens, though "white" guilt may factor, too.</p><div class='title'><b>To Be Continued...?</b></div><p>As the virus mutates and transforms Wikus into one of the aliens, he aids one of the alien pilots into recovering the fuel for the mothership.  On August 10, 2010, the pilot reboards the mothership with his shuttle pod and the mothership leaves earth.  He tells Wikus that it will take him 3 years to return to earth and promises that he will return to restore Wikus back into a human.  The remaining alien population is moved to District 10 and Wikus has completely vanished.</p><p>Will Peter Jackson and Neill Blomkamp return to Johannesburg in 2013 when the mothership is expected to return?</p><p>It seems pretty definite to me.  In 3 days, it earned $37 million in the US, making a profit of $7 million.  With an absolutely hit on their hands and an open ending with expected future events, why wouldn't they make District 10?</p><p>But it might be awhile since Neill Blomkamp has proven his cinematic prowess to the film studios, and Microsoft will probably want to get the Halo film back on track.  Will the Halo movie be put on hold again for a District 9 sequel?  Will Halo be Blomkamp's next film?  Or will they scrap both ideas for something completely new?</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>I'm pretty sure this timeline is correct.  I was paying close attention to the dates in District 9 when I saw it for the second time today.  The video feed from cameras during Wikus' capture and manhunt state Aug 10 2010.  The film mentions that the mothership has been on earth for 20 years, putting the arrival date in 1990.  1990 is also the date given in Alive in Joburg.  Wikipedia backs up this information.</p><p>However, the film synopsis on most film sites say the mothership arrived 30 years ago and the Theatrical Trailer says 28 years ago.  I don't know what the believe now.  Of course, trailers aren't created by the studio, it's created by the corporation to market the thing.</p><p>They probably just got the date wrong.  And all the film sites base their synopsis from the trailer.  Though, the commentary on the eventually rental release should be interesting as to what is actually going on here.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Falcom Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-falcom-edition">Games I buy: Falcom Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Plenty of young people thanks to UW Madison.  The school brings a decent foreign Asian population, too.  Plus, Madison isn't that big, so we're all able to connect in many ways.</p><p>One of these tiny ways is Half-Priced Books, a used bookstore that buys and sells books and almost all forms of media.  Visiting one of these stores and seeing what they have available is one of the best ways a community or region reveals its interests.  I've found old Squaresoft games, Kurt Vonnegut novels, Communications of ACM magazines, bizarre Anime and plenty of other stuff.</p><p>Today, I came scross something pretty unique.  It looks like some Japanese nerd decided to sell his collection of Falcom games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp"  /></p><p>Every now and then I'll come across Japanese games in Madison used stores, but Falcom games?  Falcom games are usually only purchased by the nerdiest of hardcore J-RPG fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Nihon Falcom</b></div><p>Falcom is a pretty bizarre game company.  You may know them best as the developer of the Y's franchise, which first premiered in America on the Super Nintendo.  That's the first I had ever heard of them, until <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908">Retronauts</a> did an episode on Falcom earlier this year.  (episode 66)</p><p>They are a successful Japanese PC Game development studio that hasn't done a single Porn game.  Actually, one of their first games, Joshidaisei Private Stripper, sounds like a porn game, but that's the only one!  Their success has been built from their JRPG franchises: Dragon Slayer / Xanadu, Y's, Sorcerian, Legend of Heroes, Brandish.</p><p>Also, even though you can find many of their games on the popular console platforms, Falcom is not responsible for any of their ports except for the PSP.  They contract other development studios to do them.  It's pretty funny listening to the Retronauts crew attempt to list all the companies that have ported a Falcom game to another platform.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Gurumin</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp"  /></p><p>I've only ever played one Falcom game through to completion and that's Gurumin.  One of those games at Half-Priced Books was the original PC version of the game!</p><p>Gurumin is a cute action-RPG in which you play as Palin.  Palin is new to a quiet mining town and becomes lonely with the lack of children.  She does find a friend, but it turns out her new friend is a monster.  A good monster, though.  Their monster town has been ripped apart by other monsters and some even kidnapped.  Palin to the rescue!</p><p>It's a fantastic game with cute characters, cute dialogue, and throw-back PS1 era graphics.  It would be an amazing game if it weren't for the annoying single analog stick controls.  After spending time with Gurumin a couple years ago, I wrote a little bit about it on <a href="/old/v7/psp-gurumin-impressions" title="/psp-gurumin-impressions" title="/psp-gurumin-impressions">October 17th, 2007</a>.  Please get past the horrible writing.</p><div class='title'><b>Purchase</b></div><p>Of the 7 Falcom games at Half-Priced Books, I picked up the 3 chapters of Legend of Heroes and Y's Origin.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp"  /></p><p>After re-reading my Gurumin Impression from 2 years ago, I think I might pick up that one too.  I bet Gurumin PC looks and plays worlds better than the PSP version.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost in Translation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-in-translation">Lost in Translation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I'm sure I've seen Lost in Translation before today.  Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v7/home" title="/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rocktober!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rocktober">Rocktober!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Though, Tim Shafer had already used that tagline to promote his upcoming game <a href="http://brutallegend.com" title="http://brutallegend.com" title="http://brutallegend.com">Brutal Legend</a>.</p><p>On with the events!</p><p><b>Thursday, October 1st</b> // Moby @ Myth, Minneapolis // <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60" title="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60" title="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/060042E88EDB4EBC?artistid=806872&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60">link</a><br/><b>Friday, October 9th</b> // Armin van Buuren @ Visions, Chicago<br/><b>Saturday October 10th</b> // John Digweed @ Visions, Chicago // <a href="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66248">link</a><br/><b>Friday October 30th</b> // Sasha @ House of Blues, Chicago // <a href="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show" title="http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/EventDetail.aspx?id=367&amp;e_id=66753&amp;title=SASHA__HERNAN_CATTANEO__House_of_Blues__Special_18_Show">link</a><br/><b>Sunday November 1st</b> // Tiesto @ The Rave, Milwaukee</p><p>Sasha, Digweed AND Moby all in the same month!

And then using that to springboard into music I've missed over the more recent years.  2003 Sasha to 2007 Sasha, 2008 and 2009.  I've been listening to it so much that I had hoped I would see him live rather soon.  It's rather fitting that he would be here a week after my birthday. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check out the following sets..

For the most part, I've gone out of my way to catch him whenever he's nearby.  Except for one or twice, when I didn't know he was nearby or I was too busy with things.

"Now!"</p><p>Yesterday, was a beautiful day in Madison.  ...for a protest!  Several hundred (maybe even a thousand) students, workers, farmers, moms, dads, kids, and old people gathered in Memorial Park.  Several organizers passed out information leaflets, makeshift "Health For All" protester signs, and some buttons.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4575.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4575.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4575.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4575.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4575.webp"  /></p><p>I met up with Leif and Caleb.  We just stood around in the back and watched the crowd begin to form.  Around 2.30p, the crowd started making a bit of noise.  Those with musical instruments started playing some "pump up" songs for the crowd.  And one of the guys with a megaphone started spreading the word.  "We're all here today for the same thing.  We want healthcare reform, and we want it now!  Let's march on the Capitol!"</p><p>And with that crowd began oozing down State, and completely screwing up traffic.

Unfortunately, I don't remember any of these people's names.  (With the exception of Tammy Baldwin, obviously).  I figured this event was pretty well covered given the turnout and news reporters at the scene.  But, I cannot find any information about this protest at all.

Were the speeches given at the Capitol merely self serving choir preaching?</p><p>I don't follow politics at all, so most of the information didn't really stick on me.

After the ER visit, he still couldn't afford health care..  3 months later, when he ran out of insulin, the doctor met his patient again in the ER.  He was in shock again from diebetis.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090725_healthcare/IMG_4626.webp"  /></p><p>Next up was a school teacher...

But...  they worked for GM.  And because of the recession, GM would no longer provide extensive healthcare for their employees.</p><p>You may have great healthcare now, but what happens when those that provide it to you can no longer afford to do so?  He had always thought that there were two kinds of Americans..  those with healthcare, and those without.

| July 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Whether it be for inspiration, playfulness, or living the life, Moby returned to clubs last year as a DJ.  He's always been close to the dance scene.  In fact, in his earlier years, didn't he frequently DJ?  Wikipedia doesn't seem to think so, but I thought I heard something about that.</p><p>My fandom for Moby doesn't go way back to his beginning.  I started paying attention to his music when some of his tracks started showing up in compilations.  In 1999, he released Play which I liked.  I fell in love with 18 in 2002.  That Summer in 2002 was the first time I had a chance to see Moby live, but I blew it because I thought $50 was too expensive for tickets.  It's still somewhat expensive, but Paul Oakenfold was there too.  (Edit: Actually it was Summer 2001 for the Area One Tour)</p><p>I've been a fan every since.  I loved Hotel.  I listened to it everyday throughout the summer of 2005.  Up until that point, I had seen all my favorite musicians and groups live, but Moby was ever elusive.  He'd either not tour in the Midwest, or I'd hear about it after the fact.</p><p>To this day, Moby is still my favorite musician who I've not seen live.</p><div class='title'><b>DJing</b></div><p>But anyways, back to the point.  In 2008, Moby released an album entitled Last Night.  It was a correspondence to all his memories DJing the previous several months.  It was a very chill but upbeat album.  It was great to flip on and lounge to. ^_^</p><p>So when he started touring a little more extensively as a DJ last year, I really wondered what his live sets would actually sound like.  On August 2nd, 2008, I had my chance.  It was my chance to not only see Moby live for the first time, but to listen to him DJ!  I was pretty excited.</p><p>However, those plans were dashed by a prior engagement (literally).  It was the same date as my good friend Erika's wedding, of which I was part of.  Even though Moby was a mere 2 hours away in downtown Chicago, it was not my fate.  That night, I did not belong in Moby's audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Wait for Me</b></div><p>A couple of weeks ago, Moby released his newest album, <b>Wait for me</b>.  Unfortunately, I don't really like it.  Play, 18, Hotel, Last Night all had a playful inspired energy.  Wait for me is a pretty depressive anti-war album that really doesn't appeal to me.</p><p>But, with Wait for Me, Moby is back into song writing and playing music rather than DJing.  He's become pretty political over the past year which has taken him out of the clubs and into the studio.  So, my chance to see him DJ has passed for now.</p><p>That is...  until yesterday.</p><div class='title'><b>Essential Mix</b></div><p>Thank god for Radio 1 and Pete Tong.  During the Ultra Music Festival last year, they recorded Moby's set on stage with Carl Cox.  After coming across a torrent from this set, I quickly downloaded it and had the pleasure of listening to it today on the bus!</p><p>Moby's Essential Mix set is pretty interesting.  It's incredibly high energy.  I knew that there was no way he'd play anything but House music, but I thought it would be a little more progressive and ambient given his album background.  If you had me listen to this set and afterward told me this was Moby, I would be shocked.</p><p>But there could be two major factors in play here.</p><p>1) This is the Ultra Music Festival.  DJs don't fuck around when it comes to Miami in Spring.  They bring their A game to the table, and cater to the 10,000 music lovers hopping around in the tent.  The music feeds off the crowd just as the crowd feeds off the music.  It's wildly intense, so it stands to reason that if he were playing House music, it would be incredibly energetic.</p><p>2) He's playing on stage with Carl Cox.  Carl Cox is known for incredibly energetic sets.  With Moby's set leading into Carl Cox, Moby has to bring the energy up to the level of Carl Cox.  So there's a little of that too.</p><p>I was super happy that the 3 or 4 ending tracks were all remixes of previous Moby songs. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>A True Moby set?</b></div><p>But, I have to ask myself, "Is this a true Moby set? When Moby DJs, is this really his sound?"  I'm not entirely convinced.  Again, it would've been nice to see him in Chicago last year to have some context, but that's not fair to Erika to complain about it.</p><p>The DVD packaged with 18: The B-sides, has Moby's entire live performance at Glastonbury 2003. This performance is exactly what I would picture Moby live.  It's a pretty mellow and vibrant performance.  This is the kind of rich ambient energy I was expecting from his DJ set.  It's really weird...</p><div class='title'><b>Finally!!</b></div><p>The day has finally come!!  These past ten years of listening to Moby, striving to hear him live, will finally come to light.  On September 30th, Moby will be touring through Chicago for "Wait for Me" which is pretty awesome.</p><p>But!  He'll be @ Myth, Minneapolis the day after on Thursday October 1st.  I think it's finally time to scratch off one of my life goals.  And it probably won't be anything like how I expect it to be. ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/44">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/42">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
