Once you reach the turn-off from the main road, it takes over 30 minutes of driving on a narrow single lane road through the forest and along valley cliffs to reach the remote buildings. It's deep enough in the forest that cellphone reception is hard to come by.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The purpose of the inn is to relax with nature while shedding the modern conveniences of the Internet and electricity. To become less digital and more analogue. There are very few lights at Doai Onsen and after 10pm, the generator is turned off. The hallways and rooms are only illuminated by lantern at that point, of which there are more than 300 at the inn in various styles. The numerous amount of lanterns have become the mascot of Doai Onsen, so Doai is also known as the Lamp Inn <span class='ja'>ランプの宿</span></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I found this place while searching around on Google Maps looking for places to hike and explore, and with my friends Dirk and Zach coming to visit in September, we decided to give it a try and stay a night. They have a very modern website which made it easy to reserve a room and the prices were very good compared to other expensive onsens and ryokans. Only 15000<span class='ja'>円</span> (~$100) a night, which includes dinner and breakfast.</p><p>After an obnoxious lunch, we arrived around 4pm. There was a bit of confusion on when we were supposed to arrive, but it all worked out. Check-in official began at 3pm, but we could still arive by 5pm. We were sharing the inn with 2 other groups. One group was just a mother and son. The other group was a larger older family of about 6 people. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inn seemed like the perfect size for our 3 groups. I don't know if any of the rooms had names, but we were given the room nearest to the entrance. There were two connected tatami rooms that were opened up so we had a really large space, a total of 20 tatami mats!  The group of 6 had the whole lower wing to themselves, so they probably had probably double the space.</p><p>While some others had already arrived, we were able to hop in the baths first and have them to ourselves before the other groups. Dinner was served around 6:15pm (later than usual), so there was a lot of time to soak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were separated baths for men and women which alternated in the night and morning. The men had the larger bath in the evening. The baths are kept warm from a wood burning stove underneath, known as the Goemon method. However, heated water from the tap is boiled using electricity from the generator.</p><p>There were two baths available. Both were filled with spring water from the mountain. One was full of water that was naturally heated by the thermals of the mountain. The other was from cool spring water that was manually heated. Both contain the natural minerals that onsen in the mountains are known for, such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, essentially). These baths repair and soothe rough skin and cuts by eating away at dead skin on the surface.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love sitting in the warm baths. Natural onsens are my favorite. :) The open window looked out over the gorge with the Tsukechi river below. There were the 3 of us in the bath, so we were talking about things. But, it is always nice to just sit in the bath and listen the wind blow through the leaves and the water flow through the river. There were hot and cold taps for the baths, so I could douse myself with cold water when I felt I was getting too hot.</p><p>It was still pretty early out, but it would've been really nice to come back after the sunset and soak in the tub only lit by lantern light. The lanterns keep the insects away, so you could just relax.</p><p>We stayed in the baths for about 40 minutes and were leaving just as the next group came in. We goofed around in the room for about an hour until the hostess notified everyone of dinner.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The dinner was incredible. Often when dinner is served at an enkai or ryokan, there is usually not enough (for me) to go around. I'm always leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could've had more. This was not the case at Doai. The meal began with mountain vegetables <span class='ja'>山菜</span>, tofu, mochi, and some Iwana sashimi. Iwana is the most common and prevalent fish in the rivers of these moutanins, and local restaurants often serve it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>More and more dishes kept coming out. We had baked Iwana, tempura, and a very large Gohei mochi. Gohei mochi <span class='ja'>五平餅</span> is fried mochi on a stick with a sweet syrup sauce painted on the top. They are usually the size of a popsicle, but this beast was larger than most pancakes. It was so good.</p><p>It was an amazing meal with so much delicious food. One of the best meals I've had in a while.</p><p>With dinner finished, we had the lamp and safety demonstration at 7:30pm. I thought that this would take only a couple of minutes so I could be back in the onsen bath before they closed, but the lamp demonstration was only the beginning of the night's activities.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Arriving in the common area, we were given a puzzle, a wooden needle threaded in a denim jacket. "Remove the needle from the jacket and get a prize!" It seemed pretty easy and I remember seeing a similar looking puzzle on YouTube a while ago where a person removed a bike lock from a lamp post. That was a different solve, though.</p><p>We fumbled around at the puzzle until everyone arrived and began the lamp demonstration. The host explained how to correctly light the lamp by achieving the correct flame size after lighting the wick with a match. The two sides of the flame should create an arch when holding the glass above the flame, creating an image that kinda looks like Batman. If the flame is too intense, there's too much wick. The reverse is true too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He also mentioned that because the wick is completely soaked in oil, it never burns itself. The wick isn't like the wick of a candle. If the flame dies down, it's because of the oil running low, not because the wick is too low. As such, you should never push too much of the wick out of the base. In the short term, you might get the light you want, but after an hour there will be a massive flame burning out of the lantern. ALWAYS make sure the initial lighting creates the batman shape, and the lantern will be fine for the whole night.</p><p>Also, when you want to extinguish the flame, don't mess with the wick. Simply blow over the top of the glass and the air circulation will put out the light.</p><p>We were each given our own lantern to light the correct way. The wicks were already in the best position, so we didn't have to mess with it. After striking our match and lighting the wick, we just observed the flame's shape to verify it was correct.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then, continuing with lighting lanterns, he had us lighting the lamps using the arcane method of flint and steel, the same way his Japanese ancestors like lanterns. We started off with a standard cut of steel against stones. But, if we couldn't handle it, we could use easier steel which guaranteed sparks. Every strike on the flint should try and knock the sparks into some padded cloth, and then attempt to transfer the spark into the lantern to light it.</p><p>It was not so easy. I could not get the right angle or I was holding it too hard. I moved on to the easy steel and sparks were flying immediately. Lighting the lantern was so much easier using the "starter" steel. Zach and Dirk were much better at using the true steel method.</p><p>Moving on from the lantern, there were many more activities. We continued with the wooden thread puzzle, and he continued to give us more and more hints until we understood how to solve it. Upon solving it, we could keep the wooden needle and as a prize, we were given an extra one to give to a friend.

The hallways filled with the warm light. Although, if we had to use the bathroom, we just used the light on our phones.</p><p>If I was alone, I would have loved to fall asleep to the wind in the trees and the water in the river. But, I put in my earphones to guarantee that I could actually sleep through the night without waking from the smallest of sounds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The morning came and the light filled our room. It was around 6:30, I think? I heard some odd pinking sound, which I thought was water drops tinking into a thin metal gutter. It was not. </p><p>Some of the other family members were in the common area with the host's BB rifle shooting at a tin target in the forest. I went to join them and shot a few rounds. If you called your shot and hit the target within 2 tries, you won a prize, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp">a compact flint and steel set with some cloth to catch the spark</a>.</p><p>The baths were open at 7am, so I went back to the room to gather my things for the bath.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We were on the left side now.

I think I spent about 15 minutes in the water as others came and went.</p><p>Back in the common area, more of us gathered to shoot airguns and play with the wooden games he had laid out. Those host asked us if we remembered the knot tying from the previous night. By performing the knot successfully, the prize was a bear bell to use in the forest when hiking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At 8 o'clock, our breakfast was served.

I think it would be even better paired with hiking in the area prior to staying the night.

It is funded by the Mahikari, a religious group (cult) whose branch of the religion (Sukyo Mahikari) has their headquarters in Takayama. Through donations, they have become incredibly rich allowing them to build incredibly gaudy buildings in Takayama. One of which is the Hikaru Museum. Gaudy yes, but really impressive on the inside.</p><p>The Hikaru Museum has an outside facade of a pyramid. Inside, the pyramid is completely hollow with its open area following the contours of the pyramid. There are three main levels of the pyramid and each level has several exhibition halls.</p><p>The bottom floor has special exhibition halls with rotating exhibits. For Fall 2025, these exhibits were the Hokusai Ukiyoe exhibit, the Serizawa Keisuke exhibit, and an exhibit called Pissarro, which seemed to be some guy's collection of classic European art.  The next floor up had established exhibits which focused on civilization's history in the world, Japan, and Hida. And the top floor had a calligraphy exhibit (which was extra) and some other exhibits that were being renovated. You could also go outside and view the top of the pyramid.</p><p>Despite being funded by a cult and having incredibly odd architecture for Japan, the museum was really impressive. </p><p>Entry was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> with a year pass set at 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. I entered the museum for the first time this year when Zach and Dirk visited. And I went again when Jason visited a month later. Maybe I should have bought the year pass, so I could attend some special events whenever those happen.

Basilicas are a special designation of catholic church only given this status by the Pope himself. Groundbreaking began in 1907, and the church was officially opened in 1914. Pope Pius XI then bestowed this status on the church in 1926. Later in 1975, it was designated as an official historical landmark.</p><p>The church has still stood for over 100 years, and has become a regular landmark of the Minneapolis landscape when coming from the west on Hwy 394.

In European cultures, handed down to America, we had always viewed this image as a face, dubbing it The Man in the Moon. However, in Japanese history (and also China and other Asian countries), they don't see a face. They see a rabbit. Since living here and looking at the moon, I see it, too. It always looks two ears flopped over a crouching body fit into a circle. </p><p>I once read somewhere that claimed part of the difference of opinion was because the angle of moon when viewed in Japan was different when viewed in America. In Japan, the moon was rotated counter-clockwise which put the rabbit's ears up a bit higher, making the rabbit more distinguishable. This seemed like nonsense because Japan and America are on the same latitude. The moon doesn't spin that way.</p><p>One night while in America visiting family, there was a beautiful clear night. A few clouds, but the moon is full and illuminated the darkness. I wanted to photograph proof of this difference.</p><p>Here's the American moon shot in August 2025.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" /></a></p><p>And here's the Japanese moon <a href="/old/v7/super-moon" title="/super-moon">shot in November 2016</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It is rotated by quite a bit! </p><p>But... this rotation could be because of a lot of things.

For decades, people have thrown themselves into the irony of traveling across counties, states, and even countries just to see this giant ball of twine. Me too. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The official title of the attraction is The World's Largest Twine Ball by One Man. They needed to add that final clarification at the end because of competition from Ripley's Believe It or Not. In the late 80s, they wanted to buy the Twine Ball for their museum of oddities. The proprietors of the Twine Ball at the time refused as it would've removed the attraction from their town. </p><p>As a response, Ripley's made their own massive twine ball. Some other copycats in the US did the same. Ripley's project eventually surpassed the size of Darwin's Twine Ball, but it was assembled by a team of people, not a single man.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That man was Francis Johnson, born in 1904, died in 1989. He was a builder, tinkerer, and wood carver who lived his life in Darwin, MN. He began putting together the Twine Ball in 1950, tying together used strips of baller twine donated from his farming friends.</p><p>By 1958, the ball has grown to a 6-foot diameter. He would load the ball on his truck for the town parade each year. He also traveled with it across the country to New York City to appear on TV. He stopped adding to the ball in 1979 when he was 75 years old. At that point, the diameter reached about 12 feet. It was the World's Largest Ball of Twine until 1994 when Ripley's ball surpasseed it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In August 2001, the city of Darwin moved their old train depot behind the twine ball. The train depot was a museum of Darwin history, and now it could also house the souvenir shop for the Twine Ball and the many photos of tourists who came from around the world to visit.</p><p>My first time visiting the Twine Ball was a few months before this happened. My friends and I drove out to the Twine Ball on March 12th, 2001 to finally see this thing Weird Al had told me about all those years ago. I was able to recently recover the photos, <a href="/old/v7/twine-ball-2001" title="/twine-ball-2001">so you can view them here</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" /></a></p><p>Every year, the City of Darwin celebrates Twine Ball Days with a parade and festival, live music and beer tents. It was held on August 9th this year, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Twine Ball's creation. I went to visit the ball during the week, though, so I could get some clean photos without crowds of people.</p><p>There are future plans for the Twine Ball. One of the town's residents recently purchased the adject Twine Ball Inn, which had been closed for years. The inside had been completely gutted, and she plans on turning it into an actual Inn on airbnb. Sounds fun. :) But, who knows how long that'll happen with the state of the world.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In honor of Weird Al's contribution to the Twine Ball's fame, the short road next to the park was renamed to Weird Alley in 2019, just a few days before he performed at the Minnesota State Fair that year. While it was difficult for him to travel to Darwin, volunteers from the town were able to meet him at the fair and give him an updated T-shirt.</p><p>I'm not sure if it's actually worth the time to travel an hour west of Minneapolis to see the Twine Ball, but it's a kitchy thing to do if you have a spare morning or afternoon. <br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wisconsin Veterans Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wisconsin-veterans-museum">Wisconsin Veterans Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

For many of those years, I lived downtown with a group of friends, and nearly every weekend, we would go out to the bars or enjoy some music at a venue. The capitol was always there at the center of town, and we would always walk past it, and sometimes through it.</p><p>So, during my brief visit, I played the tourist and took a bunch of pictures. This building does not change, despite the surrounding area having buildings torn down, businesses closed, and more and more homeless and panhandlers on the sidewalks.

I visited State St and the Square and was shocked at how much the place had fallen apart, due to a combination of Covid and people working from home. Stores were boarded up and gone. They were in the process of tearing down some buildings. And homeless folks were everywhere.</p><p>There were always homeless people in Madison, but they were among the many other people walking around, working, and living in the area. Now, it felt empty and ravaged. I don't think the downtown area of Madison was the only place in America that has fallen apart in recent years. (Visiting the city during a rainstorm probably also contributed to the gloomy atmosphere.)</p><p>Anyways, one of my destinations in Madison was to visit where I used to work, Widen Enterprises. After graduating university, I worked for Widen Enterprises as a Software Developer for over 7 years and then worked abroad for them a litlte bit after coming to Japan.</p><p>Widen Enterprises had a history of print which began in the 40s. They first began detailing and manufacturing plates for newsprint and then broke into catalog printing in the 60s. In the 90s, they invested in developing a user interface and backend that would aid their customers and building these catalogs. This move was perfect syngery with their printing service.</p><p>However, with the Internet becoming more and more ubiquitous, print died and their software division grew considerably. During my years of working there, the printing division became smaller and smaller. The basement used to have huge printers for all their costumer's catalogs. As company's workflows moved online, less and less were printing and these printers just took up space. Just after I left, I think the entire print division was disbanded.</p><p>Widen's Digital Asset Management system grew to become their main focus and now it had become their only focus. When I began work there, we occupied half of the top floor. After I left, the building was remodeled and development took over the entire ground floor.</p><p>Even before the Covid years, I think many developers and staff worked from home at least one day a week. And then during Covid, I think everyone switched to remote working. Not uncommon for companies in the US.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, in September 2021, they sold the company to Acquia. Acquia's main product is a line of content management software for your enterprise website. Having a digital asset management system is powerful tool to allow your costumers to host all their product images and use their software to build their corporate website or commerical website around it.</p><p>Over the 4 years of ownership and looking at some staff listsing at Acquia, it looks like much of the brilliant excellent folks at Widen have been moved into more senior roles within Acquia. From other rumors, it seems like much of Widen's staff has either been absorbed into other areas of Acquia or left the company altogether.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the old Widen building is for sale. It is no longer used by any developers or staff still working on DAM, wherever they may be. I think Widen had been at this location since the late 60s or 70s? Some of the other print buildings in the area still look like they're in business. It seems like a blight to have one of the major businesses in the area gone.</p><p>Someone had recently mowed the lawn, so it doesn't look too bad. But there are still some overgrown plants around the parking lot. Nobody comes here. (The overgrowth is much more present on Google Street View.) I'm not sure when they sold the building. Maybe it was still being used in late 2023?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While I was in the US, I drove past many corporate buildings and businesses that were completely empty because of the workforce moving online. I'm not a fan of working from home, but my commute to work is only 5 minutes in this dense mountain town. If I had to drive 45 minutes to work every day in a dense metro traffic, I would probably prefer working from home, too.</p><p>While everything feels like it's falling apart in the states, I think it's a consequence of transitioning the next (or another) form of our society. And change hurts.</p><p>It still <a href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead" title="/toys-r-us-is-dead">sucks that another one of my former workplaces is gone.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Badger Army Ammunition Plant" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/badger-army-ammunition-plant">Badger Army Ammunition Plant</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I learned about how the Japanese people threw themselves into nationalism and made the war more about an attack on their nation's pride rather than about human rights. And I learned about how they suffered as a result. I've seen and learned a lot from the Japanese point of view having visited war sites and museums in Nagasaki, Hiroshima, and Okinawa. </p><p>I've never been to any war sites in America. Honestly, we really don't have many at all because we never had any part of our homeland touched by war. Our military bases are still in use, and if they are decommissioned, they are demolished. Our experience in war has almost always been foreign.</p><p>When I was back in the states over summer, I wanted to visit a location I had heard about while living in Madison. The Badger Munitions Factory was a plant near Baraboo to the north that developed and manufactured bullets for our soldiers in World War II.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The actual full title was The Badger Army Ammunition Plant, and they did not directly manufacture bullets. Scientists and workers in the plant devleloped and synthesized Nitric Acid and Sulfric Acid combined with other agents to create rocket propellant, smokeless powder used in rifle bullets and tank shells, and explosion powder used in hand grenades and tear gas canisters.</p><p>The plant itself only developed and shipped the powder. Other plants and factors in the midwest received the powder and used them in ammunition.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, there's not much to see. Full demolition of all buildings was completed in 2013. The security gate entrance was still standing, and seemed like the only remaining original building in the lot. Outside of the entrance, to the left, was a memorial stone showing the families that "gave up" their land for the plant to be built. To the right was a modern building that served as the museum to the plant and a headquarters for the Badger History Group.</p><p>The grounds inside the fence were open to explore, but there were many No Trespassing signs indicating that lands were owned by the Ho-Chunk Nation. Later, I noticed that not all of the lands were in possession of the Ho-Chunk, and it was okay to drive around most of the area.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I did drive around the area anyways and found a pair of storage shelters. Looking online through old photos, these appear to be a few more original buildings. These days, some local farmers were using them to store hay bails.</p><p>The museum was pretty fascinating. There were tons of photos taken during its operation, many relics from the buildings, and several displays showing the temperature of the times. While the plant's main use was for World War II, it was put into operation again from 1951 to 1957 for the Korean War, and from 1965 to 1975 for Vietnam. Protesters from UofM came up to the plant to protest in the late 60s.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plant really only had those three major periods of operation. In 1977, the army put the plant on hiatus. In 1997, the plant was deemed unnecessary. A series of corporations exchanged control of the environmental cleanup and eventually demolition, which completed in 2013. The land was divided up mainly between the US Department of Agriculture, the Ho-Chunk Nation, and the National Park Service.</p><p>If I get a chance, it would be nice to return on a sunny day. I didn't explore too much because of the rain, and photos looked terrible. Although, I guess I'm not really sure what else I'll see. Search for cement foundations of buildings and take photos? It would be more interesting to take aerial photos.</p><p>The badger museum and the entrance gateway had maps that I didn't fully study at the time. I think <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSY9ZAxLWxwuj23HGyucOjYYmrqSwzvy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSY9ZAxLWxwuj23HGyucOjYYmrqSwzvy/view?usp=drive_link">this map was an early version</a>. Here's a clear one printed by the Sauk Prarie Conservation Alliance.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1udJKEzxvJc5N5OqmTYB3sikRPmvbhRHP/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1udJKEzxvJc5N5OqmTYB3sikRPmvbhRHP/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/badger_lands_map-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/badger_lands_map-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/badger_lands_map-1.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking at the map, you can clearly see how the land was divided. Also, there was so much much more to this area than I original thought. Those storage shelters were still only near the entrance. I didn't travel anywhere near any of the other points of interest listed here. I am too used to living in Japan where everything is so dense, so I did not imagine this area to be miles!</p><p>I think I will try to return next time I'm back in the states.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The museum was an excellent resource of the history of the plant and it was completely free. They sold some books and asked for donations, but it was not required. An old man was stationed there and talked a lot about the working conditions in the plant and safety. (I wasn't really paying attention, though, sorry.)</p><p>I grabbed some flyers on my way out, and scanned them when I got back home.</p><p>Badger Army Ammunition Museum flyer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr7c7QuLElsN15224dVh3CfREuRr1Ki/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr7c7QuLElsN15224dVh3CfREuRr1Ki/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_museum_flyer.pdf</a><br/>Badger History Group flyer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRhghSeTETvOp46ETeJIbAkERAgQGyjy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRhghSeTETvOp46ETeJIbAkERAgQGyjy/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_history_flyer.pdf</a><br/>Badger Ammo Plant - A Different View: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvxlEx6n_NK1LJlyGZq9YyTMDorA0KLI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvxlEx6n_NK1LJlyGZq9YyTMDorA0KLI/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_plant_flyer.pdf</a></p><p>I'm not sure if I was supposed to take that last one. It seems like an original flyer from the 90s before the plant was decommissioned.</p><p>Overall, the museum had a far different vibe than any war museum I've visited in Japan (except for <a href="/old/v7/historical-records" title="/historical-records">the Historical Records Office</a> in Takayama). There was an overall underlying sense of pride of what was created here that never hinted at any guilt or responsibility of what would become of their product. All of the information seemed to focus on facts and presented the information like you could gleefully put yourself in the shoes of the workers.</p><p>I suppose when you "win" the war, you can gloss over the gravity of events that got you to the finish line.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
