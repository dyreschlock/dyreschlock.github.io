| January 13, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lego has released some new botanical sets to usher in the new year. These two new releases complement the releases from summer last year to create "The Four Gentlemen" of flowers, a classic staple of Chinese art representing ideal virtues and each of the four seasons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8527_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These flowers (or plants) are the Chrysanthemum, the Plum Blossom, the Orchid, and the Bamboo, representing fall, winter, spring, and summer. I built each of these while streaming on Twitch, so take a look at the videos if you'd like.</p><p>Plum Blossom: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3H9yfCzeLI</a><br/>Mini Orchid: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9UvKT0Djmo</a><br/>Lucky Bamboo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abEjeij7x2M</a><br/>Chrysanthemum: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQ6zllQfn8</a></p><p>The Four Gentlemen or Four Noble Ones originated in Chinese art over 1000 years ago. The Kanji for this is <span class='ja'>四君子</span>, which reads <i>shikunshi</i> <span class='ja'>しくんし</span> in Japanese. Gentlemen, in this context, refers to an individual that exhibits virtues and morality that all people should aspire to. Each of the flowers represents different virtues stemming from their season.</p><p>In Lego release order, the Chrysanthemum <span class='ja'>菊</span> represents fall. Despite the cooler weather, the flower blooms with bright energetic warm colors. It's generally considered a loner as its virtue is to share joy and shine proudly as yourself withstanding all adversities. It also symbolizes longevity.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8521_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8464_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Winter is represented by the Plum Blossom <span class='ja'>梅</span>. Its petals bloom a sharp crimson contrasting the coldest whitest months of the year. Though, not the most beautiful flower, it continues the bloom its best in a time of the year when most other flowers can't survive. As such, the Plum represents inner beauty and humbleness.</p><p>Leading into the new year, the Orchid <span class='ja'>蘭</span> represents Spring. The orchid is a fragile flower, soft in a form and fragrance. It is often referred to as the most inoffensive flower. While Spring often represents new beginning, the orchid symbolizes nobility, friendship, and integrity, enduring life despite its frail form.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8488_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8485_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The blazing summer months are represented by the Bamboo <span class='ja'>竹</span>. Physically, the bamboo is the absolute strongest of the Four Gentlemen, able to bend without breaking against harsh winds and rain. By yielding and not breaking, its virtues are cultivation, integrity, and loyalty. Bamboo is also hollow despite its strength, which also represents tolerance, humility, and open-mindedness.</p><p>Altogether, the Four Gentlemen say you should be true to yourself, represent yourself with dignity and humility, and also stay true to others.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250101_lego/IMG_8539_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As Lego sets, these look amazing and pair really well with the full-sized <a href="lego-orchid" title="lego-orchid">Lego Orchid</a>, released in the second wave of Botanical sets in 2022. </p><p>Each of these sets have some form of repetition in their building, but it's really not bad considering each set only takes a full hour to build. The repetitious parts will only take about 5 minutes max. All sets have uncommon building techniques and parts usage that you probably hadn't thought of before. For example, the bulb of Chrysanthemum is created using over 30 lego bananas in different shades of yellow and orange. The flowers of the Mini Orchid use 3 handheld shield pieces, an interesting reference back to the Full Orchid, which uses 3 full-body shield pieces in its flowers.</p><p>Each are fun builds, look great, and are super cheap at only $30 each.</p><p>If you were going to buy only one set out of them all, it's hard to recommend just one. My favorites are the Bamboo and the Chrysanthemum. Both of these sets look amazing at both a distance and up close. Originally, I skipped the Chrysanthemum because I thought the orange would outshine the others. It does quickly draw the eye, but the subtle perfection of the Bamboo can hold your eye just as long. Even though both are striking, I think they stay in their own lane as part of an ensemble. I think the Mini Orchid is the weakest. The bulbs on the full Orchid look more like flowers and less like Lego than the Mini-version.</p><p>All of them together create a very nice ensemble. There's still room on that shelf for more flowers, so I'm looking forward to the next Botanical sets Lego plans on releasing this year, and beyond.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okami" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okami">Okami</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I feel like everyone knows Okami and everyone loves Okami, but has everyone really played it? I don't think it really gets brought up in conversations past its art style. That's the camp I was in. I really liked the idea of Okami. I even bought it back in the day, but never really played it.</p><p>At the Game Awards, an Okami Sequel was announced, which put the original game back on my immediate backlog. With revisiting a lot of classic games lately, I wanted to finally give Okami its shot.</p><p>And, it's incredible. (I played through the PS4 version of Okami HD)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearly 20 years after its original release, its art style still looks fresh and stunning. The heavy thick black inked outlines create imagery invoking Japanese calligraphy and traditional painting matching the fairytale story it tells.</p><p>The story of the game starts like a fairytale, explaining a 100-year-old legend, a battle between the ultimate evil, the 8-headed serpent Orochi, being defeated by a hapless warrior, Nagi, and a wolf. The wolf was killed in battle, so the town erected a statue in her honor. Now, 100 years later, you emerge from the statue, a reincarnation of the wolf and the goddess of the sun, Okami Amaterasu. Someone broke the seal of Orochi, which has released you from the statue, so you now explore the land, cleanse the land of its curse, defeat his minions, and make your way to its layer reenacting the legend.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Okami is a very standard action adventure game which feels reminiscent of early 3D Legend of Zelda games. Through exploring, more areas of Japan are opened with more secrets and introducing more characters. Story sequences thrust you into exploring dungeons and defeating the monsters within. This results in giving you new weapons and abilities to expand your exploration in the world and also backtracking for previous secrets.</p><p>The abilities you gain are executed using brush strokes. Hit the R1 button, and the whole scene pulls back to an inking canvas. Move the brush around to create strokes matching your abilities. Return to the scene, and the abilities execute by blooming trees, slashing enemies, and blowing wind.</p><p>Much like classic Zelda games, the story really opens up after completing the initial story sequence, the recreation of the 100-year legend. Evil still reigns in further areas of Japan, so you continue to chase after the shadows of the true evil.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Up until this point, I had not really noticed how much of Okami was steeped in Japanese fairytales. I thought it was telling its own story. I did not know that the story of Orochi and Nagi was an actual Shinto tale until reaching the next section of the game.</p><p>When reaching the major city, you meet Momotaro, try to locate Onigashima, also meet Urashimataro, and swim to the bottom of the sea to Ryuguujou (the Dragon Palace), and meet Otohime. You also meet Princes Sakuya, cut from Bamboo. These are all Japanese tales I'm quite familiar film. Momotaro and Onigashima is probably the most well known fairytale in Japan. All the kids here know it. The One-Inch Prince is another Japanese tale that I had read before and never made the connection to Issun, your companion throughout the whole game.</p><p>I'm not a Japanese fairytale or mythical expert, so many of these things went over my head on their first pass, but it never detracted from the experience for me. All of these stories felt natural within the story of Okami. There are fun references to real lore that really enhance the experience rather than use it as a crutch.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised by Okami. The Japanese mythology, the overall structure and crafted nature of the gameplay and exploration, and the length of the game. I completed a full 100% playthrough in 52 hours. That's the same length as Twilight Princess, which came out a few months after Okami's original release.</p><p>Overall, I think a lot of people skipped Okami because the Playstation 2 was waning at that point. The Xbox 360 was released the year prior, and games looked FAR more incredible than the PS2. Okami released in September, and in just a few more months, the Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii would be released. The future!</p><p>Personally, I was so busy finishing college in Spring and study abroad in Japan for my final semester in the Fall. When I came back in 2007, I immediately played Twilight Princess and then focused on other games.</p><p>Also, as much as the art style is one of Okami's strongest points, cell shading was very divisive at the time. People hated Legend of Zelda Wind Waker because of its art style, and Twilight Princess was finally the realistic Zelda everyone wanted. I think this looked too "kiddy" for the PS2 crowd.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm glad that I finally took the time to play through Okami, and I think more people really should do the same. Now that Okami finally has a second chance with this new sequel, I hope people actually buy into it. </p><p>I'll be there.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Most Played Games in 2024" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/most-played-games-2024">Most Played Games in 2024</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 22, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This was another huge year in gaming for me, although my focus had somewhat shifted from the big platforms. I had begun moving away from Twitch and streaming, while focusing a lot on other gaming projects and other retro games. There were still some huge games this year, but I played a lot of games as more of a distraction from work.</p><p>My year began with my continuation of playing through classic Zelda games. I had played through Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 at the end of the last year, and I started this year with Link's Awakening and the Oracle games on Gameboy. I finished up the Oracle games before the release of the biggest game this year.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/ps_2024_games_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</b> was released in February, and it dominating my thoughts for the next two months. It's incredible that with such an expansive and huge game, all aspects felt hand-crafted and refined. Often huge open-world games use a lot of recycled quests or dungeons, using a script to manufacture its quantity. People argue there's too much stuff in Rebirth, but it's all there for the purpose of flushing out characters, lore, and story.</p><p>Both FF7 Remake and Rebirth are amazing examples of the lengths Nomura will go to retell the overall story of Final Fantasy 7 completely, which has been expanded upon over the 25 years since its original release. Everything feels like it's been completely thought out, even though the pacing is perhaps a bit much. I really hope the can stick the landing with the final game in the trilogy.</p><p>Following Rebirth's story, once again, I went back to YouTube and watched a playthrough of the original Final Fantasy 7 to compare the story. It made me really nostalgic for the original playstation, especially Final Fantasy 8. I had always preferred FF8 because of its characters, but I've largely forgotten it all at this point.</p><p>I started looking into what it would take to play old Playstation and Playstation 2 games, and with several videos on YouTube showing how this was done, I put together a <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">PlayStation 2 set-up</a> to have access to all those games from my high school and college years.</p><p>This became somewhat cyclical as I played a lot of Earth Defense Force 2 on PS2, then moved back to the PlayStation 5 for the recent release of <b>Earth Defense Force 6</b>. Both excellent games of running around and shooting gigantic bugs and monsters. EDF6 is probably the best in the series at this point, combining modern graphics and frame rate with the highest variety of enemies in the whole series. I bought the Japanese version to save some money, which ended up being a mistake because I missed out on the campy English performances.</p><p>After the harsh Spring and Summer, I went back to story-driven games with <a href="/old/v7/dead-space" title="/dead-space"><b>Dead Space</b></a> and <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol"><b>The Callisto Protocol</b></a>, actually taking photos in game and exploring their stories and ideas.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>The Switch didn't see a lot of play this year as I took a break from Pokemon and Twitch.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_3_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_1_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2024/2024_Nintendo_Year_in_Review_2_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Surprisingly, in Spring, Nintendo announced a new Zelda was coming in September. We had just gotten Tears of the Kingdom last year, and already we're getting another game.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: <b>Echoes of Wisdom</b> was the first canon Zelda game where you actually played as Zelda. It featured a creative game mechanic of using objectives in the environment to climb, fight, and explore the world to eventually save Link. Its style immediately identified itself as being developed by Grezzo, who did the <b>Link's Awakening Remake</b> from a few years ago. As such, I bought that and played through that as well.</p><p>Leading up to summer, I played through the remake of <b>Super Mario RPG</b> on Switch. It was interesting playing through both remakes so close to each other along with FF7. Nintendo has an absolute vibrant history of games. Everyone has their own interpretations of those games and how they could best be adapted to today. Mario RPG does almost nothing to modernize itself beyond some quality of life changes to the gameplay. The story, the maps, and the pacing are all the same from the original. Link's Awakening is pretty much the same, too. It's the complete opposite of Final Fantasy 7.</p><p>There's obviously no one best approach to remaking games. Would you rather have a gaming experience that reminds you of your childhood by playing a semi-modern version of the old game? Or would you rather have a new experience reliving the old story with the characters and lore you remember? For this year, Final Fantasy has had much more of an impact on me than these Nintendo remakes.</p><div class='title'><b>Retro</b></div><p>This year, with cheaper versions being release, I finally bought a Mister. This complements my Playstation 2 and Analogue Pocket for having access to decades of gaming history. Many of these older games still hold up quite well without the need of a remake or new version. I played through <b>Snatcher</b> for the first time in decades and it's still an incredible experience, and one that I don't think would translate well to a modern remake.</p><p>I feel incredible fortunate to have access to all these games from my past. And while I don't always have the time to play, I'm also grateful for the time I do have along with a platform to show them off.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Today's Posts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/todays-posts">Today's Posts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I instantly fell in love with this film when I saw it for the first time 7 years ago. I had been living in a foreign country for almost 5 years at that point teaching English, so I felt like it spoke to me directly.</p><p>Ever since I saw this film, I wanted to tell my students about it, and I had the chance the next week at my junior high school. <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Here's that post</a>. Since starting high school, I wanted to use it again in a much larger capacity. And I finally accomplished that this year.</p><p>After watching the film, we discussed the overall story and ideas before focusing on the theory of "switching brains" when using different languages.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story</b></div><p>The film begins with Louise (played by Amy Adams) narrating life to her daughter. The joy of her birth to the pain of her unexpected premature death. A person's life is often defined by moments outside of their control.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As Louise arrives at her university to teach a class about language, life is interrupted by alien spacecraft appearing in 12 locations in different countries throughout the world. There is no announcement from the spaceships, but every 18 hours, a chamber is opened allowing people to enter and have contact with the aliens.</p><p>During the chaos, Louise is contacted by U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) asking for her help to translate a message from the aliens. Impossible from just a recording, she, Weber, and Physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner) travel to Montana to the spaceship. They meet the aliens, but ultimately have no physical commonality to bridge communication. The aliens sound more like animals to us rather than sentient beings. (End of Part 1 in class)</p><p>Louise hits a breakthrough when she uses a whiteboard to write our language and show it to the aliens. Having a visual representation of our language allows the aliens to understand and reciprocate with their written language. This also allows Louise to have a tangible and concrete connection from their language to ours, given her a starting point to begin a rough method of translation and understanding.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Louise and Ian live at the army camp and spend every waking minute working on a method of translating the alien language.

They are finally near the point of being able to ask them, "What is the purpose of your visit?" They ask the question and get a response which translates to "Offer Weapon." This response creates conflict between Louise's team and the military execs who never fully trusted the aliens.

Looking through an English dictionary will give you plenty of words that roughly mean the same thing with small subtle differences. For anyone who has never thought about it before, these differences are often hard to identify, too. Like, what's the difference between <i>talk</i> and <i>speak</i>, or <i>hear</i> and <i>listen</i>? Any English speakers can tell you that these words have different meanings and uses, but can you clearly explain why they're different?</p><p>In addition, these subtle differences are being translated into another language and back. The words of a language carry more than just their meaning. The meanings are often derived from the lineage of the country's culture, and their usage is determined from the society that came from that culture. When the society and culture of two languages are completely separate with completely separate pasts and values, you lose a lot in translation and need more context.</p><p>This spoke to me directly being an American teaching English in Japan. English and Japanese are two of the most distant languages on Earth. At the base level, our writing, alphabet, grammar, and vocabulary are totally different. But, going up one level, our languages are also separated by different pasts and cultures which have created words used in completely different settings with different weights. To go from one language to the other requires more knowledge than just a dictionary.</p><p>Now, multiply this idea by another dimension to try and make contact with an alien species whose planet, biology, and even perception of reality are completely foreign to us.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Language from Culture</b></div><p>Let's look at two specific sentences in Japanese and English.</p><p><pre>I watch TV at home.<br/><span class='ja'>私は家でテレビを見ます。</span></pre></p><p>The order of English grammar has the subject, verb, and predicate of the sentence in that order. The Japanese sentence starts with the subject, but it ends with the verb. All the further details of the sentence are given before closing with the action.</p><p>Overall, I think English is a very <b>direct</b> language. With any sentence, we immediately state the information of <b>who</b> does <b>what</b>. Any other information that builds context to that situation is given after. That information is of secondary importance. Most European languages follows this same pattern, too.</p><p>Throughout history, European nations have focused on outward expansion and conquering. Greeks and Romans, then English, Spanish, and Portuguese through the world, then Americans in North America. Through our history of conflict and war, we have more aggressive and direct personalities, which is reflected in our direct language.</p><p>The Japanese language is the near opposite. Grammatically, the action is stated last. Their sentences care more about the details of the situation before deciding on the action. Because of this, Japanese is often described as an <b>indirect</b> language.</p><p>This also comes from history. Japan is a small island, and it didn't take long for all available space to be taken. Villages and settlements of people had nowhere to expand. If someone was exiled from a village, they couldn't make their own village. They would have to be accepted by another village, but that village would be suspicious of why they were exiled in the first place.</p><p>People needed a way to work together and not cause conflict. Direct language is often harsh, so their communication became soft and less direct, creating a more gentle and nice society. The Japanese language we have today came from these early ideals.</p><p>In both cases, our histories and culture are reflected in the language we use today. This is also true with the alien's language in the film.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Immersion / "Switching Brains"</b></div><p>Louise is often able to read the alien sentences without using their translation device. Knowing about the small subtle differences in language, every small variation in the alien sentences brings up questions about why. Why is this different? What does this mean? How does this compare to a previous sentence with the same mark? Every day, she asks these questions to herself as she studies their language and refines their translations.</p><p>This immersion also brings about stress. She doesn't get a lot of sleep, so she often daydreams about her daughter. Ian notices this, and asks her about her dream. "When you dream, are you able to dream in their language?"</p><p>This overall immersion is the center of Arrival's story.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ian mentions that when you immerse yourself in a foreign language, you're able to rewire your brain to think in that language. People usually refer to this as "switching brains." When someone truly learns a language, they live it. They think in that language and can respond naturally in that language without ever using or thinking about their native language.</p><p>In addition, as people think and speak that foreign language, their personality can change to fit the culture of that language. As an example, I tend to speak softer when using Japanese and louder when using English.</p><p>Throughout the film, as Louise uses the alien language, and thinks in the alien language, she has also slowly adapted to the culture of the aliens without realizing it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Time</b></div><p>An alien sentence has no beginning and end, and it's written all at once without any order. This is completely different than any language on Earth. All of our sentences have a specific order. The components of the sentences might have a different order, but there's always a beginning and end, and language is also spoken in that same order.</p><p>The alien language becomes a visual representation for their perception of reality because their perception of time also has no beginning or end. An alien views their entire life all at once. As they live in their present, they also live in their past and their future. They know all of the events that will happen in their life as they live them simultaneously.</p><p>As Louise studied the language, she slowly gained this perception through the daydreams of her daughter, who is not born yet. Her daughter is born in the future, after Louise and Ian marry following the events of the film, after the aliens leave.</p><p>Her immersion and adaptation of the alien language allowed her to think like the aliens, who have no concept of linear time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Essay Topic 1</b></div><p>My first attempt at using Arrival for my writing class focused on this Immersion only.

Usually when people mention the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, there are referring to Linguistic Relativity. This is what Ian Donnelly does in the film. </p><p><b>Linguistic Relativity</b> means that when you learn and immerse yourself in a new language, you can also learn and change to the thought process of that language. When people "switch brains" to use a foreign language, they're also thinking like the people from that country and can view the world and situations in the same way. A person's thinking can change <u>relative</u> to the situation.</p><p><b>Linguistic Determinism</b> is the opposite. A person's thought process and view of the world is <u>determined</u> by their native language, or primary language. They can still learn new languages, but their thoughts and actions will always be influenced by their native language and culture.</p><div class='title'><b>Essay Topic 2</b></div><p>Japanese students spend a long time learning English in school. Their first classes are in elementary school, and become more numerous through junior high and senior high school. Even so, there's still a gap between our languages that prevents general students from becoming totally fluent. Many of the students still stick to the fundamentals of Japanese culture. As such, students don't have a clear linguistic foundation to truly answer whether Linguistic Relativity or Linguistic Determinism is more correct because they've never been able to immerse themselves in a different language or culture. </p><p>But, school is an overwhelming part of their lives, especially at my school. Students who take my writing course have classes for 12 hours each weekday, and another 6 or 8 hours on Saturdays. All of their time is spent studying and doing work for school. So, instead of language, what about different school subjects? Students who are often good at math are often not good at humanities, such as English or Japanese. The reverse is true, too. So, students answer the following question for the current essay:</p><p><div><b>Which is more correct: the idea of Cognitive Relativity or Cognitive Determinism?</b></div></p><p>Now, the Hypothesis states that different school subjects have different ways of thinking. For example, in math class, questions only have one answer and have a logically way of finding that answer. A student learns about formulas and methods of deriving that answer. For language class, the method of thinking is totally different. Language requires thinking that is far more fluid. There isn't a single way of answering a question, and answers can sometimes be long or short depending on the person.</p><p>So for <b>Cognitive Relativity</b>, when students focus and immerse themselves in various subjects, they are able to change their thinking to match the thought process of subject. And for <b>Cognitive Determinism</b>, students have a best subject or a favorite subject, and because they feel most confident in that subject, it ultimately determines how they think. When studying their weak subjects, they want to use the thought process of their strong subjects.</p><p>So, is it possibly for people to "switch their brains" when studying?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Essay Writing</b></div><p>The essay follows the 4-paragraph structure of having an Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. The <b>Introduction</b> introduces the film, its story, and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. It finishes by posing the above question <u>only</u>. The question is not answered first; it's answered last, in the conclusion.</p><p>The two paragraphs in the <b>Body</b>, which typically provide reasons for the answer, look at both sides of the argument. One paragraph focuses on <b>Cognitive Relatively</b> and how the student can change their thinking when focusing on different subjects. The other paragraph focuses on <b>Cognitive Determinism</b> and how it's difficult for students to focus on or understand subjects they aren't good at.</p><p>In the <b>Conclusion</b>, having looked at both sides of the question, students make a decision on which is more correct. They show why their opinion is true and why the opposite is false. The essay is concluded with a positive statement about the future. What good things will happen in the future if people understood your idea?</p><p>Here's the overall essay structure: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f__nTSmGOkpSRFfPuwdenluPgW5GQXMR/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f__nTSmGOkpSRFfPuwdenluPgW5GQXMR/view">gdrive/Arrival - Essay Structure.pdf</a></p><p>Because the class is taught once a week, the movie and explanation could take a month. Each paragraph also takes a month. There's also summer vacation, which is another month. Students write their paragraphs in their notebook and I check them for errors in their contents, like weak or missing explanations. Paragraphs are only finished when I've marked them with an "okay." With all paragraphs complete, students will type their paragraph in a Google Document and create an APA-style report, which follows <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fe0TK5KawBZIWQMZhKq836d0NekSl5h0/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fe0TK5KawBZIWQMZhKq836d0NekSl5h0/view?usp=drive_link">this format</a>. </p><p>All in all, class takes about 7 or 8 months. That seems like a long time to write a 3-4 page essay, but Japanese students have never written anything like this before. Many of them will never write something like this again because they'll focus on something else in university. </p><p>Because of all the work they put into this essay, I print them out and put them in rail files, just like an American University. I'm proud of all the work they've done, so I want them to be proud of it, too, and have something to keep and hold from their experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here are some examples of student work, with the cover page removed: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fewLzExX3HbqIFMPrzO6WbyAuTlS5bxn/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fewLzExX3HbqIFMPrzO6WbyAuTlS5bxn/view?usp=drive_link">1</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkj5YhLVRNNmgCWkMP0S3_bHaRbCtWHJ/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkj5YhLVRNNmgCWkMP0S3_bHaRbCtWHJ/view?usp=drive_link">2</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fks3eYxoHfL610cXayajQMmKpZqgd5UI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fks3eYxoHfL610cXayajQMmKpZqgd5UI/view?usp=drive_link">3</a></p><div class='title'><b>Debate</b></div><p>With enough time remaining before finals, students can use their essays in a Japanese English debate style format. The class is divided into two teams based on how they're answered the question in their essay. Relativity v. Determinism.</p><p>In teams, they discuss their essays and come up with the 3 best reasons for why their opinion is correct. These 3 reasons are spoken by group members as their <b>Opening Statement</b>. Each team gives their opening statement, and the other team takes notes of the opening statement for the next part. (I also write them on the board and online for students to review.)</p><p>Next is the <b>Attack</b>. After receiving the other team's 3 best points, teams come back together and discuss why the opposing team's reasons are not true. Each best point should have a team member attacking it. After discussion, each team will give their Attack speeches, and the other teams will take notes. (I write these down, too.)</p><p>Next is the <b>Defense</b>, which works a lot like the Attack. After receiving the opposing team's attack, teams discuss why that attack was weak or incorrect and reinforce their best points. The Defense does not reinforce their own attacks. After discussion, once again, each team will have its members deliver the Defense speech.</p><p>In this debate format, there's a final speech called the <b>Summary Speech</b>. Teams would give a speech stating their best points, why the best points of the opposing team were wrong, how the opposing team didn't correctly defend their points, and how their team correctly defending their own points. It's a bit much for students to do all of this for the first time, so I do the summary for them as a way of concluding the class.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Evaluation</b></div><p>Overall, students are evaluated on their progress of writing the essay in their notebooks and meeting deadlines. The final report is harshly graded by any mistakes in print, and also being turned in on-time. By the end, everything should be perfect, so any mistakes are made through carelessness of typing of putting together their report. My class's overall grade this year was 95%, so it all worked out. Only one student got a B, which brought down the average.</p><p>Overall, I've had this film on my mind for 8 years since its release, but I think I can finally put it down after this last year of explaining it, reading about it, and writing about it again and again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo Controller Button Set" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-controller-button-set">Nintendo Controller Button Set</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Set 1 was released last year and focused on the original Famicom and NES. Over the summer, Nintendo released Set 2, which included Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and Gamecube.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Each pull costs 600<span class='ja'>円</span>. Because of the demand in summer, you would buy 1 or 2 tickets at a time, each for a pull. In July, I met some friends in Tokyo, and we went back and forth between buying tickets and hitting the button on the machine.</p><p>My main goal was getting both Super Nintendo and Super Famicom controllers. I did a total of 6 pulls, and got some duplicates. My friends were more fortunate with their duplicates, so after some trading, I was able to get most of them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm only missing the c-stick from the Gamecube controller. (But, I ordered one from Yahoo Auctions to complete the set)</p><p>These things are pretty amazing. They are near-perfect replicas of classic Nintendo controllers, which seem to use the same molds as the originals? Actually, Nintendo is probably using the same molds and plastics for their recent releases of the classic controllers on the Switch.</p><p>Inside are the same membranes used for the controllers too. There's a big plastic slab instead of a pcb.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I posted this now because I was in Kanazawa over the weekend with a student, and we stumbled upon a pop-up Nintendo Store. Out front, they had 3 gatcha machines: Button Set 1, Button Set 2, and the Zonai Gear Magnet set, which was apparently an exclusive pre-release. </p><p>The Zonai Gear are from Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, but they looked pretty crappy and low quality compared to the controllers. Typical gatcha garbage. Skip. I did one pull of the Button Set 2 for another chance at the one I was missing, or another Super Nintendo one. I pulled the Nintendo 64 buttons. Another whammy. They kids after me also pulled the same buttons.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, these toys are really neat as a novelty. You could hang them from your bag, or maybe put them in your car. They aren't really useful otherwise, and don't necessarily display all that well either. But, it's fun to feel the buttons and control stick of the original controllers without having an original controller.</p><p>Definitely worth a pull or two if you're able.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Photo Rogaining" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining">Takayama Photo Rogaining</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 2, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A month ago, a friend sent me a message about a Photo Rogaining <span class='ja'>フォトロゲイニング</span> event in my town. Photo Rogaining is a somewhat new sport that combines photography and running. It's like a photo scavenger hunt, except you are giving specific locations where to take the photos. The challenge is, by having no prior knowledge of the locations, you must quickly determine a route to reach as many checkpoints as possible, each checkpoint having different point values.</p><p>Prior to his message, I had no idea what this was. <span class='ja'>ロゲイニング</span>? I could not figure out the English word this was trying to be. Logging? Photo Logging? But, Photo Rogaining is the correct English. Rogaining as a sport began in Australia. Its first event was in the 70s. The name Rogaining comes from the 3 folks who invented it: Rod, Gail, and Neil. They just combined their names.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The full title of the event was <b>Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining - Celebrating the 500th Birthday of Nagachika Kanamori</b> -<span class='ja'>金森長近生誕</span>500<span class='ja'>年記念</span>- <span class='ja'>飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング</span>. Kanamori is a very special historical figure for the town. We have a statue of him in the Castle Park.</p><p>Head of the Kanamori Clan, Nagachika led his troops as an arm of the Tokugawa Clan and conquered northern Gifu and eventually Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui. Becoming the daimyo of the area, Kanamori transformed Takayama into a small-sized castle town to encourage tourism of other rich lords. He established what would become modern day Takayama. </p><p>So, the event commemorates the 500th anniversary of his birth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Takayama event was advertised around town a little bit. The starting point as well as the main venue was the Takayama City Historical Museum downtown. The poster had a link to the website for more information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/">https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/</a></p><p>There were 6 different categories of participants: Family Team, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team, Men's Solo, and Women's Solo. The event had a limit of 100 entrees, but we only had around 40 people total? A few didn't show up, but overall I don't think the event was advertised all that well. I'm really glad my friend sent me the info.</p><p>My friend joined a team with his daughter. There were 3 or 4 family teams. The biggest category was the Mixed Teams with 9 separate teams competing. The second biggest category was my category, Men's Solo. We had 6 individuals.</p><p>The schedule was as follows:<br/><b>11:00</b> - Reception<br/><b>12:00</b> - Start<br/><b>15:00</b> - Finish<br/><b>15:30</b> - Awards Ceremony</p><div class='title'><b>Rules</b></div><p>On the Japanese Photo Rogaining site, they listed some general rules. It was not exhaustive, so I didn't completely understand everything. Through the course of the event, I was able to understand the rules better, and now I have a much better grasp of what I could've done to place higher than I did.</p><p>Reception for the event was 11am at the museum. At check-in, we got our bib, number, and a packet with our map, which we were not allowed to open yet. Around 11:30am, they began explaining all the rules for the event. Again, I would've preferred they had all the rules clearly listed, so I could've double checked everything.</p><p>At 11:50am, 10 minutes prior to the start, we could open our maps and look at all of the objectives.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Several points on the map were ones I had guessed earlier, but I had no idea it would push out as far as <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kanon and Matsukura Castle ruins</a>. In reality, it's only 5 or 6km away. Normally isn't that far, but both of these are on the top of a mountain. Steep vertical ascents in a marathon are rough. On the other hand...  63 and 65 points are really high values, along with 43 and 47 on the way.</p><p>I didn't have a lot of time to think or compare this to the other points. I know that I wanted to climb up Shiroyama (castle park) for those points. So, my plan was to get some nearby points, go up Shiroyama for those points, and then push off west for Hida no Sato at least. On my return, I would keep north to grab all of those points before the end.</p><div class='title'><b>Start</b></div><p>As the event began, one of the Solo guys immediately bolted to the stoplight and then west. I kept up with him to the stoplight, but I was going east. </p><p>I grabbed a photo of the rock wall leading up the hill, <b>Point 1</b>, labeled as <span class='ja'>えび坂のお多福</span>. Further east, I snapped a photo of this small park, <b>Point 14</b>, <span class='ja'>川上別邸史跡公園</span>, Kawakami's Historical Second Home park?, on the way to the Bell Tower at Soyu-ji Temple, <b>Point 31</b>, <span class='ja'>宗猷寺鐘堂</span>.

It really wasn't that far away, and those 46 points would've been crucial.</p><p>Starting my climb of Shiroyama, I grabbed a photo of an outer gate of the Kogane Shrine <span class='ja'>黄金神社</span>, <b>Point 7</b>. Behind the shrine is a hiking path that goes directly up to Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span>. I'm not sure too many people knew about that. Way faster than taking the road. In the center of Shiroyama Park is the bronze statue of Kanamori, <b>Point 24</b>, <span class='ja'>長近銅像</span>. This is also where I parked my car. I dumped all my extra packet stuff in my car, and continued.</p><p>Before taking the path up to the Takayama Castle Ruins, I quickly ran over to the nearby Shoren-ji Temple <span class='ja'>照蓮寺</span>, <b>Point 18</b>. The path going up the mountain is pretty steep. Stair, after stair. It's not so bad if you're hiking normally, but in a race, it's rough. I reached the Takayama Castle Ruins <span class='ja'>高山城跡</span>, main building <span class='ja'>本丸跡</span>, <b>Point 23</b>, at 12:25pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="fourColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column fourColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>7 → 24 → 18 → 23 // (+72 points / 118 total)</p><p>There are hiking trails that spider-web themselves throughout Shiroyama.

This is my new favorite sport. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-snap">Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Originally released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, it immediately became a fan favorite leveraging the rise of Pokemon fandom throughout the world, and having very unique gameplay that was very easy to learn and understand, and matched the franchise so well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In Pokemon Snap, you are positioned in an automated vehicle with a camera. Your goal is to take good-looking photos of all the various Pokemon in the environment. After you complete a level, you choose one photo to represent each Pokemon species you find. Photos are scored and after various goal posts, more levels and equipment are unlocked.</p><p>Lately, I've been a bit burnt out, so I wanted to spend some time with a game. Just like everyone else, I have fond memories of Pokemon Snap, too. As I started playing the game around 9am, I didn't think I would play through the entire game, completing the Photo-dex before Noon. Man, it is really short. Some games from 20 and 30 years ago felt so big and massive back then. Taking photos freely in an environment feels like something so expansive and never ending. Not even 3 hours is pretty crazy.</p><p>This is the complete opposite of recent sequel, released in 2021. <a href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap" title="/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a> doesn't have a million levels, nor access to all 1000 pokemon, but the amount of replayability from altering course tracks, finding signature photo opportunities of each pokemon, and even secret Pokemon, pushes the game in the opposite direction where there is too much to do.</p><p>Anyways, it was a fun Saturday morning game. While 3 hours is pretty short, it doesn't over stay its welcome. Below are all of my best photos from my play through. Unfortunately, the Mister N64 core doesn't allow screenshots, so these were done through OBS.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Warehouse" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse">Ghibli Warehouse</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 3, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nearly two years ago, Ghibli Park was first opened in the Aichi Commemorative Expo Park, northeast of Nagoya. Ghibli Park is an open-air museum of sorts, with replica houses, buildings, and environments from various works by Ghibli Film. In the center of it all, is the Ghibli Warehouse, which houses a museum, other exhibits, a theater, shops, and several other recreations of Ghibli works and history.</p><p>There are four open-air areas of the Ghibli Park, each require an advanced ticket to enter. Each area is spread around the Expo Park. Here's a map:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp"></a></p><p>In addition to the <span class="orange"><b>Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></b></span> in the middle, the <span class="light_blue"><b>Hill of Youth <span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></b></span> is near one of the main parking lots and the train station in the north. It's most likely the first area you'll come across. Near the other parking lot and to the south is <span class="olive"><b>Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'>どんどの森</span></b></span>. These were the first areas available when Ghibli Park first opened on November 1st, 2022. Since then, in November 2023, the <span class="purple"><b>Mononoke Village <span class='ja'>もののけの里</span></b></span> in the northeast was completed. And most centralized and most recently opened in March 2024 is the <span class="magenta"><b>Valley of Witches <span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></b></span>.</p><p>One of my friends visited the park a year or more ago, and said it wasn't all that special, but this is absolutely not the case. Seeing the scale of these areas in person is incredible. Climbing to the scenic lookout point, prior to the park's opening, and peering down at a life-size replica of Howl's Moving Castle brought up feelings that I didn't know I had.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" /></a></p><p>DAMN. That's it. That's fricken it! The madmen did it!</p><div class='title'><b>Tickets</b></div><p>Tickets for the Ghibli Park are all purchased in advance, online through Lawson. There are 4 different types of tickets available, with different levels of access to the park. The main tickets are purchases 2 months in advance, but there are last-minute tickets you can buy within 7 days prior to visit.</p><p>The standard ticket is the Grand Sanpo Pass, or Grand Walking Pass. This pass allows entrance to all four outdoor areas of Ghibli Park, and gives a specific entrance time to the Ghibli Warehouse. When you buy the ticket, the time you're choosing is when you can enter the Warehouse. You can enter any of the outside areas at anytime throughout the day. Tickets are 3500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>The second ticket is the Grand Sanpo Premium Pass. This also has a specific time for the Warehouse and allows entrance to all four outdoor areas. The Premium part allows entrance to specific buildings inside of the areas, including Mei & Satsuki's Home, the Earth Antique Store, Okino's Residence, the Witch's Home, and Howl's Moving Castle. Without a premium pass, you cannot enter these buildings. This ticket is 7300<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>There's a third ticket which only includes access to Mononoke Village, The Valley of Witches, and all buildings in the Valley of Witches. Because these two areas are recent additions to the Ghibli Park, they created a new ticket just for people who had visited in the first year. This ticket is 3300<span class='ja'>円</span>, and I think it will only be available temporarily for a little while longer.</p><p>The final type of ticket is the last-minute Sanpo Pass. This ticket can only be purchased 7 days before your arrival, and it only includes the 4 outdoor areas of the park. There's no access to buildings, and no access to the Ghibli Warehouse. Also, you only have 3 hours to use your tickets to enter the areas. This ticket is only 1500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>I purchased the 3500<span class='ja'>円</span> Grand Sanpo Pass for November 1st, the 2-year anniversary of the park's opening. The Premium Pass sold out too quickly for me to buy, but there seemed like a lot to do already. There were so many places to go and see. I wanted this trip to be more of a dry run rather than an exhaustive one. My warehouse entry time was Noon.</p><div class='title'><b>Open and Opening</b></div><p>Despite Ghibli Park's website clearly stating that there is absolutely no parking, there was plenty of parking. I think they state this based on a technicality that Ghibli Park itself has no dedicated parking, but the Expo Park has plenty. </p><p>While Ghibli Park is the main draw (and often only draw) for the Expo Park, Ghibli Park still treats itself part of the area, rather than the whole thing. As such, the park is almost completely open. I arrived at around 8:30am, well before the 10am opening time. I was planning on sitting in my car, and going through photos. But, so many people were walking in after they parked.</p><p>Unlike a typical theme park or museum, there is no gate, and no perimeter closing the park off to people who didn't have tickets.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The bell tower elevator was completely open. Just hop in, and go down to the park area without showing a ticket or anything. I kept looking around for where I needed to scan my ticket or what I needed to do.</p><p>Each of the specific areas of Ghibli Park are ticketed, but the entire park itself is completely open. You don't need a ticket to walk around the park! Plus, there are a lot of things you can do and see without even having a ticket.</p><p>Opening around 9am was the observation point. I walked up to the top, and it gave a full view of the Valley of Witches, the newest and largest addition to the park. Again, no ticket required.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>No one was yet around, but some of the buildings were being prepared for today's crowds.</p><p>From the observation point, I walked down through the other path which led to the Mononoke Village. I got yelled at for entering the area even though it was all open. So, I walked around the park for a while and got a good idea of the overall layout. I came back at 10am, and gained entry.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="purple">Mononoke Village <span class='ja'>もものけの里</span></span></b></div><p>The Mononoke Village is an open area designed to look like the Emishi village at the beginning of the film. There is a path that cuts through rice fields, with the village's lookout tower, destroyed when the demon Nago attacks the village. Not far away is Nago itself covered and infested with the demon worms.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Nearby is also Okkoto on the brink of being infested and corrupted. Children can climb through him, and slide down his back.</p><p>Besides the gift-shop, the main building in the Mononoke Village is an old-style hall with a grass roof. The roof has about 3 inches of dirt, wet to the touch, for the grass to grow from.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There is an outer fence surrounding the perimeter of the hall. If the fence had grass covering, too, the hall would look like it blended into the scenery, completely camouflaged from anyone moving by, possibly explaining with the Emishi were so unknown and mythical in the film. Inside, you could spend 1200<span class='ja'>円</span> to cook your own Goheimochi.</p><p>Overall, the Mononoke area was big, but there wasn't a whole lot to do.</p><div class='title'><b>Gift Shops and Button Badges</b></div><p>Every area within Ghibli Park has its own gift shop with general and exclusive merchandise. The Mononoke Village had an Ashitaka hat, like the one in the film, some plushies, and some pins and buttons. </p><p>Every area has a button badge that matches the art from the website. The buttons are only 300<span class='ja'>円</span>, so it's not too expensive to hunt down the full set by doing to each area.</p><p><i>Spoilers</i>, but I was able to collect them all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Collecting each of the buttons was a lot like a stamp rally. It was fun hunting them down, although the process certainly prays of my sense of consumerism. Many of the gift shops have lines, so while you wait to buy the buttons, you're also tempted to buy other stuff too. </p><p>Because of the exclusive merchandise, throughout all of Ghibli Park, I ended up buying things from 7 different gift shops. My main gets are pictured above: the buttons and the Ghibli Park Guide Book. I bought a bunch of other things as Christmas Presents.</p><p>Note: Even though there are photo icons or badges of the premium areas on the website, there are no button badges for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Cat Castle Playground <span class='ja'>猫の城遊具</span></b></div><p>Just outside of the Mononoke Village is a non-ticket area called the Cat Castle Playground. It has a separate entrance fee but it's free on weekdays. I just walked around and took some photos.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There were small easter-eggs throughout the rooms and areas in the playground. Almost all of the references were things related to what cats would like. It was fine, but the playground was really not designed for me. Elementary school kids were the prime demographic, but I think even the older 5th and 6th graders would probably get bored pretty quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>Walking to Dondoko Forest</b></div><p>Having only spent about 40 minutes in Mononoke Village and the Cat Castle Playground, I still had more than an hour before my Warehouse entry time. I went to the furthest area away, Dondoko Forest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's a shortcut to the Forest by cutting through another forest. By walking through the gate and greeting the stone statue, you can take the steep, casual, or middle course going up the hill, and back down the other side. Alternatively, you could also take the cat bus from the station in front of Mononoke Village to the other side of the park. I didn't realize this at the time, but I'm more of a walker, anyway.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="olive">Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'>どんどこ森</span></span></b></div><p>The Dondoko Forest is one of the more barebones areas in the park. Once you enter through the gate, you have the option of walking or taking the tram to the top of the hill. I walked. But, I also got a little lost in the forest. Signage is not so great. At the top, you're greeted by a Totoro statue, and the gift shop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Totoro statue acts like a shrine to commemorate your ascent of the hill. The gift shop sells netsuke, amulets, and charms similar to items you'd find at a shrine with various Ghibli characters. This is where I bought the area's button.</p><p>Leading down the hill are the wooden gates welcoming you to the Dondoko Forest. This leads to the exit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the foot of the hill near the exit is the oldest building of Ghibli Park. </p><div class='title'><b>Satsuki and Mei's Home <span class='ja'>サツキとメイの家</span></b></div><p>Prior to the park's opening, the Satsuki and Mei home will built in 2005, and it's been available to visit on its own since then. I had visited the house in 2019 with my sister and niece. Now, it's part of the premium pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Satsuki Mei home is a replica house like the character's new country home in Totoro. There's the bath, well, attic, and atrium where their father wrote his book next to piles and piles of other books. Everything is created with specific attention to detail to recreate the scenes exactly as they appeared in the film.</p><p>It was pretty crowded when we visited in 2019, but now, being part of the premium pass and how exclusive those tickets are, I'm sure it's much more relaxed and open.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="orange">Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></span></b></div><p>Having finished the Dondoko area, I walked back to the center of the park and waited in line for the Warehouse. My entry time was Noon, and the time was 11:30am.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Ghibli Warehouse is one of the key areas of the park. It's like an expanded version of the <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-museum" title="/ghibli-museum">Ghibli Museum</a> near Tokyo. You get a ticket to watch an exclusive Ghibli Film. There are areas showcasing the creativity and history of Ghibli. And, much like the rest of the park, tons of areas that replicate scenes and characters from Ghibli Film's library of works.</p><p>There is so much here. I'm going to make a separate post about it. You can look at the <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse">photos</a> now, though, if you'd like.</p><p>Ultimately, I stayed in the warehouse for over 2 hours. 20 minutes of that was waiting in line at the gift shop. I got my button, plus other gifts.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="magenta">Valley of Witches <span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></span></b></div><p>It began raining, but, next, it was finally time to visit the other key area of the park, the Valley of Witches. This area focuses on the works of Ghibli Film that specifically deal with magic, namely Kiki's Delivery Service, Earwig and the Witch, and Howl's Moving Castle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Connected to the entrance, is The Flying Oven, a full service restaurant with many dishes and treats, like the ones you've seen in Ghibli Film. Maybe an oversight on my part, but I did not eat anything in the park, at all. I had a pizza in my car from visiting Costco the day before, so I already had more food than I needed. I'll do more of a food journey on my next trip.</p><p>The road leading into the main area slowly reveals more and more buildings of the town. The first building is The Witch's Home, from Earwig and the Witch. This is the home where Bella Yaga and Mandarake live, and bring Earwig after they adopt her. This home is part of the premium pass, so I could not enter.</p><p>The road continues passed a fountain and some more buildings. There's a building with a confusing layout that is inspired by a boy who dreams of flying, like the puzzles in Laputa or Kiki. I didn't really notice any strong references. </p><p>Next to this building is the valley's Clock Tower. The Clock Tower sits at the edge of ruins from a possibly city, leading to Howl's Moving Castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Howl's Moving Castle was magnificent. While it's not one of my favorites, it's still a film that I treasure and have fond memories of watching it with friends and family across different eras of my life. Seeing this one-to-one scale recreation of the mythical building was inspiring. Visiting the inside would probably bring up even more feelings. But, premium only.</p><p>While Howl's Moving Castle is the crown jewel of the park looking from the Outside, the Okino Residence is the other treasure, but more from the inside. Also, premium only.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Okino Residence is Kiki's childhood home. This is where she lived before leaving on her journey and training to become a witch in the city of Koriko. Looking at photos online, there are beautiful rooms, like her mother's potion laboratory, the witch's shop, kitchen, and bedrooms.</p><p>Going back into the main town is the Guuchoki Bakery where Kiki lived with the Osono family. Connected to the bakery, is the Hatter's Hat Shop (from Howl), which sells hats and candy, the Witch's Bookshelf on the second floor, with various books about magic, and Sophie's workshop also on the second floor. </p><p>Nearby is a Hot Dog stand selling hot dogs with buns that look like cat's paws. They also sell beer, apparently. (Man, I need to back). On the way out of the Valley Witches is the main gift store, Thirteen Witches. This is where I bought the button.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="light_blue">Hill of Youth <span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></span></b></div><p>The final area that I had yet to visit was the Hill of Youth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are two buildings here. The main one is the antique shop from Whisper of the Heart. The ground floor is filled with antiques, and the second floor is filled with mechanical clocks and materials for creating violins. The inside of the building is premium only, and the gift shop is inside, too. In order to get my final button, I had to ask one of attendants and she escorted me inside to the store to quickly buy it.</p><p>The other building of the Hill of Youth is the Cat Office from The Cat Returns, the spin-off film to Whisper of the Heart. It's a small "cat-sized" building you can only view by peering through the windows. Inside, the Baron meets with Muta.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Without a premium pass, this area is pretty empty.</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Park</b></div><p>Overall, Ghibli Park is pretty incredible. With all the terrible shit in the world, it's amazing that there's a place you can visit that brings you back to those pure feelings of creativity and wonder that Ghibli Films so often inspire. I suppose this is how people felt when visiting Disney Land, 30 or 40 years ago, before it went bad. </p><p>While the Premium Tickets are pretty expensive, exclusive, and also gate some of the best parts of the park, the other passes aren't all that expensive and relatively easy to buy. In fact, the outdoor-only pass at only 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> available 7 days before arrival is an excellent last minute purchase for your trip to Japan.</p><p>Actually, after writing up this post and looking at the things I missed (like the food and beer), I may just buy one of those 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> passes and go back there over winter vacation on a day with really good weather. It's a really easy day trip for me.</p><p>I would definitely recommend a visit, and I would also recommend this over the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. There is way more to do in Ghibli Park and tickets are easier to get.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
