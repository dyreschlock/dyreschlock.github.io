This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.</p><p>In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.</p><p>As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack? Did he give the command to invade?</p><p>This is the overall plot of the 2012 film, Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as Bonner Fellers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp"/></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>General Bonner Fellers</b></div><p>The film focuses on Bonner Fellers. MacArthur entrusts Fellers with this mission of determining the Emperor's guilt because of Fellers close relation and expertise of Japan. After arriving in Tokyo, various members of the Japanese military are arrested, and Fellers oversees the operation understanding how these officers value sacrifice in the wake of defeat.</p><p>The arrested officers are interrogated and seemingly uncooperative. Fellers understands the ambiguity of their answers, but is still frustrated with the lack of substantial proof and direct answers required for making a clear decision to MacArthur.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp"></a></p><p>One of my initial favorite things about Emperor was Feller's frustration. Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. </p><p>This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time. This feeling of working towards the same goal as others, but being pushed aside because I'm a perceived outsider, thus being perceived as an opponent or someone that wouldn't understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Honne and Tatemae <span class='ja'>本音と建前</span></b></div><p>After watching the film recently with my Japanese language students, I had forgotten that it spent some time explaining Japanese culture. One of the key points of the film was a flashback between Fellers and his fictional girlfriend's uncle, General Kajima. The uncle explains <b>Honne</b> and <b>Tatemae</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp"></a></p><p><b>Tatemae</b> is the way that things appear. The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. <b>Honne</b> is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.</p><p>This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.</p><p>That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.</p><p>Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"</p><div class='title'><b>Group Harmony formed from Ancient History</b></div><p>I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. </p><p>Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.</p><p>As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.</p><p>Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. </p><p>In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.</p><div class='title'><b>Direct and Indirect Language</b></div><p>You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.</p><p>In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.</code></p><p>We always want to know <code>who</code> is doing <code>what</code> when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.</p><p>Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は</span> <span class='ja'>毎日</span> <span class='ja'>学校に</span> <span class='ja'>歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.</p><p>Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "<span class='ja'>すみません、ちょっと。。</span>" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.</p><p>The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.</p><p>Anyways... back to Emperor.</p><div class='title'><b>Dai-Ichi Life Building <span class='ja'>第一生命</span></b></div><p>As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds. From a story perspective, the location is perfectly fine, but the imagery and location are factual incorrect, and the location sometimes seems to move depending on what's happening in the film.</p><p>We see the Dai-Ichi Life building in the first sequence of the film as MacArthur and Fellers arrive. It's made to look more oriental and aged compared to how it actual looked. On the left is a composite image from the film, compared to the image on the right, which is apparently a photo of the building from 1945, taken from <a href="https://www.oldtokyo.com/dai-ichi-seimei-sogo-building-marunouchi-c-1949/" title="https://www.oldtokyo.com/dai-ichi-seimei-sogo-building-marunouchi-c-1949/">oldtokyo.com</a>.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I guess they didn't want the building looking modern for the film? Or, the real building looked too western or too Washington? My composite image is a little goofy, but much of the perspective of the building is off, too.</p><p>The Dai-Ichi Life building is still standing today in Tokyo in the same spot it has been since it was built in 1933. There have been some additions to the roof. Also, the original building acts as a front to a 21-story office building, which was completed in 1993.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside the Dai-Ichi Building, MacArthur's office is still preserved as it was 80 years ago.

Story Telling</b></div><p>Overall, Emperor takes a lot of liberties with history in order to tell its story. Some of the smaller ones have been covered already, but the biggest inaccuracy is the love story between Fellers and Shimada Aya. Their story is completely fictional as Fellers was already married to Dorothy Dysart in 1925. They stayed married with 3 children until Feller's death in 1973.</p><p>The overall love story was most likely added to make the story relatable to general audience. Do people really want another boring historical drama based on facts? If Fellers has "love" for Japan, we gotta show that love somehow. Love for a woman is the easiest way to do this. Plus, people like a good tragic love story. Let's do that.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Critics hated this part of the story because it was so cliche. They also felt that the film focused on their love story too much when they had a wealth of history to draw story from.</p><p>But, for someone that knows nothing of the subject matter, I think the movie does well portraying the events in the film and introducing the audience to these events that were pivotal in created modern Japan. It also does well introducing people to some parts of Japanese culture they probably aren't familiar with. So many war movies focus on heroes in battle and show the horror of war. Very very few films focus on creating peace through reconciliation rather than fighting.</p><p>Emperor is a fantastic under appreciated film.</p><div class='title'><b>Imperial Palace <span class='ja'>皇居</span></b></div><p>After showing the palace guards MacArthur's approval, Fellers enters the Palace and interviews Sekiya.

Around 9:30am, they allowed tour members to enter the Kikyo-mon Gate and wait at the visitor center for orientation. They explained the route of the tour, and had pamphlets available. Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it.

Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.</p><p>It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Tour</b></div><p>Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.</p><p>The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.</p><p>I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ema Market at Yamazakura 山桜神社" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ema-market-at-yamazakura">Ema Market at Yamazakura 山桜神社</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

People have these paintings created to bring luck and protection to a person's family or business through the upcoming year. This tradition began several hundred years ago, when farmers would bring their horses to the <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kannon Temple</a> <span class='ja'>松倉観音</span> on nearby Matsukura mountain to pray to Kannon for their protection. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /></p><p>The Matsukura Kannon Temple was first established in the 1690s by a Buddhist Monk named Tenden Koutou <span class='ja'>天電高幢</span>. Kannon is a Buddhist with six transformations, and the Matsukura Temple specifically worships Bato Kannon  <span class='ja'>馬頭観音</span>, the horse-headed transformation of Kannon. </p><p>Traditionally, the Hida region has been populated by farmers, so horses were a very important part of their lives. They were used in their farm work for cultivating their fields and transporting food to town. They were also needed to travel the long distance up north or down south. People considered them part of their family. As such, their stables were connected to their houses at the front door.</p><p>Each year on July 9th, people would bring their horses to the Matsukura Temple to have their horse blessed by the monks of Bato Kannon. 400 years ago, traveling up the Matsukura mountain to reach the temple was difficult, and horses were often injured. As the custom grew in popularity, it became even more troublesome to bring horses up the mountain.</p><p>Because of this, Emas <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> were created. Rather than bringing your physical horse up the mountain, you could buy a painting of your horse, have the monks bless the painting, and receive the same protection and fortune. People would hang the painting near their front door, near their horse's stable. Over time, these paintings have come to represent general good luck. As the horse faces inwards, it would bring you good luck to your home or business.</p><p>In <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">previous years</a>, I've gone up the Matsukura mountain to visit the Kannon Temple and get a horse painting. But, that's not the only place that makes these paintings.</p><div class='title'><b>Yamazakura Shrine <span class='ja'>山桜神社</span></b></div><p>Yamazakura Shrine is a small shrine on Honmachi street, one of the main streets in Takayama. It is squished between two restaurants. Despite being centrally located, it's perhaps more annoying to reach than the Kannon Temple on the mountain because there's no parking (for free) around the area. Although old people just park in the middle of the street anyway.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yamazakura Shrine is named after a local horse that became a legend. Yamazakura <span class='ja'>山桜</span> was born in the town of Nyukawa (NE town of Takayama) and became the horse of Kanamori Yorinao <span class='ja'>金森頼直</span>, the reigning ruler of Takayama at the time, great grandson of Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, who established modern Takayama. Yorinao was in Edo when the Great Fire of Edo happened in 1657. Yorinao was completely engulfed in flames in his guest house. The story goes that Yamazakura burst through the door allowing Yorinao to get on his back. The horse rushed out of the building and leaped into the river extinguishing the flames saving his life.</p><p>Yorinao was so grateful to his horse. He established the horse's stable in downtown Takayama on Honmachi street so the people of Takayama would look after him and treat him with respect. After Yamazakura's death, he was cremated and ashes spread at the foot of Mt. Matsukura on the path to the Kannon Temple. At the location of the stable, Yamazakura Shrine <span class='ja'>山桜神社</span> was established. Besides praying to Bato Kannon for protection and prosperity, the shrine specializes in protection from fire.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema Market <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Every year, the Yamazakura Shrine advertises in the town newsletter and I often see these advertisements around the shrine when I drive by. Rather than go to Matsukura Kannon, I wanted to visit a different Ema distributer this year.</p><p><p class="img"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link"><img style="height: 724px; width: 512; text-align: center;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" /></a></p></p><p>Yamazakura and Bato Kannon are celebrated on August 8th, 9th, and 10th each year at the Yamazakura shrine, but the shrine is open from August 1st to 10th at 10am to 3pm each day. I had time to visit on August 7th before class in the evening. You're able to make an order <a href="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html" title="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html">online</a> prior to visiting. But, if you just show up, they don't have a standard order form, like the Kannon temple. You just tell them your name, the Ema size, what color (black/white), and which way it should face (left/right). The small painting was 1800yen.</p><p>Because the shrine is so small, they only let a few people in at a time.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There are a few different designs beyond just the color of the horse, I think for different luck.

| July 17, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Late last year, English gaming company 8bitmods released a device called the <b>MemCard Pro 2</b>. It is advertised as "the last memory card you'll ever need." It works for both Playstation 1 and Playstation 2, and it stores all of its data for memory on an SD card. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After putting together my <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2 set up</a>, I wanted some way of being able to backup all of my save data from my decade of playing the Playstation 1 and 2. Having a memory card that uses an SD card was what I wanted, and I found this.</p><p>But, it does MUCH more than just store save files on an SD card. It has a paging system, so you can easily create a new card with the press of a button. It identifies games with Game Id, so it can create unique memory cards for each game. And the card has Wifi, so all of its functions can be controlled by a web interface!</p><div class='title'><b>Updating</b></div><p>Before doing anything, you need an SD card. Each PS2 memory card is 8mb so even having an SD card with 128gb of space is massive over kill. I bought a 64gb Samsung card for around $10 since it seemed to be the cheapest option. 32gb cards were available, but they were around the same price. May as well get a slightly large one. The SD card must be formatted either FAT32 or ExFat. I went with ExFat.</p><p>With the card ready to go, the next necessary step is firmware. You should update to the most recent version for access to all of the current features. Here's the link to the firmware:<br/><a href="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public" title="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public">Latest Firmware Download</a></p><p>Put the SD card in the MemCard and put the MemCard in the PS2. Power it on, and it'll start updating. When finished, it is ready to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Wi-Fi</b></div><p>You may think that Wi-Fi is unnecessary for a memory card, but you have so many more methods of control than being limited to the 2-button, small screen interface attached to the PS2. When you want to change card, you can easily do it with a scroll and a click in a web browser.</p><p>Setting up the Wi-Fi has a few steps that are pretty easy. First, you need to hold down the Left button and release to enter the Menu. Click down to Wi-Fi and select it. You'll be given an IP address. Now, the memcard pro is broadcasting as an access point. It wants you to connect to the access point and visit the webpage at that IP address. Going to that IP address will open a webpage to complete the Wi-Fi set up.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In the Setup Wizard, you'll choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to.

You can further set up which memory card should be selected by default when the console powers up. And, you can set up cloud backup with Google Drive. You can also update the firmware from here, too, rather than doing it manually.</p><div class='title'><b>Save Management</b></div><p>One of the best features of the Memcard is identifying games using Game_Id. Every disc printed and created for a Playstation 1 and 2 has a unique Game_Id associated with it and the Memcard can identify this ID and automatically create or switch to a virtual memory card used only for that game. It does this by default, but you can change this behavior in the settings.</p><p>That means that you don't need to worry about trying to find which cards have which saves. You also don't have to worry about space on a card because other games won't be there to fill the space. And, even if you do save a lot in one game and use up all of the space, you can create a new page and have up to 8 memory cards for each game.</p><p>All memory cards are stored as virtual drives in the <code>mcd</code> format on the SD card. Unfortunately, you can't modify the contents of the card directly on a PC. So, if you want to add stuff on the card directly, you still need to use uLaunchELF on the PS2.</p><p>There might be something out there that will mount of the drive and give you access because people have written scripts and programs that access the contents of the cards for Save Splitting. But, I haven't found anything yet. Save Splitting is useful when moving the contents of your current memory card stash into the Memcard.</p><div class='title'><b>Transferring Old Memory Cards</b></div><p>I have an old plastic bag full of memory cards from the late 90s and 2000s. The bulk of these are Playstation 1 cards, but there are some Playstation 2 cards, too. As well as Dreamcast, N64, and Gamecube.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In total, I have eleven Playstation 1 cards, a Pocketstation, and six Playstation 2 cards. I want to move all of this data onto my SD card. It'd be nice if the Memcard Pro2 had an option to copy a Memory Card directly, but we have to copy over everything manually. From there, we have to use Save Splitting programs to separate and sort all of the saves into their own memory cards.</p><p>Overall, this is a 2-step process for both Playstation 1 and 2, and the first step is identical for both: we need to manually transfer all Memory Card saves from one memory card to another. This is normally done using the Playstation browser, and I think it's the fastest method for Playstation 1. But for Playstation 2, it's much faster to use uLaunchELF and move all of the file contents.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>With uLaunchELF, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card is slot 1, and <code>mc1</code> is slot 2.

The script relies on program called <code>mymc</code> created by another developer, gastroman. As the description says, you can download that program here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/">sourceforget/mymc</a>. All contents of mymc distribution should be placed in the <code>mymc</code> folder.</p><p>The save-splitter distribution has an <code>import</code> and an <code>export</code> folder. Pretty self-explanatory. Put all your saves in the import folder, run the script, and all of the split saves will be in the export folder. </p><p>The script is run from a PowerShell instance and you need to Run it as an Administrator, since it'll be moving and editing files.

It's a device created from a community standard that converts analog video signals into digital signals, primarily for retro video game consoles. It has 3 inputs, SCART, component, and VGA, and will output HDMI. I'm primary using this with a Playstation 2, but the Analogue Pocket's Analogizer is also hooked up to it. I recently got mine from AliExpress for $90. Then I bought an acrylic outer case for $20.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The era of the Playstation 2 was the last video game generation to use analog video signals as a standard. Starting with the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, consoles natively supported HDMI, and now its standard on absolutely everything. Prior to HDMI, RCA composite cables were standard in North America and Japan, while SCART was standard in Europe. But, for North America, the highest quality video you could get used RGB composite cables.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2 Component Cables</b></div><p>For the Playstation 2, the official component cables are one of the best options. But the actual official ones are hard to find and usually expensive. Also, there are many bootlegs cables being sold as official. Signal integrity is very important to analog video, so cheap cables can eat away at the quality. So, the actual best PS2 video cables on the market are the cables from Retrovision.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think they look cheap on the outside, but the internals are not. The inner components are perfectly shielded and expertly crafted to ensure the highest quality, strongest signal possible from source to destination. They were $30 on Amazon, not too much more expensive than others.</p><div class='title'><b>Signals and Resolutions</b></div><p>For the most part, by default, the Playstation 2 outputs a 480i resolution. In general, this is a 640x480 resolution drawn with interlacing. I'm not an expert, but I have come to understand that interlacing draws the video with overlapping alternating lines. A complete single frame is split into two images alternatingly drawn on top of each other, which creates two frames instead one.</p><p>Modern TVs with HDMI use progressive scan to draw the image on a TV. A single frame is drawn from top to bottom in order without alternating lines. Some Playstation 2 games have the option of output 480p, where p stands for progressive. The OSSC loves a 480p signal because, even though it is being passed as an analog signal, it's in a digital format, and that's what modern TVs want.</p><p>The 480i signal is more annoying. The OSSC needs to convert the interlaced signals into progressive, and it uses bob deinterlacing to do this. Bob deinterlacing takes the half-drawn image from the first frame and treats it as progressive. It's only 240 tall, so it doubles the height. Then it does the same with the next frame, the other half of the image. Another name for this technique is line doubling.</p><p>So, we want to set up the OSSC to handle <b>480p</b> and <b>480i</b> signals.</p><p>People have made a list of all Playstation 2 games that support 480p (and other resolutions) and how to enable it.<br/><a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes" title="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes">https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes</a></p><div class='title'><b>480p Signals</b></div><p>Overall, if a game supports 480p (or any progressive scan format), we want to use it. Using OPL, there's a way to force this. GSM, or <b>Graphics Synthesizer Mode Selector</b>, is another unofficial PS2 app that works with OPL. When choosing a game in OPL, you can hit <code>triangle</code> to enter the Game Settings menu. Then enter the GSM Settings menu. For 480p available games, enable GSM and switch the "Mode" to 480p.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Be sure to save the Game Settings! Now, when you launch the game, it will automatically run in 480p.</p><div class='title'><b>OSSC Settings</b></div><p><b>Note:</b> I'm still trying to find the best settings.

| June 20, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the best features of the Playstation 2 on its release was backwards compatibility with Playstation 1 games. In those recent years, no home console had been backwards compatible with its predecessor, mainly because of cartridges. So having a new console being able to play your current game library was a massive boost.</p><p>This was accomplished by including the original Playstation hardware inside of the Playstation 2. Over time, this extra hardware was shrunk, and eventually relegated to software emulation, which wasn't perfect.</p><p>Anyways, with getting OPL and a Games server working for the Playstation 2, I wanted Playstation 1 working in the same way. The overall process for Playstation 1 games is similar to Playstation 2 games, but the steps are different.</p><p>Here is my set up for the Playstation 2 with OPL, the file server, and everything else:<br/><a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">/returning-to-the-playstation-2</a></p><div class='title'><b>POPStarter</b></div><p>Even though the Playstation 2 has the Playstation 1 hardware for games, the games will be run in software. Unfortunately, there's no way around this. <b>POPS</b> is Sony's Playstation 1 emulator that runs on the ps2, and OPL's method of using this is called POPStarter. It stands for Playstation One Portable Station, probably.</p><p><b>Note</b>: There are two ways of setting up Playstation 1 games and POPstarter using OPL and I'm using the old way. This way is only compatible using OPL Anniversary Edition. The latest versions of OPL have removed this method of execution for a newer method which has a slightly better success rate for compatibility. I'm not sure if it works through SMB, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, my Playstation 2 setup is streaming games through the ethernet port using an SMB server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. I need to add POPStarter configuration on my memory card with Free McBoot. And then, there are some additional files required for the file server along with the games.</p><div class='title'><b>POPSTARTER Configuration for the Memory Card</b></div><p>Because I'm running Playstation 1 games from the SMB File Share, I needed to download a specific POPStarter setup for the memory card. I downloaded <b>POPSTARTER.zip</b> found on the following page: <br/><a href="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/">https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/</a></p><p>When unzipped it will give a <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder. This entire folder will be copied to the Free McBoot memory card, but we need to change two things first.</p><p>First, we need to change the <code>IPCONFIG.DAT</code> file. This contains the ip details of the PS2. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PS2-IP-ADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAY</pre></p><p>These details are all found in the Network Settings of OPL. The PS2-IP-ADDRESS is the IP address of the PS2 on the network. The Netmask is the same one in OPL. And the Gateway is the IP address of the File server. All of these are listed in OPL's Network Config menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Note</b>: Originally, my Playstation 2 IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>. POPS does not like it when the IPs of the Playstation 2 and the File Server are on different subnets, so I changed the PS2's IP address in OPL to <code>192.168.2.10</code>. This solved my problem.</p><p>Here is my completed file:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1</pre></p><p>Next, we need to change <code>SMBCONFIG.DAT</code>. This tells popstarter where the files are located on the network. OPL knows where the files are, but it doesn't tell POPS this information when it launches, so we need to add this information here. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PC-IP-ADDRESS PS2SMB<br/>username<br/>password</pre></p><p>There's the server's IP address, the server's folder name, and the login details. I'm using the SMB Share setup on the Raspberry Pi, so here are my details:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.1 share</pre></p><p>There are no login details, so those lines are omitted. The share on the Pi is just <code>share</code>, and it's running on that IP.</p><div class='title'><b>Memory Card Installation</b></div><p>The <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder and all of its contents will be copied to the Memory Card with Free McBoot. To do this, we'll need to put all these files on a simple USB Drive and plug that directly into a USB slot of the PS2.</p><p>After turning on the PS2 with Free McBoot, you'll need to open uLaunchELF, which is a file browser for the Playstation 2. The drive marked <code>mass</code> is your USB drive, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card in the first slot, and <code>mc1</code> is the memory card in the second slot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In <code>mass</code>, select (mark) your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder, hit <code>R1</code> to pull up the menu, and select copy. Navigate to <code>mc0</code> for your Free McBoot card, hit <code>R1</code> again, and select paste. This will copy your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder to the memory card.</p><p>Your memory card setup is complete.</p><div class='title'><b>File Server Files</b></div><p>On the file server, Playstation 1 games are put in the <code>POPS</code> folder, but we need another file for the emulator to work, the emulator itself! The file for the actual emulator is named <code>POPS_IOX.PAK</code>. It's not too difficult to find through a Google search, but this file contains copyrighted information by Sony, so search at your own risk. </p><p>This last file we're going to need is <code>POPSTARTER.ELF</code>. ELF files are applications that run on the Playstation 2, and this is POPStarter application that runs the emulator. When you select a game in OPL, it will open that game with this application.</p><p>With everything set up, now we need some games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>POPStarter and OPL requires Playstation 1 Games in the VCD format and using the same filename format as PS2 games. When you illegally download any Playstation 1 game, it'll most likely be in the bin/cue format. So, you'll need to convert them.</p><p>The best program to do this with is called <b>PFS BatchKit Manager</b>. It can be found on GitHub here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager" title="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager">https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager</a></p><p>PFS BatchKit Manager is a command line program for Windows, so Windows might complain when you try to open it. It should run within your OPL folder on your File server. Conversions are found under the Advanced Menu. Follow this route:</p><p><pre> -> 10. Advanced Menu<br/> -> 1. Conversion<br/> -> 1. Convert .bin to .vcd</pre></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It will search the <code>POPS</code> folder for any bin/cue files, and process them. First, it'll combine all the bin files into a single bin file. Then it will convert to vcd. PFS BatchKit Manager will also rename your files with the Disc ID in the front and with the correct game name from their database.</p><p>I've had the process fail once or twice on large batches of files, so I always convert a few at a time. It can sometimes take a while, too, so I prefer going bit by bit.</p><p>This will complete the process for single disc games. You can open OPL Manager to double check the file names are correct.</p><div class='title'><b>Multi-Disc Games</b></div><p>For games with multiple discs, there is one more step to complete.</p><p>POPStarter doesn't read the PS2's memory card, so it will create a virtual memory card for saving. Memory card files are stored/indexed by Game Id, and this is problem with multi-disc games because each CD has its own Game Id.</p><p>Configuration files must be set up to tell POPStarter you are running a multi-disc game. This will allow memory card sharing among each disc AND it will allow you to swap game discs.</p><p>There's a script you can download called <b>DISCS_POOPER.cmd</b>, also Windows only. Place this script in the same folder with all the discs of a multi-disc game, run the script, and it will create the necessary sub folders and the configuration files needed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can find this by searching around, but I have a copy of it on my GitHub:<br/><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/blob/03bb3180655a99fb3962c2f889c88d85d5d1404f/POPS/DISCS_POOPER.cmd" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/blob/03bb3180655a99fb3962c2f889c88d85d5d1404f/POPS/DISCS_POOPER.cmd">github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/DISCS_POOPER.cmd</a></p><p>Put these folders and games in the <code>POPS</code> folder of your file server, and you're good.</p><div class='title'><b>Multi-Disc Controls</b></div><p>There are button commands used for multi-disc games to simulate opening the disc tray, inserting a different disc, and closing the tray.

| June 19, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lately I have revisited the Playstation 2, my favorite console of all time. I played the PS2 for hours and hours during college, made some amazing friends through playing games, and have amazing memories of those times. So, I wanted to relive those memories as well as return to a time when video games began evolving into something with more complexity, both for story and gameplay.</p><p>I wanted to return to the PS2 in the same way I've come back to other retro consoles thanks to the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket" title="/analogue-pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. I wanted to have a significant library of games that could easily be stored and sifted through digitally, as well as having them look their best on a modern TV. The PS2 is also backwards compatible with Playstation 1 games, so I wanted to be able to play those too. After messing around with things for about a month, I finally have everything set up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The overall set up isn't too complicated, but it has a bunch of parts required for everything to work together. To quickly explain, I'm using a memory card with Free McBoot on an original Playstation 2 slim to run Open PS2 Loader. I have a Raspberry Pi acting a network file server that OPL is connecting to in order to load games. I have a 4tb hard drive connected to the Raspberry Pi where all of the games are stored. And, the PS2 is using component video cables connected to an OSSC to digitize the video and send it to my modern TV.</p><p>All of this was inspired by another one of Tito's YouTube videos: <br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8</a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2</b></div><p>At the center of the entire set up is an actual Playstation 2. None of this entire process modifies the original console whatsoever. Everything extra can be unplugged from the Playstation 2, and it'll be the same as it was 20 years ago.</p><p>My original Playstation 2 Slim is 10,000km away back in the United States, so I bought a Japanese Slim from Yahoo Auctions. For the best possible compatibility, people had recommended the original Slim release, so I bought a SCPH-70000 model. It was really cheap at only 3000yen, and it came with the vertical stand and a few games.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In later revisions of the Playstation Slim, they moved Playstation 1 processing into software rather than hardware. They also removed legacy hard drive support, which isn't even available for the Slim.</p><div class='title'><b>Free McBoot Memory Card</b></div><p>In order for any of this to work, we need access to the Playstation 2's file system and be able to run unofficial applications. In particular, we need to be able to run <b>Open PS2 Loader</b>. Creating your own Free McBoot memory card from complete scratch has a lot of steps, but these days, you can easily buy a pre-built Free McBoot memory card from Amazon. I bought one from Amazon JP for only 1500yen.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Official Playstation 2 memory cards have the Magic Gate branding on them, which acts like a Seal of Approval ensuring that all games are compatible with it. This card doesn't have such approval and it's also 64mb compared to the official 8mb limit. Because of this, some games don't like it. We Love Katamari in particular has some saving problems.</p><p>One really nice thing about this card is that it came with absolutely everything installed on it. It already had OPL, all of the retro game emulators, and other necessary applications.</p><div class='title'><b>MemCard Pro2</b></div><p>Going one step further, 8bitmods released a device called the MemCard Pro2, which they restocked a month or two after my initial setup was complete. It is advertised as the "the last memory card you'll ever need," and with this, I no longer need a dedicated memory card with Free McBoot. Although, having an extra card with Free McBoot is handy when moving files around from Memory Card to Memory Card.</p><p>All of the details for the Memcard Pro2 are discussed in another post: <a href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">/memcard-pro2-for-ps2</a></p><div class='title'><b>Raspberry Pi 3 w/ SMB Share</b></div><p>While the hardware center is the Playstation 2 itself, the software center is the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi acts as a File Server and it is directly connected to the PS2 using an ethernet cable. </p><p>I didn't own a Raspberry Pi, so I went to Yahoo Auctions again to find a cheap one. I found a Raspberry Pi 3 with heatsinks installed and an AC adapter for 4000yen. Good deal!  Later, I bought an acrylic case with a fan for only $4 from AliExpress. Also, I had an extra LCD Monitor and a extra keyboard, so I'm using those with it, too.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In order to set up the SMB Share, you need to flash an SD card with the Playstation SMB Share.

I used a program called balenaEtcher to put this image on one of my extra micro SD cards.</p><p>On the initial power-up, it takes a little time to do some set-up, but eventually you'll be given a log in prompt. This happens every time the Raspberry Pi boots up. The default username is <code>pi</code> and the default password is <code>raspberry</code>. With everything set up, you'll need IP information for OPL's connection. Type in <code>ifconfig</code> and you'll be given the network data.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" /></a></p><p><pre>inet 192.168.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255</pre></p><p>This is the line that we care about. The Pi's IP address is <code>192.168.2.1</code>. To turn off the Raspberry Pi, type <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code>. It will shutdown, but then you'll need to unplug it. There's no actual on/off switch.</p><p><b>Note:</b> the Raspberry Pi doesn't like to plug and play. Anything you have plugged in on start up, it will auto mount, but if you plug in something after it has already been turned on, you need to manually mount the device, whether it's a keyboard, a monitor, or a usb drive. Plug in everything before you give it power for best results.</p><div class='title'><b>USB Drive</b></div><p>The SMB Server expects a USB device plugged in the Raspberry Pi to serve files from, and the device must be formatted exFat. </p><p>Every one recommends to use a USB Flash Drive, but standard USB Flash Drives aren't able to scale. They're fine if you want to have a couple of games, but I want to have a large library of games. Modern USB hard drives are pretty big. In fact, I have a few 5tb SSD drives for backing up files. But these are powered through USB. The Raspberry Pi uses a measly amount of power so it can't power anything through USB.</p><p>I had an older 4tb Western Digital hard drive with an actual hard disk, not a solid state or a flash drive. This drive has its own power connection separate from USB. By plugging this in and turning it on before powering on the Raspberry Pi, it works just like any other USB storage device. </p><div class='title'><b>Games and OPL Manager</b></div><p>The physical chain between the Playstation 2 and the games is complete, but there are two more steps. First off, we need some games. You can illegally download games for several different places online. These files come in two different flavors: ISOs and bin/cue files. </p><p><b>Open PS2 Loader</b> is the UI application used on the Playstation 2 to select and run these files, so they need to be in a particular format and have a particular file naming scheme. The USB Drive also needs to be in a particular file structure for OPL to find the games.</p><p><b>OPL Manager</b> is a PC program that will do all of this for us. You can download it <a href="https://oplmanager.com/site/" title="https://oplmanager.com/site/">here</a> or just search on Google if the location changed.</p><p>When OPL Manager first starts, it will ask for a base location. For me, I use a temp location on my USB drive for a few reasons. (One) OPL Manager can take a while to load if there are a lot of games at the location. So, when using a temp location it only needs to load the few games I'm working with at the time. Likewise, these games take up a LOT of space, so (Two) I don't want to process them locally and copy them later. This takes up a lot of space on my local computer, and takes time copying to the hard drive later. I want to work with everything on the drive, and move files around on the drive after.</p><p>Once a base location is selected, it will create all of the folders OPL requires. PS2 games will primarily go in the <code>DVD</code> folder. The <code>CD</code> folder is also for PS2 games that use CD format rather than DVD. This only matters when a game uses other tracks on the disk for audio. I don't think any PS2 game does this. All notable and modern games have their music baked into the game code, so the <code>CD</code> folder can be ignored.</p><p>There are a few other interesting folders, particular <code>THM</code>, <code>ART</code>, and <code>CFG</code>. For a further description of these folders, please read my full OPL load out post: <a href="/old/v7/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="/opl-theme-and-loadout">/opl-theme-and-loadout</a></p><p>OPL only wants games in the ISO format, so you need to convert CD/Bin games to ISO. OPL Manager can do this. Choose <code>Disc/Convert to ISO</code> under Tools, and select files from there.</p><p>Also, OPL wants a particular file format. OPL Manager will mark all the illegal filenames for you and ask you to change them. File names should start with the game's disc id, should not contain certain invalid characters, and should also not be longer than 31 characters. OPL Manager will help you make sure all of this stuff is correct.</p><p>Once all of the games are converted, I copy them into the main location and they are ready.</p><div class='title'><b>Open PS2 Loader</b></div><p>With the games ready, it's time for the Playstation 2 to find them. The USB Drive is plugged into the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is turned on and the server is running. Now, the Playstation 2 can be turned on. With the Free McBoot memory card also plugged in, Open PS2 Loader, or OPL is available from the menu. Select it, and OPL will open.</p><p>When it first boots up, there will be no games. There's a few things OPL does by default that we'll change later, but the first thing we'll need to do is configure the Network Settings so OPL can find the file server.</p><p>Hit <code>start</code> to bring up OPL settings, go to Network Config, and here is where we will enter the IP information from the Raspberry Pi we received from several steps before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the SMB Server, the PI's IP address was <code>192.168.2.1</code>, and the "Share" folder's name is <code>share</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Originally, my PS2's IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>, but I changed it to <code>192.168.2.10</code> to have the same LAN address as the Raspberry Pi. It's not necessary for OPL to work, but it is necessary for POPS to work with Playstation 1 games. Please read the <a href="/old/v7/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl">POPS</a> post for more details.</p><p>Overall, OPL will serve PS2 games from 3 locations: the USB drive, the hard drive, and the ethernet port. By default, it won't automatically connect to these locations. You need to hit the Circle button to connect manually. Also, the hard drive is selected by default. All of this can be changed in the OPL Setting menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By default, I am displaying the Ethernet games on Start Up. Since we're not using the USB Drive and Hard Drive for games, nor are we using any Applications, I disable all 3 of these options in the menu. And for both Ethernet games and Playstation games, I have OPL connecting to these sources automatically on start up.  Now, when OPL opens all of my Playstation 2 games will be shown immediately.</p><p><b>Note:</b> I'm using OPL Anniversary Edition which has Playstation as a menu display. The latest versions of OPL have removed the Playstation menu and force everything to be run from the Applications menu for better compatibility.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 1 Games</b></div><p>We can also run Playstation 1 games using OPL.

The video game generation of the Playstation 2 was the final generation to output analog video by default. HDMI became the standard for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and now everything is HDMI. Without any additional modification, Component video is the highest quality available for the PS2. I'm using the Retrovision Component cables for the PS2, which are apparently the absolute best.</p><p>Analog video must be converted to digital, and that's where I'm using the OSSC.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The OSSC isn't too difficult to get working, but it can send you down a rabbit hole of optimization headaches.

| June 10, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When searching for new films to use for class, I found <b>Lights Out</b>, a 2016 Horror film by director David Sandberg that stars Teresa Palmer. Films that end up working really well for class aren't necessarily the ones that you'd expect, nor are ones you'd really like on a personal level.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Lights Out is PG-13, which makes the film pretty tame by horror standards. It also makes use of constant jump-scares and startles to accomplish its job of spooking the audience, a device that really undermines the weight of a truly scary moment. Overall, the acting isn't bad, but there are some goofy moments. The script is the same way. On my own, I probably would've skipped to end, halfway though.</p><p>But, many of these problems end up working pretty well in class. The acting is good enough to make each scene believable and understandable for students. The script pushes the story along and there aren't any glaring plot holes or problems. The jump-scares turn the movie into a game for students as they try to make their friends jump at the wrong moments. The PG-13 rating works, too, as I'm not showing gore to students.</p><div class='title'><b>Monster</b></div><p>The film has some unique ideas, too, bringing its monster to life and showing its limitations in a very understandable way.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As we learn later in the film, <b>Diana</b> was a patient in a mental hospital over 30 years ago. She suffered from a rare skin condition which burns her skin when exposed to light. The doctors tried an experimental procedure by blasting light rays at her (good idea), which incinerated her skin and body, reducing her to ash.</p><p>Her spirit still remained within the mind and body of a young girl she possessed at the hospital. Now, Diana only has a physical presence in the dark and shadows. When exposed to light, she disappears. But, she's still there.</p><p>They do some fun things with this. A character turns off the lights in a room and she appears in the shadows confusing the person. She disappears and reappears in sync with a neon sign at night as a character realizes someone is there. Spoilers, but my favorite use of this effect is at the end when police officers try shooting her. The muzzle flash from the gun is enough to make her disappear and the bullet goes right through her.</p><div class='title'><b>Commitment</b></div><p>The closest thing to a theme the film has is the idea of commitment and abandonment.</p><p><b>Rebecca</b> is the main character, played by Teresa Palmer. She is dating, not-dating her boyfriend, not-boyfriend <b>Bret</b>, played by Alexander DiPersia. The film starts with them in her apartment at night. Bret wants to stay for the night and he wants their relationship to move forward, but Rebecca pushes him out. She doesn't even call him her boyfriend.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Bret unfailingly continues to support her. He brings her to the school to meet, <b>Martin</b>, her younger half-brother. And he brings them back to their mother's house.</p><p>Rebecca fights with her mother because she blames her for driving her father away. Her mother fights back because Rebecca ran away after her father left and wouldn't support her. Rebecca also thinks that with the death of Martin's father in the opening of the film, Martin will suffer the same way as she did as a child.</p><p>She takes Martin, and they leave their mother at home, crying. Once again, the mother feels betrayed by Rebecca abandoning her, and Rebecca runs away from the situation.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the apartment, she acts like a mother to Martin. But, Bret calls her out on her behavior. In the moment, she feels betrayed by Bret for not supporting her, and she tells him to leave.</p><div class='title'><b>Performance Test</b></div><p>In my class, up to this point in the film, we've been doing listening exercises. Students get copies of the script with missing words and sentences. While watching the scenes, they try to catch the words, and write them into the script. But, these scenes lead us to performance tests.</p><p>Performance Tests are done in pairs of students. For this first scene, one student is Becca and one student is Bret. These tests aren't just about remembering the lines and saying them. They must express themselves using the feelings of the characters through their words, gestures, eye contact, and movements.</p><p>The scene itself doesn't have any overwhelming gestures and movements expressing their feelings. It's almost all internal. Becca feels that she's doing the right thing by taking Martin away from her mother, and she feels hurt that Bret doesn't support her. Bret is clearly expressing his views on her actions and maybe suggesting that there's a better way.</p><p>"You should leave now," Becca says to end their conversation. Bret leaves as Becca stares straight, not looking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Check the <a href="/courses/lights-out" title="/courses/lights-out">Course Page</a> for grading criteria.</p><div class='title'><b>Next Performance</b></div><p>Over night, Diana comes to Becca's apartment and attacks her. She survives by turning on the lights. The next morning, child services takes Martin back to his mom. Becca calls up Bret, she apologizes, and then they go to Mom's house. They break in and Becca finds the information about Diana's past and who she is. She's attacked again by Diana, but Bret saves her. They both run out of the house, as her mother arrives.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This last scene is a much more energetic acting scene than the one from before. Both Becca and Bret are running from the house, and Becca is distraught and hysterical from her attack. Bret tries to help and understand the situation as he never saw Diana.</p><p>For this scene, both character's feelings and emotions are clearly visible, and students should clearly show them too through their performance. Because of Becca's hysterics, many of her words are fast and often said over Bret's. It's really important for students to act together and support each other to make the overall scene successful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>More later...</b></div><p>More to come</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playstation 2 Game Inventory" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playstation-2-game-inventory">Playstation 2 Game Inventory</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

To keep track of everything, I put all the entries in a database. And because OPL uses box art and metadata, I wanted an easy way to view it all.</p><p>So, I made another Game Inventory page, and this shows all of the Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games currently stored on my hard drive.</p><p><i><b>UPDATE - January 23rd, 2025</b></i>: The PS2 Game Inventory has expanded to include Dreamcast and Gamecube games. Probably more in the future, too.

Zombies are so absolutely boring and over, but I think the TV show highlighted the best parts from the game, which, at the time, I thought was rather derivative. I suppose enough time had passed that these ideas seemed novel again. </p><p>With the completion of the game and the show's first season, we continued with <a href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us-part-2" title="/the-last-of-us-part-2"><b>The Last of Us Part 2</b></a>, which was an absolute beauty of a game. The story focused on the cost, guilt, and obsession of vengeance in beautifully lush and unique environments. In my opinion, Last of Us 2 is Naughty Dog's masterpiece, and it's borderline criminal that you could easily buy the game for $10.</p><p>In Summer, <a href="/old/v7/final-fantasy-xvi" title="/final-fantasy-xvi"><b>Final Fantasy XVI</b></a> was released, which was another incredible unforgettable experience. The Final Fantasy series continues to grow, mature, and innovate itself by pushing the boundaries of what people consider the Final Fantasy series is capable of. The story is long, but you feel the weight of your actions and consequences. There's more DLC and story on the way, too.</p><p>Having experienced some amazing stories, I was looking for another world to immerse myself in. People had been raving about <a href="/old/v7/cyberpunk-2077" title="/cyberpunk-2077"><b>Cyberpunk</b></a> after it had gotten some significant updates with a new expansion and new story. When it first released in 2020, I had played it for a while, but eventually fell off with its repetitiveness. These new updates kept the game interesting, and the photo mode kept me snapping. I eventually fell off again, but these updates made it into the game it was meant to be.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Back with Nintendo, the year was dominated by one of the Switch's best games, Zelda.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-1_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-1_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-1_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_gaming-trends.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_gaming-trends.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_gaming-trends_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_gaming-trends_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_gaming-trends_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/nintendo_card_favorite-game-2.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The Legend of Zelda is one of my favorite game series of all time, along with Pokemon and Final Fantasy. With the release of the Switch, Breath of the Wild was a new take on the series focusing on open world exploration, and solving puzzles using a limited amount of tools. The story was pretty boring, but the overall gameplay and experience completely over shadowed it, so it didn't matter.</p><p><b>Tears of the Kingdom</b> is a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild and completely surpasses it in every way. Dungeons are now more expansive and allow for more natural discovery rather than relying on finger pointing by the game's quest system. Your tools are far more powerful giving you far more creative freedom on how to solve puzzles and complete objectives. Most importantly, the story complements your exploration of the world, and, for the first time, The Legend of Zelda actually makes sense as a title. It was another incredible gaming experience for an amazing year.</p><p>Also, I spent a lot of time playing racing games on the Switch. Having decided to return home in winter for the first time in 4 years, I bought <b>Mario Kart 8</b>. I was sure that my nephew had played this game to death, so I needed some practice to not embarrass myself when he eventually challenges me to race. Later in the year, <b>F-Zero 99</b> was released, the first F-Zero game in nearly 20 years. It was an incredibly fun multiplayer racing game. Ultimately there wasn't a ton of depth to it, so I dropped off.</p><div class='title'><b>Twitch</b></div><p>Whether PlayStation or Switch, I kept streaming throughout the years and talking about all my favorite games as I played them.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-streaming.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-streaming.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-streaming_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-streaming_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-streaming_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-viewer.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-viewer.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-viewer_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-viewer_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2023/twitch-recap-2023-viewer_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Thanks to my community, I was able to talk through a lot of the ideas I had about the games we were playing, and ultimately write a well-thought and complete post.</p><p>More gaming next year. :)</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
