| September 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, my work day was spent using POI HSSF, which can read and write Excel spreadsheets in Java.  You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is Squaresoft's first RPG on the PSP, and it is making history..  It is also the first PSP Title to ever have a massive line outside of Yodobashi Akihabara the day of its release.</p><p>This PSP is limited to a mere 77,777 copies making collectors, fans and video game ethusiasts go nuts.  Most retailers sold them at $100 markup..</p><p>Included in this fantastic pack is Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core, a buster sword Cellphone strap..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0440.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0441.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0441.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0441.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0442.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0442.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0442.webp" /></p><p>.. and the new slim and lite PSP-2000!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0443.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0443.webp" /></p><p>with Final Fantasy VII graphics on the back of it..  looks like I've got number 30,785 out of 77,777.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Slim</b></div><p>I know everyone has already talked about this to death, but I think I'll weigh in a little bit myself..  The new PSP is amazingly light, just like everyone has said.  The buttons have been revamped and feel very very fluid..  The don't feel hard and unresponsive like they do on the original.</p><p>It feels really really good ^_^.</p><p>There's actually a slight difference in the screens..  but only slight.  Tony and I powered up both PSPs and set them up for comparison.  The new PSP's screen is a bit more crisp, whereas the old PSP's screen is somewhat muddy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" /></p><p>The new PSP is quite nice ^_^..</p><div class='title'><b>Gaming in the upcoming week</b></div><p>However, when the hell am I going to find time to start playing games on it?  Currently, I'm in the middle of 2 games: Oblivion and Phoenix Wright 3.  Since starting Oblivion, I haven't touched Phoenix Wright 3, which is making things difficult.  I want to finish up Phoenix Wright 3 and get it out of the way before Halo 3 comes out next week, but I also want to enjoy Phoenix Wright 3..  I find it somewhat annoying that I'm putting so much emotion stock into Halo 3.....</p><p>Phoenix Wright 3 is a bit better than its previous game, but it's just as boring..  I really only want to progress through the game to the full grasp of story and finish off that series.  I think this weekend, I'm really going to have to power through it, and write my peace on it.</p><p>Getting into Oblivion wasn't the greatest idea either...  I figured that I would just play it for a couple hours and then stop cold turkey because of how crappy it is.. but unfortunately, it is actually better than I thought, and I'm having fun with it ^_^.</p><p>On top of these two games, I want to give Final Fantasy VII a go, and have been waiting to play Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.. but maybe they'll have to wait.  There's a slew of other PSPs games I also want to start playing, too.  Check out my PSP shelf..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" /></p><p>Not bad, huh?  All these games were purchased between $10 and $15, too.  See.. I can still be a cheap ass when the opportunity arises.  There's still a couple PSP games out there that need to drop in price..  like Parappa, Crush, and Innocent Life.</p><p>I'm going to stick to my 2-game policy to prevent myself from burning out.  I must beat Phoenix Wright over the weekend to make way for Halo 3 on Tuesday.  I think when I'm waiting in line for Halo 3, i'll probably play a little more Brain Age 2.</p><p>Anyways, feel free to complain about how much I spend on video games in the comment section. ^_^  I'm going back to Oblivion.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-avalon-los-angeles-240606">Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The last I came across of sasha was back when his CD fundacion was released about 2 years ago.  I figured that he must've been up to something since then.</p><p>Well, he's not touring around, but he did release a CD between now and then.  That would be the title of this article, Sasha @ Avalon so on and so forth.  I wasn't that big a fan of fundacion but Airdrawndagger and Involver are two of my favorite CDs, so i'll give it a chance.</p><div class='title'><b>Limited Edition</b></div><p>No Luck, actually.  This CD is limited to a mere 10,000 copies, and when I searched for it on Amazon, Ebay and Half.com, the cheapest discs were going for $100.  I love Sasha, but with his current trend of music, there was no way I was going to put down that amount of cash for a CD.</p><p>Thank god for Google.  I checked to see where I could find this disc for the cheapest.  A couple places had it for $15 and $20.  Really?!  Oh wait, they're out of stock.  I continued to wade through these cheap out of stock copies, when I came across two sites that said they actually had it in stock..  walmart.com and Bull Moose audio.</p><p>No way.. they probably just forgot to update their inventories.  That didn't stop me though..  at $20 with a possibility of being in stock, why not just order it?  The least that could happen would be your order canceled and money returned.  So I went for it..  I ordered one copy from Walmart, and another from Bull Moose.</p><p>Success!  Both of my orders were processed, shipped, and received!</p><div class='title'><b>Presentation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" /></p><p>The packaging is pretty badass..  It comes in slip cases that look a lot replicas of vinyl sleeves.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" /></p><p>Quite a spectacular little collection for being a CD release of a live set.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>Sasha @ Avalon is very much in his fundacion style as of late.  Very progressive compared to his previous styles of Involver and pre-Involver.  Sasha's motive for music is to build upon many different layers of sound, which he's been systematic putting into his style ever since learning Abelton Live and going completely digital.</p><p>I don't get his new style, though.  He builds tons of layers, but all the layers eventually blend into each other, with no defintion of melody or sound.  It all sounds the exact same to me and very stands out what-so-ever.  When I listen to his new style, I completely forget I'm even listening to the music.  Later on, I'll check the playlist and realize I've gone through 5 or 6 songs already..  sigh.</p><p>Avalon is quite similar to this style but does break away into melody and definition in a few spots.  The first disc has a couple tracks that are wonderful..  Unlike all the fundacion tracks, I actually start humming them thinking back to the cd. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't enough of these tracks that make me love this cd as a whole.  These tracks are quite soothing, but don't bring the painting into a full composition.</p><p>Not only that, but he suffers a train wreck in the first track of the second cd.  What the hell is up with that?  The only reason this cd is so expensive is because of its rarity..  This is definitely one to download, rather than purchase.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on each individual track:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Salmon Fried Rice" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/salmon-fried-rice">Salmon Fried Rice</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm quite sure that THAT is too much butter.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0427.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0427.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0427.webp" /></p><p>Let the butter melt for a little while, and slap that super tasty salmon into your pan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0428.webp" /></p><p>For this recipe, you'll have to defile the sanctity of the salmon and tear it to shreds.

Be sure to completely mix and combine both ingredients as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" /></p><p>Then comes the rice.  Plop that on top on begin to fully combine all 3 ingredients now.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0433.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0433.webp" /></p><p>Actually, i suppose I forgot one ingredient: Soy Sauce.  Put a very very tiny bit of the sauce over the top of your concoction.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" /></p><p>Like all previous steps, mix mix mix.  Fully mix together all parts until you get it completely consistent.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0435.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0435.webp" /></p><p>That's it!

The hint of butter.. the hint of soy sauce.. all wrapped around the superb taste of the divine fish.</p><p>This recipe is extremely basic, but the taste of extraordinary..  Of course, it's the salmon that brings this fantastic taste to the table in the first place.  Unfortunately, it is a very basic bi-product of the salmon, so it's difficult to focus this as the center of your dinner.  Some green beans on the side would act as a brilliant compliment to this outstanding meal.</p><p>Give it a try if you have some $50 fish sitting around the house ^_^.</p><p><em>PS: The images might not show up in an RSS reader because I turned off hot-linking from my site.

The Wall consisted of any numbers of cars positioned upright for a car to easily plow right through.  Apparently the world record is going through a 10 car Wall.</p><p>So..  the guy drove and the track once..  waving to the crowd.

The rest of the event featured several different alterations of the circular track with different modes.</p><p>There was the chain race, where two car are chained together and the first group to cross the finish while still attached is the winner.  There was the bump 'n run, which is a tag team race.  One team member drives around the track and then bumps into his teammate at the finish line.  Then that teammate drives around the track and does the same for several laps.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" /></p><p>There was the 360 race, where each car had to spin 360 degrees around the finish lap for the lap to count</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" /></p><p>Then they began to change up the course a little bit, using the the little 'pit' area near the finish line.

A movie that can be engaging, can be captivating, and overall you emotionally invest yourself in from the start.  Whether, you love the characters, love the environment, love the music or any other part of it, you are brought into the world with such force that you tune out everything else.  This movie (or game) becomes part of you.</p><p>With such beauty it brings itself to the absolute climax and you are there riding along side it..  You are there with the characters, with the scene as it unfolds.  and BAM.. it hits you.  That feeling of absolute beauty.  So much beauty fills you.. overflows through you..  so much so, that can't help but shed a tear.</p><p>Pure Happiness ^_^</p><p>That's how I feel every time I watch <b>Princess Mononoke</b>.  That's how I feel when Ashitaka and San return the head to the Dear God, he revives himself, and then falls to his death..  At that split moment, when all the destruction, all the hate, and all the war is whisked away into the air..  The peaceful, raped, and bare land lays still..  until the buds of life begin to grow.  The brown scorched hills begin to breathe green from its soil, as the piano solo starts..</p><p>:sniff:..  it's so beautiful..</p><p>It's hard to hold back your emotions when you realize that life does move on..  With all the sadness, anger, and horror, life will always prevail.</p><p>Oddly enough, wasn't it a decade ago when it first came out in theaters?  :looks it up: .. nope, I'm wrong.  It came out in October 1999 in US theaters.  Heh, that was a good movie date..  I went with both Michelle and Lindsey (co-workers at Toys R Us) to Plymouth Manns theater the day it came out.  However, it did release in Japanese theaters in July of 1997.</p><p>Hopefully, whomever holds the North American rights will release a Blu-ray version of Mononoke in the near future.</p><p>Anyways, aside from <b>Princess Mononoke</b>, there is one other movie that captivates me with so much emotion..  and that is <b>Garden State</b>.  I should really buy myself a copy of that movie.  That's the one with Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  I think there may have been others, but i cannot recall.</p><p>Excellent movies..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rock Band US Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rock-band-us-tour">Rock Band US Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As part of the Rock Band release this holiday season, MTV is rolling trucks around the US promoting the Rock Band atmosphere of the game up on stages.  Rock Band, by the way, is a rhythm game by Harmonix, the creators of Guitar Hero.  Rock Band has 4 "instruments": Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums and Vocals.  Form your own video game Rock Band this christmas season!</p><p>Rock Band seems like it'd be pretty fun in the atmosphere they are presented with this stage and crowds.  You really get to live out your fantasy as a rock legend with your Guitar Hero skills.  However, I don't really see THAT atmosphere transferring to the home what-so-ever.  How is playing with 4 people in the same room with a crowd of a couple people compare against playing by yourself with 3 other friends online?  It can't compare at all.</p><p>Rock Band is a purely social game that can only be played with a dozen people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rock Band Tour hits Milwaukee</b></div><p>Anyways, back on topic..  The Rock Band Tour just kicked off this week, and one of their first destinations was Milwaukee.  These tour dates can be found on Rock Band's website: <a href="http://rockband.com" title="http://rockband.com">http://rockband.com</a>.  The tour dates for Milwaukee are incredibly vague though..</p><p>Thu 9/13 - UW-Milwaukee Campus - TBA<br/>Fri 9/14 - TBA<br/>Sat 9/15 - Best Buy - Location TBA<br/>Sun 9/16 - Best Buy - Location TBA</p><p>O_o..  Way to organize yourself MTV.  With no indication of time or exact place, I decided to make a day of it anyways and got Tony to come with me ^_^.  I called up Jin, a former UW-Platteville student, now UW-Milwaukee student, if he had any more information, and also if he wanted to join us.</p><p>Jin had no idea what I was talking about, "No.. I haven't seen anything around campus advertising it or anything indicating anything at all."  Hmm...</p><p>While at work today, he gave me a phone call to say that he knew someone that had spotted the Rock Band truck on campus, back in the Klotche Center parking lot.  Huzzah!  Information..  It pays to know people all over the place ^_^.   With the location in hand, and the road ahead.. Tony and I left Madison around 4.30p and took off to UW-Milwaukee to check out the Rock Band Tour.</p><div class='title'><b>UW-Milwaukee</b></div><p>Getting to UW-Milwaukee wasn't too bad..  I missed one turn that cost us about 10 minutes, and then finding a parking spot took another 10 minutes.  We got to the Klotzche Center to notice the Rock Band Truck!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" /></p><p>The truck was all locked up though, and the canvas was pulled down..  They were certainly closed, but it seemed ready to open at some point.  I figured they were going to do a night event with fog lamps, lasers..  the whole works!  "Well...  let's go find something to eat and then come back.. maybe they'll be open then."</p><p>Tony and I walked across the Milwaukee campus to find some food.  The whole UW-Milwaukee campus is very cramped together, stuck on 3 main blocks in northern Milwaukee..  like 5 minutes north of downtown Milwaukee.  It has all the college buildings stuck together on a block, and all the residence halls stuck together on a block..  So much college in such a little space, gave me a really weird feeling..  it didn't really feel like an actual University to me.  :shrugs:</p><p>Anyways, after dinner, I gave Jin a call to ask him what he was up to and what his plans were.</p><div class='title'><b>Disappointment</b></div><p>Apparently, the Rock Band thing was going on all day and actually ended around 4 or 5pm..  So we missed it.</p><p>There was so many things wrong with their whole setup in the first place, though.  As Jin pointed out to me, There was absolutely no advertising for this events AT ALL.  It was basically word of mouth which didn't work.  In addition, the Klotzche Center parking was on the far edge of campus behind the building in a parking lot only fit about 20 cars..  as you can see from the photo above.</p><p>Also, according to Jin, all the "roadies" MTV hired to help out with setup and, perhaps, advertising, were mainly hired from madison.  These people got totally trashed the night before hand, and simply stiffed the morning crew.  They didn't even show up, so the few people left had a very rocky morning having the setup everything themselves.</p><p>As these failing factors resulted in poor turnout and an overall failure of the event.  I suppose if they had their act together they probably would have still been open by the time Tony and I arrived.</p><p>Booooooooo.</p><p>Well, i'm sure they'll have far better results when setting up for a Best Buy store..  They'll have paid employees to give a hand..  Plus, as Tony mentioned, Best Buy's will probably have their own Rock Band setup close to launch time, so they'll be plenty of chances to play the game with a crowd nearby and not having to purchase the game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Treasure remaking itself" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/treasure-remaking-itself">Treasure remaking itself</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This third remake will be of <b>Bangai-O</b> originally released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast.</p><div class='title'><b>Guardian Heroes</b></div><p>3 years ago, Treasure remade their classic Guardian Heroes on the Gameboy Advance.  Guardian Heroes was originally released on the Sega Saturn back in 1996.</p><p>Guardian Heroes is considered the benchmark for the beat-em-up genre, featuring a pure blend of leveling, brawling, and balance between all playable characters, much like Golden Axe and Gauntlet.  Something that Guardian Heroes really expanding on move-sets, so it had all the moves of a fighter, but was a 5 or 6 player co-op brawler.</p><p>There really hasn't been any game since then to top the this wonderfully designed arcade style classic.</p><p>In 2004, <b>Advance Guardian Heroes</b> was released with very disappointing results.  I've never played it, nor owned it, but I have seen it around for pretty cheap, so perhaps I'll pick it up at some point.</p><p>The US version of Guardian Heroes fetches a pretty hefty price on ebay these days.  Luckily, I was able to snag a Japanese copy for about $26 while studying abroad. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Gunstar Heroes</b></div><p>Right after Advance Guardian Heroes, Treasure set forth to remake another one of their classics, Gunstar Heroes.  Gunstar Heroes was actually Treasure's first game, right after Masato Maegawa and a bunch of his friends split from Konami.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes is a character shmup.  You play Blue or Red as you blast away hordes upon hordes of enemies that never stop coming.  You just keep killing and killing and killing.  It's great fun ^_^ and is considered one of the best shmups of the sub-genre.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes was made for the Sega Genesis and made full use of the hardware.  It was released along side Sega hardcore Arcade lineup and found an excellent home.</p><p>In Oct of 2005, Treasure released <b>Gunstar Super Heroes</b> for the Gameboy Advance.  This release also saw a disappointed release as the public really had no idea what Gunstar Heroes was.</p><p>Despite the poor sales, It's really an amazing game.  It's Treasure's love letter to Sega fans, using several themes of the Arcade Genesis it was originally released with, like After Burner and a couple other ones I don't quite remember.</p><p>Gunstar Super Heroes is damn awesome, so you should pick up a copy at your local Toys R Us for about $15.  Also, Gunstar Heroes is available of Wii Virtual Console for $8, which is also a damn good buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Bangai-O</b></div><p>So, that brings us to today.  By the end of the year, Treasure will release it's third remake on the DS, entitled <b>Bangai-O Spirits</b>.</p><p>Bangai-O is in a weird genre.  It's a free-roaming shmup, where you explore around the level and reach the boss at the end.  I guess, technically, it would be a side-scrolling shmup, except you fly in all directions whenever you want.  The point of Bangai-O is to make massive explosions with bombs laying around the stage and destroy as much as possible with various chains of explosions.</p><p>It was originally released for the Nintendo 64, but found a home on the Dreamcast as well..  that's the only version that was released in the states.</p><p>ugh..  I'm god awful at this game.  I really couldn't figure out how to play it, and I ended up just getting really frustrated with it..  Some people consider it to be one of Treasure's best games, but I don't really see it.</p><p><em>New Features</em>:  Unlike previous remakes, this Bangai-O Spirits looks like it adds a ton of stuff.  Multiplayer (both Co-op and versus), Map Editor, Full map on the top screen..  this actually sounds pretty badass.</p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>This all comes rather timely, as Microsoft, at their pre-TGS conference, finally officially announced that <b>Ikaruga</b> will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade next year.  Ikaruga is my favorite Treasure title, and I also deem it as Treasure's best game.. hands down.</p><p><a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html" title="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html">http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html</a></p><p>Ikaruga is a beautiful horizontal-scrolling shmup featuring the Zen of fighting light v. dark.  Enemies are of both light and dark, and you are able to combat and absorb their powers by flipping your side, back and forth, between light and dark.</p><p>Stunning game.</p><p><em>Also</em>, along side Ikaruga, <b>Rez</b>, <b>Every Extend Extra</b>, and <b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b> will also be making their way on XBLA.  Nice!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3: Biting the Bullet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the Bullet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I will never own an original Xbox, mainly because all my good Xbox games are now backwards compatible, the controller is rather horrid, and the overall bias the Japanese games are far superior to American games.. definitely on consoles.</p><p>But the 360 has changed a lot of things.  It's a very robust machine that IS changing gaming, and some good games are actually beginning to appear on the console.</p><p>I've been absolutely blown away by Mass Effect, but one cannot ignore Halo 3.</p><div class='title'><b>Rationale</b></div><p>I have decided to buy Halo 3 on launch day, but main rationale behind owning/playing it, is to re-live an old past-time that Justin (my army pal) and I shared nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Back in the day, Justin and I played the living crap out of Goldeneye.  In the morning, we'd have school, and in the evening we'd meet up at our jobs at Toys R Us.  I ran the video game section there, and the manager's usually made him do crap work.</p><p>As the store came to a close, and I hid the last of my re-shop, He and I would get back to his place around 10:30pm, and end up playing versus Goldeneye until 1 or 2am on a school night.  We'd do this damn near every night, and occasionally drag other co-workers along for the ride.</p><p>Our video game days were pretty much over when he decided to join the military..</p><p>Several months ago, he picked up a 360 and have found a new love in video gaming.  He's played the crap out of most of the major releases such as Rainbox 6 Vegas, Ghost Recon, and Bioshock.  He is eagerly anticipating the release of Halo 3, so he pushes it onto me.</p><p>At this point, I was teetoring either way, but what really clenched it for me were these Best Buy midnight parties, with free stuff.  Video game events are badass, so why the hell not.  The rationale outweighs the irrationale.</p><div class='title'><b>Decisions</b></div><p>So, I'm gonna preorder Halo 3, BUT which copy do I buy?  I've got 3 to choose from.  Legendary Edition comes with 4 discs, a bunch of artbooks and a Spartan helmet all for $130...  Absolutely not.  So, really I have 2 choices: Regular Edition or Limited Edition.</p><p>Well, this is a tough decision for me.  I will always think twice, thrice, etc on whether or not to get the slightly more expensive Limited Edition versus the a stale 'ol Regular Edition.  It's collector nature for me.</p><p>My main distinction is that this is Halo.  It has already sold more than one million copies prior to its actual release.  It is going to be the most common, most played Xbox game ever.  This game will basically be worthless several weeks after release.  It's "collector" value with plomit faster than a fat guy into a buffet.</p><p>In a long enough span of time, the Limited Edition will retain more than a $10 lead on the Regular Edition.  The Regular Edition will probably be $20 around this time next year, whereas the Limited Edition will never be printed again.</p><p>BUT, is that really true?  I can still find copies of Halo 2 Limited Edition in used game stores for around $20, whereas the normal edition is $14.  The Limited Edition MAY be limited, but there are still around 500,000 copies of it floating around.  It's no where near rare.</p><p>Obviously, the collector's argument is not valid at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Value</b></div><p>Let's look at this argument from a different perspective.  Regular Edition is $60, and Limited Edition is $70.  You get raped by the inane price no matter which way you face..  So what's the difference between the 2 versions.</p><p>Regular Edition nets you Halo 3.  Limited Edition nets you Halo 3, hardcover Halo 3 artbook, Halo 3 fiction book, extra disc with "making of" features and HD calibration details, and a hardcover case that'll fit everything inside of it.  You get a ton of stuff for that extra $10.  Almost enough stuff to forget you're paying so much for the most common game you'll ever find in a year.</p><p>That's in a year though, and I've got two choices.. so the decision has been made on the Value argument.</p><div class='title'><b>Ironic</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" /></p><p>So yeah, today I picked up the preorder for Halo 3 Limited Edition at my local Best Buy, which will be having its midnight release party in 13 days.</p><p>I find it rather ironic that Halo 3 will be the first Xbox 360 or Xbox game that I'll be purchasing at full price..  Mass Effect will no longer have that honor.  Unless you count those Burger King games, which were bought at the full price of $4 each..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phoenix Wright: Release History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phoenix-wright-release-history">Phoenix Wright: Release History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After the completion of Metroid Prime 3, I've been really getting into Phoenix Wright 3.  I usually play about an hour or two every night, and currently I'm on the second investigation part on the third (out of four) cases.  It's kinda fun, but it certainly does not have the intensity of innovation I experience when I played the first Phoenix Wright.</p><div class='title'><b>Release History</b></div><p>Let's explore the releases of Phoenix Wright to further understand the lineage of the series.</p><p>Phoenix Wright was first released for the Nintendo DS, here in the US on October 12th, 2005; however, the DS versions of Phoenix Wright, or Gyakuten Saiban are actually remakes of the Gameboy Advance games.  Gyakuten Saiban 1 was first released 4 years prior on the same date for the GBA.</p><p><pre>10/12/01 - Gyakuten Saiban - 58,877 units sold</pre></p><p>It's release did not do so well, but that didn't stop Capcom from making a sequel.  Just one year later, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was released.  Of course, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was the exact same game, but with different music, different stories, and some new characters ^_^.  Capcom re-released the first title on the same day at a budget price to increase sales for the series overall.</p><p><pre>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 129,630 units sold<br/>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 - 176,953 units sold</pre></p><p>Which, worked fairly damn well.  All those that missed Phoenix Wright the first time around, easily picked up both titles now that the first one was a mere $30.  Capcom LOVES to make billions of sequels, so it comes to no surprise that they did the exact same thing the year after.</p><p><pre>12/19/03 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 101,388 units sold<br/>01/23/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 - 173,336 units sold</pre></p><p>Actually, after playing PW3, it's rather hard to picture it selling 173k units.  The IP seemed pretty strong.  Sure it wasn't moving a million units, but nearly 200k units is pretty good for Japan sales.</p><p>I'm not really sure what happened at this point..  But Gyakuten Saiban 4 did not follow the next year.  Perhaps something happens at the end of the third game that simply can't allow for a 4th game with Phoenix Wright..  As October came up, they released PW3 at a budget price.</p><p><pre>10/01/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 68,181 units sold</pre></p><p>But, with no new game to push sales of the old game..  it did nearly as well as the series debut.  Fall of 2004 saw a shift in Handheld gaming though..  This was the time where the Nintendo DS was released.  Capcom decided to hop on the DS craze by porting over their slight successful game series.</p><p><pre>09/15/05 - Gyakuten Saiban - 128,842 units sold<br/>10/12/05 - Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - ~100,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The 5th year of Gyakuten Saiban, brought forth the DS version of the game with slightly better graphics and a NEW DS only case after you beat the game.  Original fans of the series flocked to the new level, whereas new adopters of the series fell in love with Phoenix Wright for the first time.</p><p>Over here in the US, the game sold poorly thanks to poor marketing and very few units shipped.  It wasn't until Spring of 2006 rolled around and people had huge difficulty finding the game, that Capcom realized it was their fault for the poor sales.  They re-release the US version a couple times, while over in Japan, they released the game at a budget to pull more people into the series.</p><p><pre>06/15/06 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 149,552 unit sold</pre></p><p>Now, I don't know if the original DS release had this, but this budget release just so happened to include the full English version of the game.  Gamers in the US helped add to these sales since they could not find a US copy.  Sales were also very high due to the release of the DS Lite which happened 2 months prior.</p><p>A couple months later saw the revamp and release of the Second title.</p><p><pre>10/26/06 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 111,485 units sold<br/>01/16/07 - Phoenix Wright 2: Justice for All - 90,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The Japanese release started right off as a budget title, which makes complete sense as it lacked a DS only chapter.  The Japanese release also contained the full English version of the game, which can account for lack-luster US sales.  Die-hard US Phoenix Wright fans simply imported the game to play it months ahead of time.</p><p>Along with the Japanese release, began the promotional support for the long-awaited release of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  A new original game for the series that contained all new characters, and all chapters which used all capabilities of the DS, and in April of 2007..  fans finally got their game.</p><p><pre>04/12/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 4 - 487,000 units sold</pre></p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was hands-down, the fastest selling title of the series.  In fact, in its first week it sold more copies than any single version of a previous game.  Thanks to all these crazy previous releases, fans knew what was coming for the series.  DS chapters much like that extra chapter in the first game.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was such a success, that a few weeks later, Capcom simply blurting out that Gyakuten Saiban 5 would happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, for US fans of the series, Gyakuten Saiban 4 does not contain the English version, so we must wait for the US release, or perhaps it'll be included on its' budget release.</p><p>Anyways, just 2 weeks away, Capcom finally released Gyakuten Saiban 3, and fans of the series who missed it the first time, can finally see how Phoenix Wright's saga ends.</p><p><pre>08/23/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 77,000 (so far)</pre></p><p>Not too far off, Phoenix Wright 3 will be hitting the states.</p><p><pre>10/23/07 - Phoenix Wright 3: Trials and Tribulations</pre></p><p>Capcom is currently holding the 3rd game over the heads of us US fans of the series..  "If you want Phoenix Wright 4, you'll have to buy Phoenix Wright 3.  If sales are good, it's a go!"  Though, they are already planning on bringing it over as <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</em>.</p><p>Honestly, I cannot wait for Apollo Justice..  So much so, that i'll actually play through Phoenix Wright 3 ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Total Sales</b></div><p>So, let's tabulate all the current sales and see how the individual games actually stack up against each other.</p><p><pre>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (5 versions) - ~566,901 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Justice for All (4 versions) - ~479,826 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations (3 versions) - 318,517 japan only, so far<br/>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (1 version) - 487,000 japan only</pre></p><p>I'd imagine sales for Apollo Justice eventually overtaking the original game, no problem.</p><p><b><i>Update:</i></b> By the way, I should really mention that I acquired this data from Cubed3 who found it from the Neo-GAF post I originally saw it in, which happens to be 4 months out of date, and also from vgchartz.com which is almost never accurate.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/69">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/67">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
