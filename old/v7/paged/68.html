| April 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.

The Dreamcast had a very short life which began in November 1998 in Japan, and September 9th, 1999 in America.  In February 2002, NHL 2k2 was the last game released in America..  However, life continues to grow in small reaches thanks its initial purpose and devoted fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallel Arcade Development</b></div><p>The Sega Saturn was really the first instance of Sega developing their home console along-side arcade Hardware.  In 1994, Sega released the Saturn in Japan, alongside their ST-V arcade hardware.  Since the hardware was nearly identical, games arcade games developed for ST-V could be ported near exactly.  Fans could play exact copies of arcade games on their home console.  The other difference was that ST-V arcade units took huge clunky cartridges, while the Saturn took standard CDs.</p><p>The Saturn was initially flawed due to its emphasis on 2D graphics, and last minute 3D graphical additions.  2D games looked amazing, but the populous was captivated by the 3D marvels other consoles and arcade hardware provided.  Sega lost support, but they learned from their mistakes... sort of.</p><p>Sega began development of the Naomi arcade boards, to be far more versatile.  The <b>N</b>ew <b>A</b>rcade <b>O</b>peration <b>M</b>achine <b>I</b>dea was developed with both 2D and 3D in mind.  Boards were set up to process in parallel, so you could just add another board and increase processing power.  (and) Machines were fitted to read from GD-Roms, Sega's proprietary disc format.  GD-Roms were just normal CD-Roms except data was compacted together for optimal storage capacity.  A normal 700mb disc, could hold up to 1.2gb of data.</p><p>This was extremely flexible for the developers..  The could now produce discs to distribute their games, rather than cartridges..  something the console industry had already been doing at this time.</p><p>The Dreamcast is a lone Naomi board, squished into a plastic case, ready for sale to the mass public.  In 1998, Sega released both the Naomi boards and the Dreamcast in Japan.  (and then) The Dreamcast pretty much died in 2002.  Few games released, first party support dropped, and a very healthy alternative: Playstation 2.  However, it was their Naomi boards that continue to spur life on thanks to a healthy underground game genre.</p><div class='title'><b>Shmups</b></div><p>Shmups is an audible abbreviation for Shoot 'em ups, or Shooters.  Such famous shmups include 1941, Defender, Gallaga, Asteroids, Gradius..  Games that involve some sort of airplane or space ship, dodging enemy fire and other obstacles, while shooting up enemies.  Shmups were somewhat mainstream when gameplay and graphics were simply, but began to go underground when mainstream games began to offer more.</p><p>Anyways..  Shmup companies turned to the Naomi boards for their cheap development and production costs, as well as, ease of porting to a home console.  Shmup companies continued to develop Naomi games and subsequently release them on the Dreamcast even after the consoles death.  Since 2003, the Dreamcast has had 9 shmup releases: Shikigami no Shiro 2, Psyvariar 2, Border Down, Chaos Field, Trizeal, Radilgy, Under Defeat, Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica..  as well as some hentai releases.</p><p>These Dreamcast games would not have been possible if not for the Naomi boards and the devoted fans of the Shmup community.  In fact, such after death support began to reach enough demand for Sega to re-release some Dreamcast units in 2006, packaged with Radilgy.</p><p>Most of these after-death titles have been ported to other consoles, and thanks to O3 (Sega's unofficial private US publishing company) some have even come to the states.  Chaos Field was released in America in Feb 2005 on the Gamecube..  Currently, O3 is bringing over Radilgy on Gamecube posed to release at the end of April.  They renamed in Radio Allergy, though</p><div class='title'><b>The Dreamcast lives on..  kinda<br/></b></div><p>Man..  my Dreamcast has seen better days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" /></p><p>One day when I tried playing Crazy Taxi, the disc would scrape along the tray cover.  I took it upon myself to fix this problem..  so I took off the case, tightened some screws, and reassembled it.  Well...  the CD had plenty of room to spin around, but the Dreamcast always thought the tray was open.  When I reassembled it, the tray no longer hit the little lever in the back :/  Nothing a little tape won't fit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" /></p><p>To play import games on my Dreamcast, i need a boot disc.  Something that took about 5 minutes of googling, and another 5 minutes of burning to accomplish.  When completely screwed together, my Dreamcast thinks the tray is either closed or open..  It can't detect open/close functionality..  So i help it along..  no biggie.  Thus my Dreamcast looks like Dreamcastenstien.  It has life..!  I have given it life..!</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Throughout my travels across the earth, across the country, and across the internet, I've found myself in the position of purchasing the 3 most recent Dreamcast games:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" /></p><p>Under Defeat, Karous, and Trigger Heart Exelica, in order of release date..  After the Dreamcast Rerelease in 2006, They began publishing games with DVD style cases rather than CD cases.</p><p>So...  Are these games actually worth it?  well... here's what i think:</p><div class='title'><b>Under Defeat (Limited)</b></div><p>Originally released in early 2006, I found this game from <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a>.  I wasn't really sure if i was seeing it correctly, but they actually had copies of the Limited Edition version which came with the soundtrack.  I had heard Under Defeat was an amazing game, so i decided to order it.  Also, i think someone said the Limited version was super crazy rare, so that was also a deciding factor.</p><p>Under Defeat is developed by G.rev, which was founded by several Taito employees who had developed G Darius.  G.rev's notable works include Border Down, also on Dreamcast after its death.  G.rev is also noted for working with Treasure on their development of Ikaruga and Gradius V, two of the best shooters ever made.</p><p>Under Defeat does not disappoint.  You pilot a German attack helicopter in a modern version of World War II.  The helicopter will rotate right and left when you move allowing you to fire at an angle rather than straight on the whole time.  You get 3 bombs to start off with that launch an air strike upon the ground..</p><p>The little bit of innovation comes into, what they call, an option.  When you hold your fire long enough, a little green bar will fill up in the lower left hand corner.  When it flashes OK, you can begin firing again, and you'll release a little pod which will fire upon your opponents.  You can grab other power-ups that will change its weapon: Vulcan, Cannon and Rocket (from weakest and frequent to strongest and less frequent).</p><p>All kills this little guy acquires will net you double points.. and Therein lies the secret to obtaining massive points: Have the option kill as many high point gainers as possible..  especially laying the final blow on bosses.</p><p>The gameplay is very easy to pick up since it is rather basic..  The sounds and graphics add that extra icing on the cake that makes this game great fun.  The game plays 2D, but the graphics are in full 3D featuring rich textures and distinguishable colors and models to make enemies noticable and prominent.  Bullets are pretty easy to spot too.</p><p>Stylistically, smoke and explosions plays a extra role..  Whenever you fire a bullet a little bit of smoke emits from your cannon.  The Bullet flies through the air and hit your target with a little bit of smoke residue.  When enemies die, there's a little bit of pause as its engulfed in flames and bursts from explosion.  The fiery orange sparks from the enemy but is sharply over powered by black smoke.  The smoke stays in the air, and eventually fades away from the sky..   Sometimes, if you aren't heavily shooting up an enemy it'll blow up a little and fall to the earth underneath emitting a smoke trailed descent.  Another explosion results in the impact, with more smoke.</p><p>Under Defeat is an amazing joy to play, albeit just a little bit difficult.  I would definitely recommend any casual fan of the shooter genre to check out this game.  Much like Border Down, it will most likely stay on the Dreamcast, so if you do find a copy online for around $50, that will probably be the cheapest you'll get it for.</p><p>Buy from import retailers who support these companies by buying their products in the first place.  With out community support, we wouldn't even have these games at all.  In fact, Ncsx still has copies of the LE version in stock: http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/T-46704M.html  .. if you're a fan and you have the money, i'd say it's worth it.  Then you can say, "Yes..  i am responsible for the Dreamcast refusing to die."</p><div class='title'><b>More to come...</b></div><p>I'll get my impression of the Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica up in the next couple of days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takumi" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takumi">Takumi</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 11, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, Madison's newest Japanese Restaurant, Takumi, opened its' doors to the public:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" /></p><p>Takumi is located on the east-side of Madison, right next to the Half-Price books, Noodles and Milios.</p><p>We arrived around 8pm, and walked right on in and were greeted by the waitressing staff, "irashaimase. ^_^"  That really threw me back for a second...  All the other Japanese restaurants I've been in Madison, have been very American in their service; however, none can really be compared to hearing "irashaimase" when you walk in the door.</p><p>Irashaimase is one of the most polite ways of saying, "welcome to our store" in Japanese.  If you enter any retail store in Japan, you'll hear the closest clerk to you say it.  (and) Then it has a domino effect throughout the rest of the employees of the store.  It reminds me of the 6 story 100-en store in Hamanomachi in Nagasaki (which is now closed when i went there over spring break).  If you perch yourself on the 3rd floor near the circling staircase and a new customer walks in, you'll hear, "Irashaimase" start on the 1st floor and trickled up by each of the clerks to the top floor.  It's very surreal.</p><p>Anyways, The place itself was very quaint. The had a bar, a sushi bar, a couple tables, and Tea Rooms towards the back.  We probably should've taken the Tea Room option, but went with the standard table.  We sat down and took a look at the menu.  Takumi primarily focuses on Sushi.  3 or 4 pages of their 8 page menu feature different entrees, combos, and single items.  The also had some hibachi, donburi, and bento.  We all ordered something different: Matt went with the hibachi, Leif and Steph went with a bento, I ordered sushi, and Zach also ordered sushi.</p><p>Takumi also had full Japanese sized beers in the favored Japan Brands: Asahi, Sapporo, and Kirin.</p><p>First, they brought us a sampler of their Ginger Salmon dish...  It was decent tasting, though the ginger was very overpowering.  It tasted like a standard Chinese American dish.  I suppose they were probably testing out their recipes, or something..</p><p>Next, they brought us our soups and salads and then came the main course.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" /></p><p>I've never had better Sushi in my life.  The California Rolls were somewhat standard, but the Sashimi..  my god.  The salmon was full of flavor, full of meat, full of color..  so good.  The tuna was also fantastic, as was miscellaneous fish on the end.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" /></p><p>Leif and Steph's tempura bento was also quite tasty, as was Matt's salmon hibachi.  Takumi can definitely do fish.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Definitely better tasting than Ginza and Edo.</p><p>Though, with 2 beers, the tricolor entree, and a side of fried rice, my bill came out to $37.35..  The Tricolor Entree was about half the bill..  Beers were the other chunk..  Sushi is not without its cost.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sakuracon-seattle-wa">SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, Kyle, Jesse and Myself flew out to Seattle, WA to attend <a href="http://www.sakuracon.org/" title="http://www.sakuracon.org/">Sakura-Con</a>, Seattle's premiere Anime Convention.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>One of the two days i've attending SPAMM this semester, Kyle queries, "say Dyre, Jesse and I were wondering if you'd be interested in flying out to Seattle for Sakura-Con this coming April."  I thought about it for a second, but that was all the time i needed before agreeing to their proposal.  "Hmmm...  that sounds like a great idea, there Kyle.  I'll definitely take a look into costs, planning and the like."</p><p>Going out to Seattle offered more than just an Anime convention.  SPAMM founders Ace and Jess had moved out there when Ace got a job working for Microsoft.  Also, another friend of ours, Hilary, lived in the 5 hour vicinity, too.  Plus, it's fricken Seattle.  I've wanted to go there ever since i graduated High School.  I'm not really sure how that came about..</p><p>Anywho, i got price quotes, hotel reservations, etc all set up.  Did a cost benefit analysis for our options, and everything seemed quite kosher.  Off we went.</p><div class='title'><b>Seattle, WA</b></div><p>I hardly did any research about what we were going to do in our downtime, but the little research i did just blew me away.  I had never actually looked at a map of Seattle, so i hit up google maps and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr"> typed it</a> in.</p><p>My god.  Even from the plain maps, it looked beautiful.  Vast amounts of lakes and rivers, covered the terrain.  This was all realized as our plane headed downward into the area:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07927.webp" /></p><p>Cool Blue Lakes and Rivers, Lush Green Forests, White Tips of distant mountains..  and the Sky-scrapper center.  Seattle is all these things in one.</p><p>Once we landed, got our luggage, and rented a car, we set forth on the open roads.  The terrain was as green as it looked from the sky.  Despite the heavy amount of urbanization, Seattle maintained it's green roadside forests, and beautiful scenery, though the large shipyards took away from the natural scenery.  We drove up Hwy 5 towards downtown, but then took a detour East headed for Redmond.  The suburban areas kept itself grounded to the environment with heavy forests, mixed with houses, restaurants and other businesses.  We attempted to look for Microsoft Headquarters and Nintendo Headquarters, but were unable to trainspot them from the highway, nor the little suburban roundabout before heading back the direction we came.</p><p>Our cheap ass rental car felt like it was about to die, so we decided to get to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A"> hotel</a>, check-in, and then register for the Convention.</p><p>After doing such things, we got something to eat at The Islander in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1"> Pike Market Place</a> area.  It was some of the most delicious shrimp I've ever tasted.  We walked around the Pike Market Place a little more afterwards, and then headed back to the hotel.  Then i slept for 14 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday Afternoon</b></div><p>Saturday, i finally got around to calling everybody and we met up with Hilary for lunch in the International District.  We ate at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A"> Fu-Lin Chinese Restaurant</a>, where the Ramen actually tasted like ramen from the Cafeteria at Nagasaki GaiDai in all of its' bland, rubbery, waxy, noodley, fatty, yet tasty flavor.  In the same area, just happened to be an import toy / video game / model / figure store, entitled <a href="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php" title="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php">Pink Godzilla</a>.  It's interesting to see how much these import stores hike up the prices for the 'demand' in America.</p><p>I did end up purchasing Trigger Heart Exelica on the Dreamcast, though.  There was about a $5 markup compared to the Japanese price, so it wasn't really that big a rip.</p><div class='title'><b>Cultural Divide</b></div><p>Something that rather surprised me was how large the Asian population is in Seattle.  Out here in Madison and up in Minneapolis, you'll catch a couple Asian Americans around.  Perhaps a couple more actual Asians in the South Union area, but the vast majority is Caucasian and African American.  In Seattle, there's a greater balance of the 3.</p><p>Obviously, since we're on the West coast, this is the original landing point for most Asian immigrants.  It's real interesting to see some customs that have transfered over and similarities between Japan in particular.</p><p>From what Ace and Jess told us about the weather, the lowest the temperature ever gets is around 35 to 40, and the highest it has gotten for them was around the 90s.  This weather is nearly identical to Nagasaki, according to what I've experienced and what #five has told me.</p><p>The garbage is far more recycling friendly as well.  In Japan, you separate burnable, non-burnable, bottles and cans when you throw away your trash.  All the public places I've been in around the west just have one single Garbage can that you dump everything into.  However, Seattle has garbage divisions much like Japan, separated by normal trash, paper, cans, and bottles.  Almost every public garbage can i saw had these four divisions.  No wonder the environment looks so damn beautiful.</p><p>Also, Seattle has quite a bit of Sakura and White Plum trees.  I was rather disappointed that i missed out on Sakura trees blossoming in Japan, but Seattle made up for it with its own blossoming beauties.  I'm not sure why i didn't take any pictures.. :/  I suppose the similar weather and immigrants were responsible for the healthy Sakura population around the city.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakura-Con</b></div><p>Anyways, Saturday was the day that we really spent our time at the Con, unless you count the hour and a half spent in line the previous day.

We walked around the dealer's room quite a bit.  Jesse not only got one of his Penny Arcade books signed by either Tycho or Gabe, but nearly defeated one of them in Puzzle Quest.  I also pissed off one of import game dealers commenting on his prices compared to those in Japan.</p><p>The gaming rooms were pretty disappointing.  Microsoft dominated one of the rooms with 360 stuff, while the other rooms had a ton of single player games.  Guilty Gear was the only traditionally fighting game present.  Dead or Alive 4 and, of course, Smash Brothers were the next closest :/  sadness...</p><div class='title'><b>As day turns to Night</b></div><p>All Saturday has been rather cloudy and rainy.  Ace and Jess confirmed that it did rain quite a bit, but never the down pours we experience in the Midwest.  The weather is usually overcast with a misty like rain that doesn't really get you wet..  So, you rarely get good beautiful days (like Friday), but you also rarely get snow, thunderstorms, and other severe weather.</p><p>After much decision making, we decided to go back to the fish Market, and go to Pike's place for dinner, where we had the most delicious meal of the trip.  I had stuffed Smoked Salmon with Spinach, along with several of their brewed beers.  Fantastic..</p><p>Afterwards, Ace and Jess showed us around to some of the attractions, such as the gum wall:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070407_seattle/DSC07951.webp" /></p><p>A wall covered with used pieces of chewing gum.

Jesse was somewhat regretful that we didn't spend enough time at the Convention.  After all, that was our main reason of going to Seattle.  I think my whole time of going to Anime Conventions is coming to an end.  I'm really only interesting in what the dealers are selling, and what games are available in the game room.  This Con really failed at both for me, despite its large size.  The cosplayers were rather fantastic though.</p><p>One reason that <a href="http://nobrandcon.com/" title="http://nobrandcon.com/">No Brand Con</a> trumps all other Anime Conventions i've attended is their phenomenal game room, surprising vendors, and the 'No Mercy' room which plays Bad Anime and J-Drama.  Plus No Brand Con is at such a small scale that you actually meet people and see them throughout the weekend, rather than just once.</p><p>Even though it was just a simple weekend, i'll definitely be back up there for the <a href="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/" title="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/">Penny Arcade Expo</a> at the end of August.  Perhaps this time, i'll find time to actual go out and listen to some music.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - 24 Game Game Wallet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-24-game-game-wallet">DS - 24 Game Game Wallet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I also love getting packages that i completely forgot i ordered..  From the looks of the outside, it looks like a DVD or some PS2 game..  I noticed that the from address has a little ebay logo next to it.  I don't remember ordering anything off ebay in at least a month or two.  Oh what could it be..?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" /></p><p>Oh sweet.  It's that DS case i ordered when someone mentioned it in <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937">this thread</a> on Cheap Ass Gamer.</p><p>I had been looking for a DS game case that could hold a large amount of DS carts for a while now.  When i first started buying DS games, i needed something to hold them in..  I mean, you can't carry around the game boxes because they're too bulky, and you can't carry the cartridge itself for fear of damage.  I first ran across <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do" title="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do"><br/>these cases</a> at Best Buy and they worked great when i owned 6 or 7 games, but when my game library grew, i needed more room.</p><p>I looked far and wide, but could not find anything as compact and portable as those 3 game shells.  I came across something similar on the internet, which held 6 games instead of 3, but i could not find anywhere to purchase such game case.  When i first got to Japan, it was easy to find <a href="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html" title="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html">this great case</a>.  This case is AS compact as the 3 game case and also comes in different colors and the game snaps into the case, rather than float around with the 3 game case.</p><p>This still hadn't solved my problem though.  My DS library had gotten up to the 20 range, and 3 little 3-game cases and a 6-er wasn't going to hold all my games.</p><p>When i saw this 24 game case on CAG, it only took a little googling to find <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">their website</a> and <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012">their product</a>.  Only 10 whole $.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" /></p><p>This case is pretty slick.  It's a stylish little case that's smalled than a DVD case with a tiny penguin in the corner, offered in two different accented colors.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" /></p><p>Inside are 4 pages which hold 6 games each.  Each page is slick plastic vinyl that couldn't possibly damage the game cart.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" /></p><p>It certainly looked like this Penguin case would solve my problem of tooo many little cases and consolidate the bulk of my little collection in one easy to carry around case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" /></p><p>The DS games slide in sideways, making the case viewable in a landscape view.  The pages are quite sleak and clean that the game slides right in without and resistance and damage to the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" /></p><p>5 minutes later, i stuffed most of my games into the case.  My collection has gone beyond 24 games, so there's not much you can do there.  My 6 game case can still hold the games i'm using most often, since it's quite portable.  Those crappy Kanji games can sit in that 3 game case for all i care.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  That huge mess of games has been consolidated down in one shiny penguin white and grey pack.  Just as easy to transport as my DS and my 6 pack.</p><p>I'd say that anyone with a decent amount of DS games, should definitely own one of these things.  It's rather appauling the most popular gaming system of 2006, and potentially of all-time, has dick for portable game storage to complement it's portable play.  It took independent game accessory maker, <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">Penguin United</a> to solve this annoying problem finally.</p><p>After looking through their site a little more, i think i'll probably order this <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011">Wii-mote Charger Stand</a> next, since one of my Wii-motes has ran out of batteries, and i don't plan on buying new batteries each time this happens.</p><p>Wheee<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to McFarlane Lost Toys" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mcfarlane-lost-toys">McFarlane Lost Toys</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 29, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>i was browsing 4chan today and came across several threads about tonight's episode of LOST.  One the posts was some comment about how they brought back all the characters that have died into all the flashbacks, but the photo for the post was a figure of Artz.  It looked like any 'ol crappy action figure, but it was still a LOST figure.  How awesome would it be to get a Jack figure and have him yelling at the Locke figure for a couple seasons or two..  Kickass awesome, that's how awesome.</p><p>I hopped on google and typed in 'lost figures' and what i found was far more than i bargained for.  Apparently McFarlane Toys picked up the rights for LOST figures.  Collecting McFarlane Toys had been one of my favorite hobbies back in high school and art college..  allow me to elaborate:</p><div class='title'><b>Back in the day...</b></div><p>I think i've always been a collector at heart.  I started off on baseball cards and garbage pal kids cards, like most kids growing up in the 80s.  I didn't really have a ton of money, so cards were really the perfect fit.  I could easily spare $1 or 2 after school to hit my local Ben Franklin (now turned into John's Variety and Pets).  Collecting cards really began the whole aspiration to completing something.  Acquiring an entire set of a specific item of this world.  Striving for completion.  Finishing what you started, and searching wide and far to accomplish your goal.  etc, etc, etc.</p><p>With collecting anything, you began to acquire a lot of excess that you don't really care about.  You usually become caught in the moment that you gloss over the fact that most things are a waste of money.  Oh well.. I'm American and this is how our country works.</p><p>Anyways, in high school i began working at Toys R Us, and lemme tell you.  Giving a kid an income at store that sells things intended for short-term entertainment value will start eating away at said income, unless they have a strong will, very good tastes, sensibility towards money or simply realize that toys are really a huge waste of money that companies make a huge premium because they are cheap pieces of crap.  Thankfully, at the time, i was in the mindset that toys are cheap pieces of crap.</p><p>However, that changed when i ran across my first glimpse of McFarlane figures.</p><div class='title'><b>Todd's Toys / McFarlane Toys</b></div><p>We had a few aisles of action figures at Toys R Us: mostly 7c and 8c though.  Most action figures are cheap pieces of crap.  They were army figures that stood straight and stoic, horribly painted, and solid colored accessories.  They were wrestling figures that all had the same body, slightly changed outfits by color or paint jobs only, and faces that looked nothing like the actual wrestler.  They were movie figures that also looked nothing like the actual actor, had no consistency of size between different movie franchises, and usually came with so many extra accessories that were never actually featured in the movie.</p><p>In a neatly straighten, plastic garden sea of mediocrity, McFarlane toys blew everything out of the water.  The first figures i laid eyes on were Spawn series 6 and 7.  These figures looked beautiful.  Faces actually had discernible features, clothing actually looked soft and flowing like real clothing, the color used represented earth tones normally found in actual human clothing.  It looked like someone ACTUALLY spent time and care making these figures, rather than just pumping out something for kids to buy.</p><p>The beauty of the figures were only matched by the medium.  You had Alien Spawn with a dark dimly painted body, wrapped in tentacles.  The Freak had actual hair, a famished physique, and baggy pants.  Each figure in this set looked drastically different than the next.  Each figure had a different posture, different build, different color, different head.</p><p>I fell in love ^_^</p><p>As new series came out, each figure became darker looking, darker colored, and more dramatic poses.  When the Spawn movie was released in the theaters, i caught the 'making of' special on the Sci Fi channel.  Todd talked about the movie, and in the last segment he talked about the figures.  During this time, he went through the process of creating his figures, and his vision of what his figures should be.</p><p>He said that he would tell his assistants that once they finished painting a figure and they think they had it just right, throw it on the ground.  "Kick it around in the dust and dirt and completely soil your paint job...  Then it'll look exactly how i want it."  He want on to explain, "These figures are representative of some happy love story environment..  These are characters in a dark, dirty world with corruption, sleaze, and villainy.  They should not only look the part, but feel it."  This is the love that goes into McFarlane Toys.</p><div class='title'><b>Coming of Age..</b></div><p>Todd really loves his toys.  He brought his comic book (Spawn) to life within his figures, and made them in his own vision.  In 1997 and 1998, He began to branch out and do this with other properties as well.  He branched to video games with his Metal Gear Solid figures, movies with Austin Powers and his Movie Maniacs series, and into music with The Beatles Yellow Submarine and Kiss.  He began making figures of his favorite franchises in the way he wanted them to look.</p><p>This move was business genius.  His figures know grabbed the attention of a much wider audience and was able to boost sales considerably.  Though, i like to think he was still making figures for himself.  This next move was proof of that.</p><p>In the year 2000, his figures branched into another one of his favorite hobbies: Baseball and other sports.  After buying Mark Mcguire's final homerun baseball of that season, he released his Baseball, Hockey and Football figures.  Again, he began making the figures he wanted, while making yet another genius business move.  Sales climbed exponentially, as he continued to release more figures.  I mean, who the hell wouldn't want a beautifully action posed 6 inch figure of their favorite sports star.</p><p>This was about the time i quit Toys R Us, i moved out of state to Wisconsin when i wanted a new start at college, rather than finishing art school.  Since i was no longer in direct contact with McFarlane figures, and didn't have that first contact with a new shipment of figures, I began to loose touch.  I checked spawn.com every now and then, but i really didn't have a community of spawn figure collectors to talk with or gain knowledge from..  so touch was lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Collecting the figures.</b></div><p>When it came to actually buying figures, a figure had to meet 1 of 2 criteria: rare or awesome.  I usually picked up the rare figure in each new series unless i just didn't like it, but whenever i came across a figure that looked awesome, i picked up that one as well, despite rarity...  hell, that's the reason you buy action figures in the first place.</p><p>McFarlane figures were always distributed to be collected.  Most figure series had 6 figures and came in a case of 12, which generally contained 2 or 3 of each common figure, and then one figure of the series intentionally distributed to be rare.  There will always be one figure that comes 1 per case, and usually it's the most scantly clad female figure of the group, or the most kickass figure of the group.</p><p>To further the collectability scheme, each series generally had 'first edition' figures.  These were figures first off the production line.  They were inspected and sometimes changed slightly, to fix errors or just improve upon.  Then the actual production of the figures commenced.  At Toys R Us we usually got a case or two of these first edition figures.  Months after the line had been in the market, McFarlane would go back and repaint this series in all new colors, and then release them again.  Generally, any given series of McFarlane figures had at least 3 separate versions of a single figure.</p><p>First editions usually don't go for too much more than regular editions.  Some of the time they are seriously flawed, which is why they were changed.  This is especially the case with one of my favorite figures: Manga Spawn from Spawn series 10.  Manga Spawn has a chain that goes from one hip bone to the other.  The first editions had a plastic chain, with huge chain links.  It looked gawd awful.  The regular version featured a metallic chain like a necklace, with tiny links and a gold shimmer.</p><p>The rare figures are always worth more, and can sometimes be next to impossible to find for an older series.  When McFarlane got the rights to the Matrix Reloaded/Revolution toys.  Each case of 20 figures, contained only one of 2 twins.  Prices for these figures immediately shut up to $35 each, and continued to climb.  They are pretty cheap these days, though.  $20 each on ebay, right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Through the dormant years</b></div><p>These past years, i've rarely glanced at spawn.com to see what has come out.  Honestly, my primary collecting efforts have turned to video games.  But whenever i find myself at a Toys R Us, i make sure to check out their figures.  Toys R Us has the best assortment of McFarlane Toys, and if you visit one less traveled, you can usually find the rare figures easily.</p><p>I have 4 personal favorites that i've collected over the years, in order of release: <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802">Manga Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793">Mandarin Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138">Wings of Redemption Spawn</a>, and <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519">Gunslinger Spawn</a>.  I would gladly take photos, if i actually had them here with me, but they are at home, displayed on my other shelves.</p><p>One of my favorite figures he has made that i do not own is <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844">Armchair Morpheus</a> from Matrix figure series 2.  Though, it looks pretty cheap on ebay. Also, i missed out on <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658">Mandarin Spawn 2</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>Anyways, Back to Today, McFarlane has the rights to produce figures of LOST and they look amazing.  Series 1 of the LOST figures came out November 2006, and feature Charlie, Locke, Jack, Kate, Shannon, and Hurley as regular figures, plus the deluxe boxset of the Hatch.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318</a></p><p>Like all McFarlane figures, they look simply amazing.  Of course, these photos are of the original sculpture by Todd McFarlane, and are then used to create the mold.  The final figures are based off this mold, so the most dynamic curves will smooth out a tad, and the paint job will be just a little more efficient too.</p><p>Out of series 1, the Locke figure is striking, but i think the best figure is definitely Charlie.  I would actually open that one in put it on my desk, window sill, or shelf.  I might open up the Locke figure, depending on how it actually looks.  They actually come in boxes, so the can be resealed rather easily without damaging the packaging.  huzzah.  I bet Shannon's figure is the rare one of the set.  Though, they should've made a figure of her getting shot.  I think that would've been more meaningful.</p><p>Upon further inspection, series 2 of LOST figures are released in July 2007.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346</a></p><p>Jin's figure is pretty awesome, but overall rather bland.  The other figures are the same..  What's up with the Sun figure, though?  Is that really the most representative pose for her from LOST?  hmmm..  i suppose that was the episode where she was finally able to be free from Jin's suppression.</p><p>ahh... sweet sweet consumerism.  hmm.  After all this reminiscing i forgot all about those crappy LOST figures.</p><p><b>Edit:</b> Whooo.. i picked up The Hatch Playset at Toys R Us yesterday.  It was clearanced down to $15, so i could not say No.  I was rather surprised that $15 was the same price as the individual figures though.  Quite Pricey.  They were completely sold out of the Locke figure, had plenty of Charlie figures, and equal amounts of the other figures.  It would seem rarity is based on popularity this time, unless Locke is the intentionally rare figure of the set.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - Contact" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-contact">DS - Contact</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Contact was released by Atlus in the states around the middle of september last year.  Sadly, I missed this release by a couple days when my plane left for planet japan.  I picked it up about a week before my next trip to japan, so I would have plenty of time to devote to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Contact follows the mis-adventure of the professor.  The professor ship had been shot by another spaceship knocking his energy crystals to the earth.  As he crashes to earth his path is crossed with our main character, Terry.  The professor plucks Terry from his daily life and pulls him into the conflict.  Now Terry will help reclaim these crystals as you guide him!</p><div class='title'><b>Art Style</b></div><p>What initially drew me to Contact was the art style.  The world of contact uses vibrant colors in fairly realistically concepted environments.  As a contrast, the world of the professor is a 16 bit throw back.  In essence Terry lives in the graphical age of today's sprite world; whereas, is stuck back on super nintendo.  When playing Contact, the professor's 16 bit world is always on top commenting on Terry's action while you guide Terry in the real world below.</p><div class='title'><b>Oh Comedy</b></div><p>The professor may seem stuck in the past, but he's pretty up on the internet.  The game manual is page after page of his live journal entries.  The real comedy gold are the references in his comments, though they do become quite short and repetitive.  Occasionally when you kill something easy, he'll say 'weaksauce.'  When you traverse the military compound, he'll make an 'all your base' reference.</p><p>The comedy is undoubtedly Contact's greatest appeal.  The story itself hasn't gone anywhere in the 5 hours i've played.  It seems to just fuel the game and push it along.  I mean, all you do is go around finding these crystals.  Then again, I had spent some time just leveling and killing townspeople.</p><div class='title'><b>Leveling</b></div><p>Anywho, Contact follows a very MMO style leveling system, as each individual skill is leveled and trained, rather than a set amount of experience.  You have all the normal rpg skills such as strength, stamina, wisdom, and defense, but weapon and magic skills are individual.  You have separate levels for swords, hand-to-hand, and blunt objects; likewise, earth, water, wind and fire elements are separate.  Leveling is pretty easy though..  You just need to use 'em.</p><p>There are other skills to level such as cooking and lock picking.  These skills are specific to the clothes that you wear, which replaces traditional style armor.  Each set of clothes have separate attributes, such as increased evade, increased strength.. But also associated abilities, like cooking and lock picking.  Clothes aren't usually found in chests or markets, though.  They generally require some sort of unlocked event or difficult optional battle.</p><p>Weapons and Clothes aren't the only stat increases.  Replacing a traditional accessory system, Contact has decals.  There are some key 'itemed' key decals, which are different, but you may equip 4 regular decals on Terry.  In the field you'll come across these decals as a '? Decal'.  In your menu, you use the stylus to peal off the decal to reveal it's true identity.  The usual ones i've run across have been stuff like Battle decal or Defense decal.  The stats they boost are drawn at random, so you can really buff up your character.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As for actual gameplay, Contact, once again, acts like an MMO.  You freely walk around, as do mobs.  Some mobs will attack you, while others will leave you alone or even run away.  Terry has a peace mode and a war mode.  While in war mode, you can point at which monsters Terry should vanquish.  You can also kill any npc you want, friend or foe.  One time I walked into a town.  The first guy said, 'hi. Welcome to our town.'  then I laid him to rest with my blade.</p><p>This is another whole aspect of Contact.  Terry can have a good alignment or an evil alignment depending on your decisions, much like Fable.  Killing baddies nets you brownie points, while the opposite does the opposite.  Luckily the game forgives one infraction each time.  It won't deduct negative alignment if your last kill was positive..  You have to do it twice in a row for that to happen.  Same with the other way..  It kinda works like tennis scoring.</p><p>Anyways, Terry also can come across spells and techniques to make life easier.  These use up EP (or whatever it's called) which is collected as you kill things.  Terry starts off with 5 max EP.  Most moves use up 1 or 2.</p><p>Running around killing monsters is pretty boring though.  You walk up to something, go into war mode, and let Terry attack away.  You can pull up the menu at any time and heal him though.  HOWEVER, this introduces another aspect.  You have a ba-zillion different things you can feed Terry to heal him, but some things will take longer to digest.  You can't feed a full stomach, so don't feed terry a bunch of 30HP hamburgers that'll take 5 minutes to get rid of.</p><p>Anywho, killing mobs may be monotanous, but at least boss battles feature some interactivity.  The first boss is some rock monster that throw punches and boulders at you..  Both of which are pretty easy to dodge.  Unlike regular enemies and if you time it right, you can defeat a boss without taking a hit.  Huzzah..</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>Despite it's comedic appeal and depth of gameplay, it does get rather tedious.  Having 20 different adds a bit of depth to the game, but you have to spend some time leveling up all the stats.  It probably wouldn't be so bad, if the gameplay offered more than just going into killing mode to fight.  Some more action style moves would've broken this up..  9aybe they thought they added too much complexity already..  I haven't even touched the cooking part of the game.</p><p>At the moment I cannot definitely recommend this game one way or the other.  I'd need to spend more time to see where the story actually goes..  Though given, the current situations, you probably eventually fight the opposing forces and save the day and the comedy probably won't go any further than the comments the professor makes.</p><p>It's kind of a little gaming gem, but overall, you won't miss it.  Oh well....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Amperos" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/amperos">Amperos</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Fucking Amperos.. yet another late night venture ruined by insecurity</p><p>Amperos is an 8 story all-girls dormatory which lies at the bottom of the mountain that Gaidai sits atop of. Gaidai being short for Nagasaki Gaigokokugo Daigaku, which is japanese for Nagasaki Foreign Language University. Through some sorrid twist of fate, they put the girls dormatory right next to the school, but the guys dorm is a mile or two away.</p><p>One year, some guy started harassing some girls and tried to break in through the front. I mean, come on.. who wouldn't right? So, they erected a 7 foot fence circling the perimeter to keep the old perverts out of there.</p><p>That wasn't enough for another old guy, since he just went over the fence and then was free to harass. Steps had to be taken.. They lined their 1 foot thick concrete fences with 2 inter-weaving lines of barbed wire. But only along the landlocked portion of the perimeter.</p><p>Since Amperos is near the bottom of the mountain, its' north side hugs the road the continues up the mountain to gaidai. This has been easy to climb up and jump over before. The south face over looks the mountain as it continues down into a ravine. The drop is about 5 or 6 stories into the runoff river below. So, they must've figured that no one would get in that way.</p><p>This was still an invitation for some guys, who have tried to scale that muddy rock wall to reach the fence and climb right on in. I don't know if they put barbed wire along the south wall yet.</p><p>I think all this over security just breeds challenge for those uninvited. Its not possible to ever be 100% secure. The illusion of all this safety really just puts a big spotlight on yourself.</p><p>Anyways, needless to say, they are pretty strict about the 'girls only' rule. Each person entering the building is greeted by an orderly who stands watch during the hours when Amperos is open. Girls must return to Amperos by 10p or 11p depending on the night or else they are locked out for the evening. I guess they can't pay someone to be at the post 24 hours.</p><p>This whole thing really screws them over when they want to go out for the night to a bar and drink until whenever they've had enough. More over, it screws up a guys night when he wants his friends to join him at beardo. Much like last night.. Of course, the night probably would've been fine if i still had a room at the guy's dorm :/.. oh well</p><p>This is how last night ended.. Hoping a bus back downtown to five's place, getting some sleep and watching Fugitive 2 on the movie channel.</p><p>Overall yesterday was quite fun. I met up with mennat, natalie, miho and tina for dinner. 3 of which live in Amperos.</p><p>I ran into a couple random friends, too. A chinese guy from the forms and a chinese girl from the dance club. Both pretty surprised to see me. My chinese pal's first words to me, after asking why i was here was, "wahh, you're fat".. thank you.. at least someone said what had been on my mind for the past couple weeks. "Americans like to eat a lot of meat," he said, "its so cheap." I love non-westerner simplistic honesty..</p><p>"yeah.. that and i hardly get any exercise, eat fast-food a little too often, and have been developing a fatty recipe for about two months," i replied. Hmm... well there are 3 easy things i can change about my current lifestyle right off the bat.</p><p>Maybe i'll also try utilizing Madison's metro system as an excuse to use my legs for a change. Then again, i'll probably get back and just say fuck it. Its earie how easy it is to be lazy in America. If fast food was healthier, in general, the whole population would start to become just a little bit healthier, in general. It sucks, because all the healthy food in America either tastes bad, takes preparation, or too expensive. Blah blah blah..</p><p>Yesterday also marked plenty of video game shopping. Almost too much, actually..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Back to Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/back-to-japan">Back to Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
