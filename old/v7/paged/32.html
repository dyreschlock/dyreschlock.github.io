| June 15, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I finally received my very own set of Minecraft Legos, as well as a couple of stickers.  I think this is the first Lego product I've bought (or received) in the last 20 years.  Some might think the idea of Lego Minecraft is ironic.  Others might say this serves absolutely no purpose.  Some might say this was only a matter of time.  And others might say it's art imitating art.</p><p>Minecraft is a computer game developed by swedish person Markus Persson, where you can destroy any piece of the environment, pick that piece up, and place it where ever you want.  Many people describe this game as Legos in of itself, as you move around pieces, and build whatever you want.  That's the mining part of Minecraft.</p><p>The other part of Minecraft is the crafting.  You can take these pieces that you've mined and created new objects, and build more elaborate structures beyond what the environment has given you to begin with.  And you can do whatever you want.</p><p>Many people describe Minecraft is "playing with Legos." In fact, you could argue that Minecraft is the truest most best Lego video game ever created.  Lego has put its stamp on countless other games and all that them fail at the basic concept of what Lego is 'built' on...</p><p>So it IS deeply ironic that this concept has come full circle into the physical realm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Development</b></div><p>This set of Legos has been in development since November last year.  As you might have noticed above, the brand Lego Cuusoo is thrown around a little bit.  Cuusoo is an online development program where Lego creators bring their ideas to a vote.</p><p>Here's the original Cuusoo entry for Minecraft : <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038" title="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038">http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038</a></p><p>All Cuusoo ideas are submitted and put to a vote.  If the idea gets 10,000 supporters, it goes into a development phase where the creators must prove their idea.  Once they've come up with a physical build of the Lego product, it's put in front of a panel of judges, and they vote on whether or not the product actually comes to market.</p><p>Legos are WAAYYYY more serious these days then they were when I was a kid.  I mean, at heart, they are still a kid's toy, and they plenty of sets for children.  But they have advanced sets for the people who grew up with the toy, and enjoy the simple aesthetic.  And even beyond that, this Cuusoo system is there for the people who enjoy building something out of nothing: The architect.  These days the toy goes beyond an age range, and delves into the intellectual range.</p><p>It's awesome that there's this creative outlet for all Lego architects out there, but I've almost always been more interested in the building aspect of Legos.  I liked deviating from the instructions when I was a kid, but I never had the resources to build something from nothing.  These days you can visit any of the Legoland locations and buy any specific Lego piece you need.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Building</b></div><p>Building this thing was pretty fun.  I followed the instructions, and built everything 'correctly'.  Minecraft has always been about digging under the surface and finding all the hidden treasures.  Through building a scene of your own, you are doing the exact opposite.  You are placing all the hidden ore, and items in the environment and covering them up.  It's almost like you're acting like the scenery generator in the game itself.</p><p>There are gold blocks and diamond blocks that are very obviously placed, but there are other elements placed within the scene that are completely obscured when viewing the finished product.  In the end, the builder is the only one that knows they're there.  It's a secret.</p><p>There's also a Lego Steve, and a Lego Creeper available in the set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess it's kind of dumb.  Despite Legos' timeless and ageless construction, I feel like I've grown out of them.  I loved them as a kid, but the aesthetic just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  I get that the limited construction of the tool has pushed the creativity of its users well beyond what it was originally intended for, and built its own community, Cuusoo, based on that, but...  I just feel like I'm passed them.  I don't enjoy the aesthetic anymore.  It's too distinctive.</p><p>Once the Lego structure is built...  then what?  It just sits on display.</p><p>But... I do appreciate this Lego set.  <b>I find it as art imitating art.</b> There are clear choices made in its construction that imitate the game exactly.  A 1x1x2 block of Lego is equivalent to a block in Minecraft, and that is consistent throughout the entire model.  You can't really mine any of the pieces, but its construction and existence mirrors the game.</p><p>It's very well done, and representative of the game.  Much like the feeling of building a home, or any structure in Minecraft channels the fun you had with Legos as a kid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway...  I like it.  I feel like the abstract nature of Lego is a perfect physical representation of Minecraft.</p><div class='title'><b>Update : June 18th</b></div><p>As you may have noticed from one of the photos above, I had enough Legos to make an extra head for Steve.  I did not have enough pieces left over to make a body, though, so I saw this as a sign to complete one of those quirky life goals on my bucket list: <b>Go to Legoland to purchase a single Lego piece.</b></p><p>I was in Chicago this weekend, and the suburbs of Chicago have two Lego stores right next to each other.  There's the Lego Store in Woodfield Mall, and the Lego Discovery Center just outside.  Each store has a thing called 'Pick a Brick' where they have bins of multiple colors and sizes of Legos bricks, and you can fill up a bucket with all the pieces you want.  It's generally $10 for 10lbs (if I recall), and the selection is limited for each store.</p><p>The Lego Discovery Center has the exact sized block I needed, but only in Bright Orange.  I went inside the Woodfield Mall, and they didn't have any bricks of that size at all.  BUT!  The trip was still a success.  I was able to purchase my 1x1 brick and create a friend for Steve to play with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Invisible Monsters Remix" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/invisible-monsters-remix">Invisible Monsters Remix</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 13, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Monday, Chuck Palahniuk released his newest book Invisible Monsters Remix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp"  /></p><p>This is an enhanced re-release of his third published novel originally released in 1999.  Despite being his third published, it was actually the first full novel Palahniuk had ever written.  He originally shopped it around to publishers, but they didn't like the characters, and thought the story was over the top.  He wrote Fight Club as a response to their rejections, and it became his first published novel.</p><p>After Fight Club and Survivor, Palahniuk had a successful track record with his publisher, and they gave the go ahead for Invisible Monsters.  It had been years since he had written the book, and he felt disingenuous releasing a full-fledged hardcover edition, so it was only ever released in paperback form. It was his only book to not have a hardcover edition.</p><p>Fans have been requesting and petitioning Chuck for a hardcover version of the book, and this week they finally got it.  And it has a lot more, too.  The original book has 27 chapters of linear story, while Remix has 42 chapters of non-linear story.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp"  /></p><p>Chuck wanted to book to have the feeling of a magazine.  Most magazines break up their articles with the first couple of paragraphs in the front of the book, and dump the rest of the text near the back.  You can start the book anywhere you want.  And if you like what you're reading, continue to the next linear chapter, otherwise just continue to the next numerical chapter.</p><p>After skimming through the book, I noticed that the original Chapter 1 of Invisible Monsters is Chapter 41 in the Remix version, and the final chapter, 27, is now Chapter 21.  The image above is from the end of Chapter 41 in remix.  Even though, Chapter 1 has a nice start of its own, you'd be missing a single chapter in the whole story if you start there.</p><p>Also some chapters have mirrored text for some reason.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp"  /></p><p>In typical geek fashion, I ordered my copy through St. Helens Bookstore, which is Palahniuk's favorite local bookstore.  Leading up to the release of any of his books, he'll sign all copies pre-ordered through that venue.  These are the same types of signatures you can find in the books when he tours around the country promoting them.  But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he only toured to 4 cities, all on the west coast, so these signed books might be more scarce than his others.</p><p>Also, scattered throughout the book is random party glitter, some red stamped kisses, and "postcards from hell" promos for his newest novel, Damned, released last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp"  /></p><p>I look forward to reading this one again.  Especially since I barely remember anything that happened in the book.  His first five novels all seem to follow a predictable formula.  There's always 3 major characters: the narrator, the friend, and the love interest.  There tends to be more character than that, but there's always these 3.  All 3 of them tend to suffer from some kind of mental or physical illness, and eventually one of them dies.</p><p>All 5 of his original novels have them same tone as well.  It's very dark, and gritty, and nihilistic with amazing detail into mundane activities.  Calculative, efficient, and professional, but with a distance from reality and society.  That's what really drew me to Palahniuk in the first place.  His writing style is so visceral and atmospheric that I can lose myself in his story, and place myself in the character.</p><p>Over the years, he's tried to do things a bit different and break away from the molds he created.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I think Rant and Pygmy captured some of his original magic, but some of his other novels have fallen flat with me.  Snuff and Tell-All in particular were ones that I could not relate to at all.

| June 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Each year, all the high profile gaming companies get together in Los Angeles, and showcase all of their upcoming tech and games for the next year, and beyond.  This is E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, and for gamers, it's one of the most exciting times of the year.</p><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from E3 this year.  I was excited, but really had no idea what they were going to show, or what surprises might await.  For some us, the anticipation and excitement of being surprised is just like Christmas.</p><p>Gaming really hasn't been all spectical and fun for the last year.  Every month, another couple of game studios go bankrupt and shut down.  Every month, the larger AAA games being released are more homogeneous.  And the games that were once interesting and fresh, end up being canceled or compromised by the mainstream.  It really feels like the games industry is dying, and grasping on to whatever sales are left.</p><p>All the press conferences of E3 felt like it mirrored that sentiment.  They showed off many sequels, and "announced" many games that we had already seen, and knew were in the pipeline.</p><p>But there were a couple games I'm looking forward to.  All is not lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Watch Dogs</b></div><p>Out of all 5 press conferences, this was the only surprise.  A new game that wasn't leaked ahead of time, and a completely new IP as well.  After showing boring title, after boring title, Ubisoft ended with a vague introduction of how digitally interconnected our society is, and how easily it can be exploited.</p><p>This went into a gameplay video where your character can make use of the digital world to get around hurdles in the physical world.  You can listen to phone conversations, disrupt power, and view personal information about any random person walking around.</p><p>This character eventually gets into a confrontation, and engages in a fire fight.  Even though you have these digital powers, you still need a gun to fight. :(  Then he takes off in a car and drives away.</p><p>Watch Dogs is open world too, and from the content, it seems like you're connected to the mob or some other organization.  So, if you boil all the elements down, it's basically Grand Theft Auto, but with internet powers.  BUT!  It takes place in Chicago!  Plus, it looks really really pretty.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA">Youtube Link</a></p><div class='title'><b>Beyond</b></div><p>Sony began it's conference by showing off Quantic Dream's newest game, Beyond.  Studio lead David Cage took the stage and introduced Beyond's main character, Jodie, played by Ellen Page.  They played a cutscene from the game that displayed the range of emotions and tones that you could expect from the game, and finished off with a sizzle clip of some action sequences.</p><p>I like Quantic Dream quite a bit, even though both Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain had their problems.  I like the idea of interactive story, and being able to change the story based on what I've done.  Both those game have that, but missed a note here or there that broke the suspension of disbelief.  Overall, if you let yourself be immersed into it's direction, and atmosphere it becomes an amazing immersive experience.</p><p>Beyond looks like it continues the story driven gameplay that Heavy Rain set out to do.  People who've played it on the show floor, have said that it is much more interactive than Heavy Rain too.  I'm definitely looking forward to this one.</p><div class='title'><b>The Last of Us</b></div><p>Sony ended it's conference with its other big big title.  The Last of Us is post apocalyptic, and takes place in the crumbling city of Pittsburg Pennslyvania.  You play as Joel, and have your 14 year old daughter, Ellie in tow.  It's a third person survival action game, as you search for food, water, and other supplies while avoiding confrontations, and survival any hostile encounters.</p><p>They showed off a live demo of Joel and Ellie making their way through an apartment building and running into a group of hostile men.  It turns into a fire fight, but you only have so many bullets, and have to make use of the environment, and anything around you to survive.  The confrontation goes back and forth between fists and guns.</p><p>Ellie and Joel react and make comments to the situation, as things happen, which is a mainstay of any Naughty Dog title these days.  Uncharted was so entertaining and engaging because of all the banter between Nathan Drake and his pals.  One previewer said that Ellie acted with complete shock when you, as Joel, lit a moltave cocktail and ignited a random dude, and another guy said that didn't even happen in his demo.</p><p>And Ellie interacts in the fights as well.  If you're in trouble during a fight, she might run up a stab the guy in the back, or throw a brick at someone about to shoot you.  The combat has a lot of variety, and she seems to react with just as much variety, too.</p><p>The environments look gorgeous, and all of their previous games have followed through with an engaging and interesting story.  I'm looking forward to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Castlevania Lords of Shadows : Mirrors of Fate</b></div><p>The first game Nintendo showed off during its 3DS conference was Castlevania.  It's been nearly 4 years since we've a side scrolling portable Castlevania game on the Nintendo platform.  It's been so long that I guess I'm excited no matter how the game actually turns out.</p><p>It's a 2.5D game where you play as multiple character in their rebooted universe.  The style reminds me a lot of the PSP game Castlevania Dracule X Chronicles.  But they really isn't any word if it'll be as open world as the Igarashi games were.  I hope it's open world, but a level based Castlevania with branching paths sounds pretty fun too.</p><p>Castlevania is fun, so I'd probably buy this if I had a 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>New Super Mario Bros. 2</b></div><p>New Super Mario 2 looks pretty fun, too, even though it is just more Mario.  This game is all about coins, and trying to collect 1 million coins throughout the course of the game.  They don't really explain why, though, and the whole concept is rather goofy.  100 coins still give you a 1-up, so you'll be drowning in lives as your progress in the game.  I doubt the difficulty will warrant that many 1-ups.  Plus, isn't Wario supposed to be the money-grubbing character?  Why does Mario need all this capital?</p><p>They announced this game along side New Super Mario Bros. U for the Wii U, which is a completely separate game.  I'm not really sure what their gameplan is when they saturate the market with two nearly identical games.</p><p>I dunno...  I liked New Super Mario on the DS, but didn't like New Super Mario on the Wii, so I think that I'll enjoy this new one for the 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Games</b></div><p>I'll probably buy those 5 games in the future, but there were a couple other games that seemed like they might be fun, but I wouldn't really want to own them.</p><p>The new <b>Tomb Raider</b> looks like it's taking a page out of Uncharted's book, except with worse dialogue and horrible acting.  The whole Uncharted series was based on Tomb Raider, so it feels somewhat odd that originator is now the follower, but whatever.  I'd like to play it.</p><p><b>Assassin's Creed 3</b> looks kinda fun too.  The whole series is about going back in time viewing key moments in history, and now the setting is the American Revolution is the foundation of our country.  I'm interested to see how that fits into something I know a little bit more about rather than Italy, and the other settings.  Also, the ship-based combat looks really pretty, and I love running around in snowy environments.</p><p>The new <b>Need for Speed</b> looks a lot like Burnout Paradise, one of my favorite racing games.  Criterion is behind both games, and as long as it controls more like Burnout Paradise and less like Need for Speed, I think I'll be playing this game quite a bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Huge Disappointments</b></div><p>There was good to be found, amongst all the negativity.  But there were two particular moments of E3 that were absolutely disappointing for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 3</b></div><p>I like Dead Space 1 quite a bit.  It had a wonderful immersive atmosphere that made full use of sound to convey emotion.  There were some points where the environment was so loud, you couldn't hear anything else, and there were points of silence where you begged for something to make a sound.  I was completely immersed through and through, and felt like I was there.</p><p>Dead Space 2 began tearing away at that immersion.  Sound wasn't used as heavily, as it relied on scare tactics and some particularly grotesque and horrorific moments to make up for it.  Ultimately, the whole experience felt cheap.  Dead Space 2 was now a horror action game.  You were no longer immersed in exploration.  Plus, they added a multiplayer mode to the game?  The fuck?</p><p>The Dead Space 3 demo shown during the EA conference makes it seem like they don't even know what made Dead Space unique in the first place.  It's completely co-op, and cover-based now you're fighting other humans.  Your weapons no longer rotate or have secondary fires, and you combine them into new weapons?  No more unique ammo either?  They're basically phoning this one in.</p><p>During the demo sequence Isaac and Harry(?) are fighting a drill that has gone hay-wire, and the whole time Harry is freaking out and screaming, "Oh my god", "Shit", "Fuck".  Does this time even know what terror is?  Having a character forcing his emotions on you is not compelling or immersive, it's fucking annoying.  I would probably try to kill him during the fight just to shut him up.</p><div class='title'><b>Wii U</b></div><p>I came into the conference pretty excited for the Wii U.  My Wii has got quite a bit of use over the last 6 months with Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade, and Rhythm Heaven.  Plus, there's The Last Story coming out in a few months, too.  I wanted to know that these games will look great on the new console, and when it'll come out, and how much it'll cost.  Plus, I wanted to know what games I might want to play on it.</p><p>They showed off the finished version of the console, along with a proper Pro controller perfect for playing games without any gimmicks.  They showed off a whole lot of boring games, along with some Wii U version of games already released for PS3 and 360.  They showed off <b>Pikmin 3</b> which looks fun but not a lot different than Pikmin 2.  And that's it.</p><p>They didn't give a price.  They didn't give a date.  They didn't announce any compelling game experience.   They didn't say anything worthwhile at all.  Why should I buy the Wii U?  They gave me no reason at all.  And that's especially disappointing because before this week, I was excited.  I didn't really need a whole lot of convincing.  I only needed a really great game, and I probably would've bought one.  But Pikmin 3 is not that game, and there's NOTHING else that looks interesting at all.  NOTHING.</p><p>Gamers are supposed to be excited for a new console, and there's nothing compelling or interesting.  Plus, the lineup doesn't have anything from EA or Activision.  The largest 3rd parties have no presence on this console.  So, the only games we'll ever really play on this thing are going to be from Nintendo?  It's going to be the Wii all over again.  It's a complementary console, rather than your main console.</p><p>What a waste...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So, anyways.  The Playstation 3 looks pretty good in the next year.  And the 3DS is starting to build a decent library.  There's plenty of other games that were shown off on the floor for these two platforms that look great such as Sound Shapes, and Unfinished Swan.  Other interesting games have been announced for the USA such as Tokyo Jungle, Code of Princess, and First of the North Star 2.  There's also Bioshock Infinite, and Ni no Kuni coming out too!</p><p>E3 was pretty disappointing but there's lots of random stuff to look forward to.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM T-Shirt 2012" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-tshirts">SPAMM T-Shirt 2012</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The theme, as always, was to incorporate the annually elected mascot into the design somehow.  The 2012 mascot were two cats from some anime I've never heard of, or care about.</p><p>This is the first design I've done since 2006, so take a look!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/cats2.webp" /></p><p>I think this really incorporates the current state of SPAMM and anime as a whole.  Unfortunately, no one is current SPAMM voted for it, so it did not make it on a t-shirt.  We could make our own, though.</p><p>Also, the design technically isn't finished because it doesn't have a logo, or a title.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>While in college, I was a member and president of the anime club known as SPAMM.  In 2003, we began making yearly t-shirts of our yearly mascot, and for the first 4 years I drew the design for each t-shirt.  Then I graduated, and the club went on without me.</p><p>There's a somewhat growing reverence towards the newer generation of SPAMM kids, and how they have terrible taste in anime, and how they don't give a shit about alumni members, and blah blah blah.  It's all very "get off my lawn" for the most part.</p><p>But anyway, here are my previous SPAMM t-shirt design going back in time.</p><p>For the sake of timeline continuity, it's important to note that SPAMM elections for officers and the mascot are in May.  Then that mascot covers the following school year.</p><p>Also, my drawing style changed a little bit over the years.  I began experimenting with heavier lines, and more ink to show more definition for parts of the subject that weren't showing up well.  This really made things pop and stand up, especially for a simple two tone image.  It began looking a little bit like a black and white comic book.</p><p>I developed this style through these yearly designs, and that's basically where I'm at now.  I don't draw very often, though.</p><div class='title'><b>2006-2007 Year of Mina</b></div><p>I graduated in December 2006, and that final semester was spent in Japan, so I wasn't really even around at all.  This design was really the last creative contribution I had with SPAMM with our movie "completely" wrapped up.</p><p>Mina was our character this year.  She is from the opening sequence of Densha Otoko, a J-Drama about an otaku, anime geek, who stood up for a "hot" girl on a train, he gets her number, and then details everything on the internet while asking for advice from like-minded otaku.</p><p>She only appears in the opening, which pays homage to Daicon IV, an animation produced by a group of nerds in college who would later create and found Gainax, and make Evangelion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/mina_final5.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2005-2006 Year of Katamari</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy was released in late 2004 in the states, and it was hugely popular amongst the members of SPAMM.  It easily won the vote of mascot for the fully school term.</p><p>For this drawing, I tried to incorporate tons of objects relating to anime, or Japan, or Platteville, or SPAMM in general.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/katamari_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2004-2005 Year of Guvava</b></div><p>On the schedule and showing throughout the entire 2003-2004 school year was <b>Macross 7</b>.  An anime that follows the war between the humans and the protoculture.  It was discovered that the protoculture (or whatever) could be defeated by music, so the band, Fire Bomber, flies around in mechs in space, and defeats the enemy by playing their music over and over again.</p><p>Guvuva is the little furry creature that hangs around the girl character.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/guvava_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>2003-2004 Year of Domo-kun</b></div><p>This was the first year we did t-shirts.  Up to this point, I don't think we even had elections for the SPAMM mascot, or entity.  If we did, we never did anything with it.</p><p>After Jason won the election for SPAMM president, he wanted to make t-shirts, so we had a vote for an entity on the t-shirt.  Domo-kun won.  Then I offered to make the t-shirt, or they asked me to make the design.  I was the publicity officer, who was in charge of advertisement, so the basically fell on my role.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/spamm/tshirts/domo_final.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Printing</b></div><p>For all these t-shirts, we just used the local screen printing shop in town.  We pre-sold t-shirts for $10 (or was it $5?), then brought all of our stuff there.  I really don't remember how much it cost, or how many we needed to sell to break even.  The treasurer was in charge of all that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kirishima National Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park">Kirishima National Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These pictures of mine were original taken on <b>May 16th, 2010</b> when Dave and I want on a vacation to Kyushu, Japan.  We visited our friend Brett in Kagoshima, my friend Ikuko in Nagasaki, and we stopped off at Kumamoto, Shimabara, and Fukuoka.  On our second day in Kagoshima, we took a train northeast to Kirishima National Park.</p><p>Kirishima National Park is a volcanic mountain range with hiking trails that go up and down most of the mountains and volcanoes in the area.  From Kirishima's train station we hopped in a cab that took us Ebino-kogen.  The cab driver asked what we planned on doing in Kirishima, and I relayed my ambitious plan on hiking all 5 major mountains in the mountain range.  He replied with disbelief and caution from what I could tell.  As he brought Dave and I to our destination, he gave us his business card in case we were stuck somewhere and needed a ride.</p><p>He also gave us a engilsh map of the entire park which looks a lot like <a href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park">this</a>.  That way we wouldn't get lost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" /></p><p>Above is the map posted on the side of the road up the hill from Ebino-kogen.  We were on the red dot just a little east of Ebino-kogen.  My plan for Dave and I was to hike up Karakuni, and continue on over Shishiko-dake, Shinmoe-dake, Naka-dake, and Takachiho-mine.  And then catch a bus to a train station on the east or west side of Takachiho.  It was about 10am, I think, so I figured we had plenty of time to scale all 5 mountains/volcanoes.</p><p>We started along the hiking trail that lead up Karakuni-dake.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the opposite direction was a pile of rock and ash.

The clouds completely covered the area, which just looked like a dense fog.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7411.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7411.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7411.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7415.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7415.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7415.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7422.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7422.webp" /></p><p>After an hour, or an hour and a half of pushing ourselves up the mountain we reached the peak, which was 1700 meters above sea level.  Though, our accomplishment didn't feel all that spectacular thanks to the cloud cover.  The clouds choked most of the visibility out of the area, so even though there were cliffs that went straight down a couple hundred meters, all we could see was a gray/white mist.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7425.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7425.webp" /></p><p>Onward!  Man, I felt ready to tackle the next mountain on our list.  Though, before even leaving the peak of Karakuni-dake we had to go past a couple signs that said it was a bad idea.  The sign said, "Climbing Mt. Shinmoe is forbidden due to volcanic activity," along with a picture of a volcano erupting.  Whatever... that's just a suggestion.</p><p>We continued along the path, but this path was a lot less stable than the one we climbed up.  Much of the path had been washed away by landslides.  The rock and foot holds weren't stable, so I slipped quite a bit as I tried to press on.  Dave kept trying to convince me that this wasn't a good idea, and after slipping one too many times I finally agreed that we should turn around and go back.</p><p>This is probably what the cab driver was trying to warn us about.  And since I wasn't listening to his cautions, he probably gave us his phone number so wherever we ended up we could still get back to the train station.  That was nice of him. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7445.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7445.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7435.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7435.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, that's about how close we got to Shinmoe-dake.  Just a reminder that the date was May 16th, 2010.  You might remember that this volcano actually erupted in Janurary 2011.  And it didn't just erupt a little bit, it fucking exploded!  Here's the link Dave sent me a day or two after it happened from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/31/shinmoedake-erupts-l.html" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/31/shinmoedake-erupts-l.html">Boing Boing</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/boingboing3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/boingboing3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/boingboing3.webp" /></p><p>In the above photo from the Boing Boing link, you can clearly see the peak of Karakuni directly underneath the massive ash cloud.  Dave and I were there just 7 months prior. :D</p><p>So, it was pretty stupid of me to want to continue along the path and climb the actually active Shinmoe-dake, even after Dave continued to assure me that it was a bad idea.  We turned around and headed back up Karakuni-dake and reached the peak once again.  We made it back just as the clouds removed themselves and we were able to see everything!  We could clearly see into the crator of Karakuni-dake and it's ashy lake.  We could clearly see Shinmoe-dake as well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7515.webp" /></p><p>Going back to the map, we noticed that Karakuni had 3 separate trails that climbed up to the peak.  There was the path we used to get up to the peak.  There was the one we tried to climb down, but were unable to traverse due to rock slides.  And the other path lead down to Oonami-ike.  So we headed that way.</p><p>From the get-go, the path was far far nicer to travel than the step rocky path we began the day with.  Stairs!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7517_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7517_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7517_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7517_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7517_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7539.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7539.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7540.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7540.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7560.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7560.webp" /></p><p>The stairs lead down the mountain into a flat area that had a couple picnic tables, and more trails that spanned the plains.  Traveling down a mountain is so much nicer than going up.  I think it took us about 30 minutes to get down to the crossroads before we set on the next trail that lead up the dormant volcano surrounding lake Oonami.  I think it took us another 15 minutes traveling along the Oonami trail before we caught our first glimpse of the volcanic lake.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" /></p><p>It was quite gorgeous, and scenic.  As we circled the crator, Karakuni-dake started showing up in our view.  That mountain towered over us even though we were still standing on the top of another mountain.  It's crazy to think that we even climbed up the far.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7579_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7579_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7579_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7579_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7579_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7590.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7590.webp" /></p><p>We had a pretty good view of Shinmoe-dake as well.</p><p>We had quite a bit of fun taking pictures, and taking in the whole scenery that the time went by incredibly fast.  Looking back at <a href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park">this map</a>, we were on the other side of Oonami-ike and it was almost 2pm, or maybe it was 1:30pm.  I had a bus schedule on me that I must've picked up from the train station, that said the last bus heading out from Ebino-kogen was 3pm.  Back to the map, it would take us about an hour and a half for us to make it there.  </p><p>We had no time to spare anymore, and had to start bookin' it back to the bus stop.  Of course, we could've just taken a cab back to the train station, but we would rather pay the $3 rather than the $25 it was earlier in the day.  And I figured it might be a bit difficult to call our cab driver and explain the situation since my Japanese is not good.  So, we made some fast tracks to the bus stop.  Hiking is much more intense when you're running across the terrain at running speeds.</p><p>Trying to run, and climb over stuff like this is crazy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" /></p><p>The closer we got, the more of the terrain began to level off.  And as the trail ended we were able to keep a decent jogging pace on the paved road as we neared the bus stop.  I believe we made it there with 5 minutes to spare!</p><p>The journey back to Kagoshima was relaxing and enjoyable.  A reward for a fantastic day of climbing dormant and active volcanoes.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shpongle the Masquerade @ The Majestic" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shpongle-the-masquerade-the-majestic">Shpongle the Masquerade @ The Majestic</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 11, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I just got back The Majestic and it was another fantastic time put on by Simon Posford, otherwise known as Shpongle.  This is the third time I've see him DJing some fantastic tracks from his back catalogue, and every time he always pulls out something amazing of his I hadn't heard before.</p><div class='title'><b>DJ sets</b></div><p>The first time I saw Simon performing a DJ set was almost exactly two years ago in Minneapolis.  He was at the Epic event center, formerly The Quest.  His 4th album, Ineffible Mysteries in Shpongleland, was just released and his set consisted mostly of those tracks, along with Shpongle's entire catalogue.  I finally heard some of my favorite songs live, and the "new" song I heard that night was "I am a Freak".  </p><p>"I am a Freak" is by Younger Brother which is Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan.  Younger Brother is also part of Simon's record label, Twisted.  And Benji Vaughan also performs as a solo artist, Prometheus, also on the Twisted record label.  That night, Simon also performed a couple songs from Hallucinogen in Dub.  Hallucinogen is Simon's psytrance persona, and Hallucinogen in Dub consists of psydub remixes by Ott, also on the Twisted label.</p><p>After that night, despite playing all of my favorite Shpongle tracks, I realized his DJ sets were more of a showcase for his label with an emphasis on Shpongle.  Which isn't a bad thing at all.  This gives him PLENTY of content to work with and build a unique performance every time.</p><p>Last year, Simon went on a full fledged US tour with his stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  He played a fantastic set of original songs, remixes, and plenty of other songs on the Twisted label.  That night he played another spiffy Younger Brother song I hadn't heard before: the Cicada remix of "All I Want".</p><p>And tonight, it was another unique Shpongle experience.  His set was full of remixed Shpongle tracks, and he only played a few original versions of the songs.  His encore was freakin' incredible.  He played some fantastic psytrance beats layered with an Irish tone.  It was amazing how well those two sounds complemented each other.  I was off the ground, and hopping around to that tune.  Fantastic!</p><p>Simon was in a group called Celtic Cross back in the day, so maybe he pulled a song from the single album they produced.  His encore felt live an overall medly of Shpongle tracks though, so maybe he just mixed or mashed something in at the end.</p><p>Also, the audience was restricted from any audio recordings during tonight's performance.  It could be that Simon was road testing some new material for his upcoming 5th Shpongle Album.  I definitely heard plenty of Shpongle-like tracks tonight that I hadn't heard before, and didn't sound like remixes either.  I'm definitely looking forward to that new album.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage Presence</b></div><p>Another unique thing about each Shpongle performance has been the stage presence.  In Minneapolis, Simon toured with the dance troup Archedream for Humankind, which performed unique dances tailored to each Shpongle track performed by Simon.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_7265.webp" /></p><p>Last year, the Sphongletron absolutely blew my mind.  It just looked like a dumb weird looking setup when we first walked into The Majestic, but the Shpongle head attached to the front came to life when it was fully illuminated.  The projected face on the stage setup moved, twisted, and contorted along with the music.  It was so bright and lifelike that it actually looked like it was moving on stage.  You can see this in some video I took <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg">here</a>.</p><p>The Sphongletron experience was definitely my favorite time seeing Shpongle. :D</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" /></p><p>Tonight, Simon was back with a new contraption known as The Masquerade, I guess.  It was much larger, and had much more canvas for the projector to paint onto, but it was nowhere near as amazing as the Shpongle head on the Sphongletron.  The Masquerade had only visuals moving about the white canvas, rather than the canvas actually moving and contorting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120510_shpongle/IMG_0874.webp" /></p><p>It was still an amazing time, though.  All 3 of these performances were unique and amazing.</p><div class='title'><b>Shpongle in America</b></div><p>It's pretty great that he's roaming around the US quite a bit these days.  I first came across Shpongle just after he released Tales of the Inexpressible, his 2nd album, in 2001 and really wanted to see him live.  But he never toured.  At least, not in the US.  He'd do shows in Europe, and Australia, but never in the US.  And now he's been through the midwest each May for the past 2 years.</p><p>AND his DJ performances have improved quite a bit over the last 2 years.  In 2010, it just seemed like he was playing track after track without a whole lot of transition between them.  Last year, he's been stitching the tracks together much more fluidly.  And this year, it was all a choreographed set.  The underlying tone flowed throughout his entire performance, and each track got its spotlight.  He's improved quite a bit!</p><p>Definitely check Shpongle out if he comes to your town. :D<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sakamichi no Apollon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sakamichi-no-apollon">Sakamichi no Apollon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After college, I really haven't watched much Anime, but what initially caught my eye was the return of Shinichiro Watanabe and Yokko Kano teaming up again.</p><p>The two of them have been responsible for such Anime as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.  Not my favorites, but are very solid, enjoyable and landmark series in their own right.  Both those series make a high importance of music which completely sets the tone for the series as a whole.  And Apollon certainly follows suit.</p><p>Sakamichi no Apollon centers on Jazz.  And it's use of music is much more tangible and important to the story.  For Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo is was simply background and tone, but for Sakamichi no Apollon it's what brings all the characters together.  Performing the music is what bring these characters out of their shells and into life.</p><p>Also, Sakamichi no Apollon is completely different genre of Anime than the other two.  It's a serialized slice-of-life drama, not a comedic episodic action adventure.  It's down to earth, and focuses on the actual characters, rather than action or whatever.</p><p>And I like it quite a bit. :D  It's been quite a while since I've actually been into a new Anime.  So long so that I don't even remember the last one I really liked.</p><p>Anywho, there are 2 things that I find interesting about the show beyond just the characters and that's the setting and the time period.</p><div class='title'><b>The Time Period</b></div><p>I didn't really notice this at all until the most recent episode, the 4th episode.  Apollon does not take place in modern day.  There have been plenty of subtle hints throughout the show.  No one uses a cellphone, and all the cars are vintage.</p><p>But I didn't start fully questioning it until the group of characters play their first gig, and a drunken American member of the audience makes such racist statements about the music they're playing.  Not racist against the Japanese, but racist against black people.  Not to say that racism doesn't exist today, but the tone and particular outburst did not feel of this time.</p><p>So, I looked it up, and yes indeed, Sakamichi no Apollon takes place in the year 1966.</p><p>This might explain why so many casual people are into Jazz.  I figured it was just some stupid Anime plot device that everyone knew about Jazz, and they were interested in it.  But, I'm starting to think that Jazz definitely had its market around that time.</p><p>Also, this explains why the main character was looking to buy classical and jazz records in the first episode, rather than a CD or just buying it online.  Though, I chalked that one up to best Jazz songs and albums are probably only available on their original format, vinyl.</p><div class='title'><b>The Location</b></div><p>One thing that really caught my attention in the first episode was that this story takes place in Kyushu.  Kyushu is the south western island of Japan, and is where I studied abroad, many of my friends studied abroad, and many of my friends live.  I'd like to know wherein Kyushu Sakamichi no Apollon takes place, but it doesn't seem to make mention of it.  I have a guess of where it could take place, but that could be my limited knowledge of the island as a whole.</p><p>Two of the characters are Catholic.  In the second episode Ritsuko and Sentaro attend church on Sunday, and then discuss their religion a little bit with the main character, Kaoru.  The introduction and expansion of Catholicism (and Christianity) in Japan started in Kagoshima and Nagasaki as trade with the dutch expanded.  Five and I watched the first 4 episodes over the weekend, and he made mention that he wondered if the popularity of western religion made it further than Kyushu before the Japanese government attempted to eradicate it.  In other words, to be a Japanese Catholic (or Christian) is a very Kyushu thing.</p><p>The second thing that my guess of setting is based on brings us back to the racist American in episode 4.  That entire scene happens in a Jazz bar near an American naval base.  The audience members are nearly all American sailors.  I think Okinawa is the most widely known about American Military base in Japan, and while technically it's part of Kyushu, I don't think the Japanese would call it Kyushu.</p><p>I think Sakamichi no Apollon takes place in <b>Sasebo</b>.  Sasebo has one of the largest American naval bases in Japan, and is not too far north of Nagasaki, so it's in the heart of Catholic and Christian expansion in Japan.  Looking up a few things on Google reveals that the Sasebo Tourist Center and the Sasebo High School have credits in Sakamichi no Apollon for Location Cooperation (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13944" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13944">credits</a>).</p><p>So, I'm right! :D</p><p>One of my good friends lives in Sasebo, too, so it's brings this show a bit closer to home for me, as well.</p><p>Something else that came about watching the show with Five was the use of Kyushu dialect by the characters.  I mean, aside from the main character, everyone lives and grew up in Kyushu so it makes sense that would have the accents.  Five was easily able to catch this as he lived in Nagasaki for 4 or 5 years, and worked in Omura (halfway between Nagasaki and Sasebo) for 2 or 3 years.  He mentioned that the dialect was present here and there, but it wasn't as strong as it should be.</p><p>It makes sense why they would do that for TV.  Almost all TV in Japan comes from Tokyo, so the Tokyo area dialect has become a standard for any television presence.  I'm guessing that they're shoving some Kyushu dialect in here and there to make it sound like it's from Kyushu, but still keeping it in line with the standard Tokyo TV dialect.</p><div class='title'><b>Good Stuff</b></div><p>Anywho, I like this show quite a bit, and can't wait to watch more of it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Timberline Lodge on Mt.

We went to the ocean, climbed some hills in his town, Eugene, and drove up to Portland a few times to take a look at some places.  On one of those trips to Portland, on the best most clearest day, we continued east in the direction of Mt Hood, Oregon's tallest mountain.</p><p>The Timberline Lodge is a national historic landmark and operating ski lodge on the southern slope of the mountain.  It's the highest occupied point of the mountain.  To get any further up the mountain, you'll have to go by foot, or by chair lift and then by foot.</p><p>On clear days, and in some areas of Portland, Mt. Hood is like a distant shadow.  It looms over the east, but it doesn't tower or demand the skyline.  It's like a powerful icon. </p><p>Out of Portland, we took the most direct route to Timberline.  Hwy 212 to Hwy 26.  Mt. Hood was always in our view as we continued our trek.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0220.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0223.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0227.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0230.webp" /></p><p>As the mountain grew and grew the temperature began to decline and the snow acculation became greater and greater.  It was 60 or 65 degrees back in Portland, but it was 40 degrees when we finally made it to Timberline.  It's amazing to think that it was Spring a mere 60 miles away.  As we turned on the road leading directly up to the Timberline Lodge, it was so icey that we had to pull over and engage our 4 wheel drive.</p><p>But!  We made it easily enough.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0394_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0394_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0394_stitch.webp" /></p><p>Inside was the beautiful, humble, rustic atmosphere you'd expect to find from the Ski Lodge of your dreams.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0241_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0241_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0241_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0241_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0241_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0267_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0267_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0267_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0267_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0267_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Fireplaces, wooden benches with coizy cushins, hot chocolate...  everything that promotes a warm atmosphere and protection from the sharp chill of the snowy mountain outside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0307_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0307_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0307_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0315_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0315_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0315_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0315_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0315_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>And this is as close as we got to the peak of Mt.

The building has its own restaurant, common area, bar, and rooms for the guests.  It probably has living quarters for some of the staff, too.  Though, I suppose commuting everyday wouldn't be too difficult.  It only took us an hour and a half from downtown Portland.  But, they'd probably need something for the staff if they were snowed in.  We were there on a pretty nice day and half the building was already under snow.</p><p>The Timeberline Lodge was in the middle of celebrating it's 75th Anniversary.  It was constructed between 1936 and 1937.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0232.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0232.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0232.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0389.webp" /></p><p>We looked around Timberline for a while, but then headed back down the mountain.  At the base of Timberline's driveway is a town called Government Camp.  It's a super cute, and super quaint mountain town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0415_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0415_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0415_stitch.webp" /></p><p>We stopped at the Visitor Center is town, which was completely covered in snow, and also had a museum with lots of information about the town.  One interesting factoid I remember is that American automotive companies used to have a constant about whose cars could make it to Government Camp from Portland the fastest (or at all) in the middle of January.  It usually took the cars a whole month to make the journey and a lot of the time the cars would get completely stuck or couldn't even make it over the terrain.  The teams would use horses to pull the car along or over whatever horrible obstacles they came across.</p><p>The museum also detailed plenty of expeditions to the peak of Mt. Hood, and displayed the original gear of these mountain climbers.  Most of the outfits were made of heavy cloth, and had plenty of rips and tears from the climb itself.  Googles were scratched, and you could barely see out of them.  It's like looking at our space shuttles and wondering how the hell we ever used these things to get anywhere.</p><p>Down the street is the Ice Axe Grill, home to the <a href="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/" title="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/">Mt. Hood Brewing Company</a>.  Even though this quaint little mountain town probably feels isolated from the rest of society, and especially when it snows 5 or 10 or 20 feet at a time, there's plenty of beer to go around.</p><p>It would be nice to live in such an isolated place.  Away from the constant distraction of a flourishing city, but I think the tranquil isolation would eventually become boring.  And I'm sure very little ever changes out there.  Those types of places probably feel like they live outside of time.</p><p>Anywho, Mt. Hood is beautiful, and it's fantastic how close it is to Portland.  I'd like to see how it looks over the summer, and actually get the chance to walk along some trails, and be able to see the mountain itself rather than just from the road.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards of Legend" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-of-legend">Cards of Legend</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

(Sea Lion's have visible ear flaps, while Seels do not).</p><p>The caves have a huge opening to the ocean, and just inside were a couple hundred Sea Lions hanging out, and making a lot of noise.  There was a fence separating us from them, so we weren't able to pet or hug them. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>The other end of the cave lead out to the original man-made entrance of the cave before the elevator was installed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>It was pretty neat, I guess.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Lion_Caves" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Lion_Caves">Wikipedia</a> has more information about the history of the caves.

The areas we were looking for were Devil's Churn, Cooks Chasm, Thor's Well, and a couple other natural formation of the ocean smashing into the rocky coast.  We stopped at the Visitor's Center to get a map, and a general idea of where these places might be.</p><p>We tried to find Thor's Well first, but it was a little difficult since it wasn't marked on any maps.  We stopped the car where we thought it was supposed to be and started walking along the coast.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9940_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9940_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9940_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9940_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9940_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0001_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0001_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0001_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0021_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0021_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0021_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0021_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0021_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0061_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0061_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0061_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0061_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0061_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0104_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0104_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0104_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0104_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0104_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to find anything resembling Thor's Well.

It continues into the rock ever further than the surface suggest.  Devil's Churn gets its name from the sound the waves make when the slam into the very end  of the crack.

For the 30 minutes we were mesmerized by this hole in the ground, we were able to get 2 of these waves that completely soaked our shoes and pants.  I was on higher rocks than Bill was, and I was still just as soaked.</p><p>I took some video of Thor's Well, in which I get soaked, again, around the 2 minute mark : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRDiup0UNDo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRDiup0UNDo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRDiup0UNDo</a></p><p>Overall, it was pretty neat to see this side of the Pacific.  I've seen it from the sky while flying back and forth to Japan, and seen it from the Japanese coast line, too, but never directly from the American side.</p><p>One things I was definitely looking for were traces of Tsunami debree from the March 12th Tohoku Earthquake.  There have been some recently news articles saying that people have been finding things on the coast, and, in fact, further north, a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17500008" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17500008">"ghost ship"</a> had found it's way to Canada after being removed from its Japanese port.</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not find anything substantial.  We found a car tire, and a bunch of plastic bottles, one of which DID look like a Japanese PET Bottle, but they were most likely just garbage from nearby.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/33">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/31">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
