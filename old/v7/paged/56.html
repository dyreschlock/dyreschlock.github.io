| May 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm a pretty lazy person.  I've had 2 months since I purchased airline tickets for Japan, but I still waited until the night before to do everything.  On Wednesday Night, I bought better insoles for my shoes, packed clothing, packed other stuff, paid rent, processed all my old photos still on my camera, watched Rescue Me.  I could have easily done this stuff on Tuesday, but decided to wait for I don't know why.</p><p>As such I got to bed around Midnight.  I wanted to get a good night's rest before my 8am flight, but It was not in the cards.  I had to wake up around 5:15am and get outside to catch a bus at 5:52 to head to the airport.  A transfer here, a transfer there, and I was at the airport.  A timely arrival didn't really matter though, since Chicago thunderstorms delayed my flight out of Madison about 2 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>O'hare</b></div><p>Eventually, I made it to Chicago with well enough time to catch my Narita flight.  So much time, in fact, that I walked around the airport.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3119.webp" /></p><p>O'hare has some very pretty areas that I hadn't seen before.  Usually what I see of O'hare is construction, or concrete walls.  The International flight areas is really pretty.  The corridor connecting Terminals B and C is underground and has rainbow lights that flicker along to classical music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3118.webp" /></p><p>Going back and forth along the conveyer belts took up enough of my free time.  I boarded the plane, sat in my seat, and off we went to Narita.  I choose the very last window seat on the left side of the plane: 61B.  Which was great in theory.  There was no one behind me to kick my seat!  However, directly behind me was a semi-open area for people to stand and stretch.  So I only slept a couple times, and 20 minutes at time for that matter.</p><p>The pilot was pretty efficient.  We got to Narita 20 minutes ahead of schedule!  However, that didn't make any difference.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The Japanese Health Administration was set into Panic mode thanks to the Swine Flu and EVERY incoming human to Japan had to be "Quarantined".  We sat on the plane for an additional 2 hours after our 12 hour flight for Health officials to board the plane and have us take an additional customs survey about our health.</p><p>One-by-one passenger-by-passenger they would receive our survey process it and then decide that we're OK.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3131.webp" /></p><p>Surprisingly, the people on the plane were understanding, despite the ridiculousness.  Everyone sat in their seat and waited.  I was probably the only one on the plane that didn't have a connecting flight, too.  We arrived at Narita around 2:20pm and I finally got off the plane around 4:15pm.  It's been about 21 hours since I've got any actual sleep.</p><div class='title'><b>Shibuya</b></div><p>The Narita Express took me directly to Shibuya where I plan on staying for my whole trip.  The second that I got off the train I started walking in the direction I thought was correct but was not.  I joked that I was totally get lost walking around Tokyo, but I didn't think I would get lost so early in my Journey.  Once I found a city map, I was turned toward the right direction.</p><p>The Hotel I planned on staying at was actually a Love Hotel.  I guess that's what I get for last minute research.  There was an actual hotel right around the corner though.  So I checked in, got in my room and finally went to sleep around 7:30pm (24 hours since I woke up at 5:15am in Madison).<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to To purchase a DSi?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/to-purchase-a-dsi">To purchase a DSi?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| April 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2 weeks ago Nintendo released the third generation of the Nintendo DS entitled the DSi. The DSi doesn't iterate on the visual design of the DS Lite, but makes several hardware changes. The screens are slightly bigger and brighter. The speakers are more clear. The power button has moved. They've also added 2 low quality cameras for some reason.</p><p>But the biggest change is the removal of the Gameboy Slot on the bottom of the unit. It's sad that nearly 20 years after the original release of the Gameboy that that name will no longer carried. But oh well.. It's been a very long time since I've even used that slot for games.</p><p>With removal of the GBA slot comes the addition of an SD card slot. The SD slot is located on the side where the power button used to be. The primary purchase for this is to store downloadable games and applications from the DSi store, which opened on the same day of the DSi launch.</p><div class='title'><b>Is it worth it?</b></div><p>Yes, yes, all these features are all well and good but does this really warrant a purchase? There's a little bit more processor power, and a little bit bigger screens. But essentially the DSi is identical to the DS Lite. There's no killer-app on the DSi store and no plans for DSi specific games. Why waste $170 buying a new DS?</p><p>Well, my reason for wanting a DSi is the same reason a few others are willing to "upgrade": My DS is beat to shit. I own a launch Japanese DS and over these past 3 years my DS has been my most played gaming platform. I've played the thing so much the touch screen can no longer be re-calibrated to precision. Those super-market credit card signature pads have more precision than my DS touch screen. Trauma Center is unplayable!</p><p>In addition, there's been a tiny renaissance of games lately. (ie: Pokemon Platinum, Tokyo Beat Down, Docomo Dake, Retro Game Challenge, Harry Hatsworth.) There's also a few future titles to look forward to. (ie: Edgeworth Perfect Prosecutor and Zelda Train Simulator.) There's also some great games from the past year that I missed. (ie: Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Trauma Center 2, Bangaioh Spirits.)</p><p>I think an upgrade to workable DS hardware isn't such a bad idea.</p><div class='title'><b>Region locking</b></div><p>Up until now, all Nintendo portable hardware was region free. You can play any Japanese games on an American DS and vice versa. But Nintendo had announced that the Nintendo DSi is region locked. What does that actually mean, though?</p><p>Well, for #1: The Japanese DSi will only have access to the Japanese DSi store. Americans can only access the American store. I think that was already obvious given the way the Wii store works. Unlike Xbox or PSN, the region is embedded in the device itself. So the only way to access a store outside of your region is the purchase the device for that region.</p><p>Pros: Access to kooky Japanese games not available in the US. Games like the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html">Katamari Puzzle</a> game, which may or may not actually be fun. The Art Style series which includes <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html">Decode</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html">Pico Pict</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html">Somnium</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html">Hacolife</a>, and a couple others. These games remind me a lot of Bit Generations. The Dr. Mario games is over there too.</p><p>Cons: I won't have access to the American games. Though, I don't really see this as much of a Con since the games I care about will already be on the Japanese DSi store.</p><p>#2: DSi Region locking could also mean that DSi specific cartridge based games are un-playable on other regioned devices. Though, this hasn't actually been confirmed since Nintendo has not mentioned any plans of making DSi specific games. However, if they did plan to make DSi specific games, and they were region locked than I would not be able to play American games.</p><p>#3: DLC. Let's say cartridges were not region locked and they were some DSi-only cartridge games. Well, if Nintendo introduced DLC for these titles, it wouldn't be able to access the store for my American games. Though, are there any games for Wii that have DLC?</p><div class='title'><b>Do I buy import?</b></div><p>Personally, I'm going to bet on DSi-only carts being region-free, even though I really have no proof to back that up. That's a problem for future-Me anyways, since all current DS software is region free.</p><p>The decision of whether I buy domestic or import comes to down to the DSi store. It's hard to judge the American DSi store after a mere two weeks of operation, but there are definitely some Japanese games that will never be released here.</p><p>So, I think I will buy a Japanese DSi. They are $20 more expensive than the US ones and come in a few colors not available in the US including <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html">Pink, Navy and Lime</a>.</p><p>In 10 days, I leave for Japan. When I'm over there I'll either chose a Navy or Lime one. Who knows, though. I might change my mind while I'm in Japan.

The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a></p><div class='title'><b>Success</b></div><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-2">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's quite incredible. The suspense is perfectly controlled leading to the finale. It builds from the little bits of plot and story peppered in the beginning and gradually mounting an explosion in the end.</p><p>Season 2 really doesn't quite compare. Though, it tries to do the same thing. And has a pretty decent starting point with the aftermath of Season 1. It does a great job of building off the previous season and builds a story of its own, which also leads to a great ending. Unfortunately, the main focus is split.</p><p>Season 1 has a very clear focal point that everything centers on. There are 2 main plots that eventually weave together into one. Season 2 has a focal point, but there is too much plot. And just a little bit of story. Thankfully it's masked but consistant suspense.</p><p>Season 2 is still decent, but Season 1 is great.</p><p>Don't talk to me about Season 3.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nuka Cola Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nuka-cola-recipe">Nuka Cola Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I had a particular spiffy weekend planned that ended up with way too many foibles and screw-ups.</p><p>My Friday plans ultimately took me to Chicago to see french synth rock band M83. I left work a little early to board a bus to Milwaukee, meet up with Dave, have some dinner, and drive down to Chicago. We went to a marvelous Mexican restaurant on the south-side of Milwaukee, went to a couple stores I had wanted to go to, and then headed south down 94.</p><p>M83 were playing at The Bottom Lounge. A venue that I assumed would be like any other venue I've been to where an electronic genre band would play. Some 'trendy' place with a constant flow of eletronica music building up to M83's performance. This was not the case. The Bottom Lounge was more of an indie rock venue where bands are setup on stage without an interim DJ to streamline to setup and tear down process.</p><p>So when we arrived around 10:30pm, which would've been the perfect build time to the night's headliners and a decent amount of attendance, I was quite perturbed to realize that the 9pm time on the ticket didn't mean "Doors at 9pm", it meant 9pm. Balls.</p><p>That was a secondary concern, though, considering that M83's performance sold out. Dave insisted that I, at least, spend my ticket I paid for. I did. And 15 minutes later, M83 finished up and tore down their equipment and readied the stage for the next band. Rather than pay for expensive beer in the "waiting room," we decided to drive around Chicago a little bit and then head home.</p><p>On the plus-side, M83 are fantastic. Their songs build layer after layer. Their voices, guitars and sound play in absolute harmony building this strong, powerful, warm aura. Apparently, M83 were huge earlier in the decade and hadn't produced anything new until this year. This tour was a slight comeback for their career. I may have heard some of their music before, but I didn't really know their name until their track appeared on Sasha's Involver 2. It's one of my favorite tracks on there, so I figured this would be a worthwhile event. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, I completely screwed up that night. Oh well...<br/>____</p><p>On Saturday, I had a date with a girl I went out with a few times in the past few weeks. Everything seemed to be going great with her. We really enjoyed each others company. But she dumped me because she's busy all the time and doesn't really have time to date.</p><p>On the plus-side, I now know of a Driving Range that's pretty close to my apartment and is open all winter long!<br/>____</p><p>For Sunday, Tony and I had tickets for the Madison Opera's production of Madama Butterfly. Madama Butterfly is set around Glover Garden in Nagasaki. Pinkerton, a US Navyman, meets Butterfly, a geisha, while stationed in Nagasaki. They fall in love, and are wed. Pinkerton must return to the US, though, and he leaves Butterfly in Japan. That's the first act. The second act focuses on Butterfly and her resolve and dedication for Pinkerton. And in the third act, Pinkerton returns, but not with joyful news.</p><p>MY GOD can opera be boring. I think one of their larger mistakes was omitting the second intermission with 5 minutes of low-light visual aura and pleasant somber music describing the evening turning into night turning into midnight turning into morning. I nearly fell asleep at several points.</p><p>I screwed up this event by forgetting the tickets at home by the time we arrived at the parking garage. We finally got into the overture center 20 minutes after Madama had already begun. We were able to watch the first act on monitors they had in the waiting room, but the quality was so horrible, you couldn't even read the translation.</p><p>It was certainly interesting to see a production of Madama Butterfly, but the aesthetic of Madama Butterfly is more opera oriented rather than Japanese oriented, so it fell a little flat for me.<br/>____</p><p>Between these failures, I bought a couple new records on Saturday morning and watched a bunch of sad movies on Sunday and now I'm under the weather today for some reason.
