In European cultures, handed down to America, we had always viewed this image as a face, dubbing it The Man in the Moon. However, in Japanese history (and also China and other Asian countries), they don't see a face. They see a rabbit. Since living here and looking at the moon, I see it, too. It always looks two ears flopped over a crouching body fit into a circle. </p><p>I once read somewhere that claimed part of the difference of opinion was because the angle of moon when viewed in Japan was different when viewed in America. In Japan, the moon was rotated counter-clockwise which put the rabbit's ears up a bit higher, making the rabbit more distinguishable. This seemed like nonsense because Japan and America are on the same latitude. The moon doesn't spin that way.</p><p>One night while in America visiting family, there was a beautiful clear night. A few clouds, but the moon is full and illuminated the darkness. I wanted to photograph proof of this difference.</p><p>Here's the American moon shot in August 2025.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" /></a></p><p>And here's the Japanese moon <a href="/old/v7/super-moon" title="/super-moon">shot in November 2016</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It is rotated by quite a bit! </p><p>But... this rotation could be because of a lot of things. This is August versus November.</p><p>Here's another photo of the Japanese moon <a href="/old/v7/september-moon" title="/september-moon">from September 2014</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" /></a></p><p>It's rotated even more!</p><p>Perhaps it's not the difference in time of the year, but the time of night? The September shots were from dusk. However, the 2016 and 2025 shots were both taken around 10pm at night.</p><p>Is the moon really rotated slightly on the other side of Earth even though it's the same hemisphere?</p><p>This rotation clearly makes it easier to notice a Rabbit in the Moon compared to a Man in the Moon.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Minnesota State Capitol" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/minnesota-state-capitol">Minnesota State Capitol</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The first people began settling in the Stillwater area in 1843 with a logging company. At the time, Stillwater was part of Wisconsin territory on the very western edge. As the logging company and settlement grew, they broke away from Wisconsin and aligned with the settlement in Saint Paul in 1849 to create Minnesota territory.</p><p>With its new territory, Minnesota decided to spend $20,000 to create a sophistated and safe penitentiary. Construction began in May 1851 and the first state-of-the-art prison in the Midwest was finished in 1853. Apparently it's "telephone pole" layout became very infuential in the creation of future prisons.</p><p>One year later in 1854, Stillwater was officially incorporated as a city. On the same day, Saint Paul was incorporated as well. These were Minnesota's first official cities. (Minneapolis was founded in 1856 and incorporated in 1867.) Four years later in 1858, Minnesota would officially become the 32nd state of America.</p><p>This building, the Warden's House, was completed on the same day of the prison in early 1853. The first warden, Francis R. Delano, moved in on April 4th, 1853.</p><p>These days, Stillwater has a new prison on the south end of town away from the city. It's clearly visible when driving on Hwy 36 over St. Croix River. It was built in 1912 and has been in operation ever since. Wardens or deputy wardens still used the Warden's House until 1941 when it was given to the Washington County Historical Society. And in 1974, it was listed on the National Registry of Historial Places.</p><p>As both Wikipedia and the plaque in front of the house says, it is a symbol of significance for Minnesota's history as one of the only surviving buildings from its origin. The home is filled with many artifacts dating back nearly a century. However, a lot of the stuff has been donated from other wealthy families at the time. Not everything was owned by the weathly wardens.</p><p>When I was back in the states, I visited the home with my family, and I took many photos. According to the tour guide, the house is haunted, but I didn't find any ghostly images. Maybe I missed something in my photos, though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-biggest-ball-of-twine-in-minnesota">The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

For decades, people have thrown themselves into the irony of traveling across counties, states, and even countries just to see this giant ball of twine. Me too. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4816_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The official title of the attraction is The World's Largest Twine Ball by One Man. They needed to add that final clarification at the end because of competition from Ripley's Believe It or Not. In the late 80s, they wanted to buy the Twine Ball for their museum of oddities. The proprietors of the Twine Ball at the time refused as it would've removed the attraction from their town. </p><p>As a response, Ripley's made their own massive twine ball. Some other copycats in the US did the same. Ripley's project eventually surpassed the size of Darwin's Twine Ball, but it was assembled by a team of people, not a single man.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4825_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That man was Francis Johnson, born in 1904, died in 1989. He was a builder, tinkerer, and wood carver who lived his life in Darwin, MN. He began putting together the Twine Ball in 1950, tying together used strips of baller twine donated from his farming friends.</p><p>By 1958, the ball has grown to a 6-foot diameter. He would load the ball on his truck for the town parade each year. He also traveled with it across the country to New York City to appear on TV. He stopped adding to the ball in 1979 when he was 75 years old. At that point, the diameter reached about 12 feet. It was the World's Largest Ball of Twine until 1994 when Ripley's ball surpasseed it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4830_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In August 2001, the city of Darwin moved their old train depot behind the twine ball. The train depot was a museum of Darwin history, and now it could also house the souvenir shop for the Twine Ball and the many photos of tourists who came from around the world to visit.</p><p>My first time visiting the Twine Ball was a few months before this happened. My friends and I drove out to the Twine Ball on March 12th, 2001 to finally see this thing Weird Al had told me about all those years ago. I was able to recently recover the photos, <a href="/old/v7/twine-ball-2001" title="/twine-ball-2001">so you can view them here</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/010312_twineball/MVC-003S.webp" /></a></p><p>Every year, the City of Darwin celebrates Twine Ball Days with a parade and festival, live music and beer tents. It was held on August 9th this year, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Twine Ball's creation. I went to visit the ball during the week, though, so I could get some clean photos without crowds of people.</p><p>There are future plans for the Twine Ball. One of the town's residents recently purchased the adject Twine Ball Inn, which had been closed for years. The inside had been completely gutted, and she plans on turning it into an actual Inn on airbnb. Sounds fun. :) But, who knows how long that'll happen with the state of the world.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250801_darwin_twine/IMG_4971_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In honor of Weird Al's contribution to the Twine Ball's fame, the short road next to the park was renamed to Weird Alley in 2019, just a few days before he performed at the Minnesota State Fair that year. While it was difficult for him to travel to Darwin, volunteers from the town were able to meet him at the fair and give him an updated T-shirt.</p><p>I'm not sure if it's actually worth the time to travel an hour west of Minneapolis to see the Twine Ball, but it's a kitchy thing to do if you have a spare morning or afternoon. <br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Game Collection Sold (mostly)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-collection-sold-mostly">Game Collection Sold (mostly)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 31, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Leading into summer, I decided to sell off a signficant chunk of my games collection. Since childhood (but really since college), I wanted to build a library of games. I wanted to have shelves of all the best games for each of my favorite platforms and prominently face my favorites. I even had dreams of opening my own game store at one point.</p><p>A lot of folks of my generation had the same feelings and you can see images of their libraries show up on all kinds of social media. However, these days, building such a collection seems totally unnecessary. One of my original goals for building a collection was access. </p><p>I wanted to always be able to play these games in the future. But games preservation is incredible these days. All consoles from the mid 90s and before can be replicated with near perfect accuracy using FPGA software. For consoles of the Playstation 2 era, mods exist to give you immediate access to hundreds of games from the greats to the goofy. I don't need the originals anymore.</p><p>Additionally, I moved overseas over 12 years ago now. Even though I own the original games, I don't have access to them as they're back in the US, half a world away. Also, even if I was able to bring all those games here, I don't have room for them. All of my stuff has been burning space away in my mother's basement, and each time I go home, I am reminded of it (not be her).</p><p>So, with far greater access to these games through FPGA and modded consoles, I decided to go deep on getting rid of them. It was time to make some heavy cuts. And ultimately I would sell HALF of my physical collection. I sold a total of <b>264 games</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Deep Cuts</b></div><p>The main cuts of my collection came from Playstation and Sega Saturn.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I bought so many Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games while I was in college and the years after. I often went on raids to rural department stores and used stores. I would mark all these places on maps and hit every single one on weekends driving out of town. </p><p>Then I did the same when I studied abroad in Japan and the subsequent trips after. In 2006, I was coming back from Book Off and Geo with bags full of Saturn games and accessories, and other unique Playstation games that never came to the US.</p><p>I had a pretty amazing collection, but it all sat dormant in my Mom's basement. If I wanted to play any of these games, I already had access to them in my home in Japan. Holding on to all these games really served no purpose other than nostalgia. And I had so many games that I bought and never played that my nostalgia wasn't really all that strong for the majority of them. (That being said, there were several games I did not sell because of nostalgia.)</p><div class='title'><b>Quick Save Games</b></div><p>While I always try to sell things on eBay, it's fucking terrible now. eBays takes about 40% of the money you make for all sales. Plus, if you sell more than $600, you need to claim it as income unless you prove you aren't making a profit by submitting receipts. The alternative is Facebook Marketplace, but I have never used it before and had no luck with my meager postings.</p><p>One of my friends mentioned a used games store in Madison WI that had knowledgable staff and offered fair current prices for games. I had always balked at the idea of selling to a store because you will never get a fair price. They are buying your inventory to sell and they must make a profit. But, my friend vouched for them. This was <b>Quick Save Games</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I made a detailed list of the games I wanted to get rid of, and I sent them an email asking what they thought. They replied and after going through each individual game, they sent me a quote. Ultimately, this was far easier and faster than creating individual entries on eBay. Plus, I didn't have to mess with shipping and all that. Obviously, I wasn't getting 100% of the current price, but I was never going to get that through eBay.</p><p>After the first quote, I created a second list with further cuts into my collection, and (as mentioned above) my eventual total was <b>264 games</b>. Also, I was able to get rid of all my extra Amiibos, game soundtracks, and artbooks.</p><div class='title'><b>Road Trip</b></div><p>I collected all of my games into six bins, packed the bins into my Mom's car, and drove the 5 hours from Minneapolis down to Madison. They opened at Noon, so I stopped at a few places along the way.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I thought it would be a pretty quick drop off and I'd have time to go to the bank, but it took them 5 hours to verify and price everything. That's not really a slight, though. They had to go through around 350 pieces of merchandise nonstop over 5 hours on their work day, all with me waiting on him so I could go back to Minneapolis. Even with prep work from the list I gave, they still had to do inventory, verification, and I also added some more stuff that I shoved in there at the last minute.</p><p>It was a signficant amount of work, and they went through things far more meticulously than any part-time folk at a lesser reselling store. I'm not sure what site they were using for prices (I think it could've been PriceCharting?), but it was very thorough and I was able to get an excellent return on all my games immediately.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Quick Save Games is a pretty amazing store. They have a signficant amount variety from all eras of gaming. They had Atari games, Genesis games, Nintendo, Playstation, Sega CD, Saturn, Xbox 360, and several Japanese games, too. They had some esoteric US releases, but nothing crazy esoteric, like a PC FX or an arcade board. It reminded me a lot of the stores I would visit 20 years ago. :)</p><p>One thing they really complained about was their space. I was really surprised at how little space they had. Some of my items were refused because they "didn't have space," but that was not just an excuse to refuse buying my Kickstarter copy of Wasteland on PC. Where would they put it here?</p><p>Also, despite being on the edge of town in Fitchburg, they got a lot of traffic. I haven't lived in Madison for over a decade, but there's not really much down there, right? I dunno. I must be wrong because they had a bunch of folks come through while I was there.</p><p>If you're down in Madison, I would absolutely recommend taking a look. It only opened in the last 2 years, and it seems like they often get new inventory.</p><div class='title'><b>Collection Halved</b></div><p>So, I went from <b>503</b> physical games down to <b>277</b>.

I couldn't get rid of any <b>Zelda</b> games or mainline <b>Final Fantasy</b> games, either.</p><p>Also, I kept my most expensive games, too. <b>Panzer Dragoon Saga</b> for the American Saturn remains as my most expensive game.

Plus all of the Zelda releases for Gamecube, many of which are sealed. My collection still has quite a bit of value. :)</p><p>While it does hurt to get rid of so much of what I built for myself, it felt really good to take a chunk out of my mountain of stuff that had been weighing me down for so long.

I visited State St and the Square and was shocked at how much the place had fallen apart, due to a combination of Covid and people working from home. Stores were boarded up and gone. They were in the process of tearing down some buildings. And homeless folks were everywhere.</p><p>There were always homeless people in Madison, but they were among the many other people walking around, working, and living in the area. Now, it felt empty and ravaged. I don't think the downtown area of Madison was the only place in America that has fallen apart in recent years. (Visiting the city during a rainstorm probably also contributed to the gloomy atmosphere.)</p><p>Anyways, one of my destinations in Madison was to visit where I used to work, Widen Enterprises. After graduating university, I worked for Widen Enterprises as a Software Developer for over 7 years and then worked abroad for them a litlte bit after coming to Japan.</p><p>Widen Enterprises had a history of print which began in the 40s. They first began detailing and manufacturing plates for newsprint and then broke into catalog printing in the 60s. In the 90s, they invested in developing a user interface and backend that would aid their customers and building these catalogs. This move was perfect syngery with their printing service.</p><p>However, with the Internet becoming more and more ubiquitous, print died and their software division grew considerably. During my years of working there, the printing division became smaller and smaller. The basement used to have huge printers for all their costumer's catalogs. As company's workflows moved online, less and less were printing and these printers just took up space. Just after I left, I think the entire print division was disbanded.</p><p>Widen's Digital Asset Management system grew to become their main focus and now it had become their only focus. When I began work there, we occupied half of the top floor. After I left, the building was remodeled and development took over the entire ground floor.</p><p>Even before the Covid years, I think many developers and staff worked from home at least one day a week. And then during Covid, I think everyone switched to remote working. Not uncommon for companies in the US.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, in September 2021, they sold the company to Acquia. Acquia's main product is a line of content management software for your enterprise website. Having a digital asset management system is powerful tool to allow your costumers to host all their product images and use their software to build their corporate website or commerical website around it.</p><p>Over the 4 years of ownership and looking at some staff listsing at Acquia, it looks like much of the brilliant excellent folks at Widen have been moved into more senior roles within Acquia. From other rumors, it seems like much of Widen's staff has either been absorbed into other areas of Acquia or left the company altogether.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the old Widen building is for sale. It is no longer used by any developers or staff still working on DAM, wherever they may be. I think Widen had been at this location since the late 60s or 70s? Some of the other print buildings in the area still look like they're in business. It seems like a blight to have one of the major businesses in the area gone.</p><p>Someone had recently mowed the lawn, so it doesn't look too bad. But there are still some overgrown plants around the parking lot. Nobody comes here. (The overgrowth is much more present on Google Street View.) I'm not sure when they sold the building. Maybe it was still being used in late 2023?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While I was in the US, I drove past many corporate buildings and businesses that were completely empty because of the workforce moving online. I'm not a fan of working from home, but my commute to work is only 5 minutes in this dense mountain town. If I had to drive 45 minutes to work every day in a dense metro traffic, I would probably prefer working from home, too.</p><p>While everything feels like it's falling apart in the states, I think it's a consequence of transitioning the next (or another) form of our society. And change hurts.</p><p>It still <a href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead" title="/toys-r-us-is-dead">sucks that another one of my former workplaces is gone.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Badger Army Ammunition Plant" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/badger-army-ammunition-plant">Badger Army Ammunition Plant</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I learned about how the Japanese people threw themselves into nationalism and made the war more about an attack on their nation's pride rather than about human rights. And I learned about how they suffered as a result. I've seen and learned a lot from the Japanese point of view having visited war sites and museums in Nagasaki, Hiroshima, and Okinawa. </p><p>I've never been to any war sites in America. Honestly, we really don't have many at all because we never had any part of our homeland touched by war. Our military bases are still in use, and if they are decommissioned, they are demolished. Our experience in war has almost always been foreign.</p><p>When I was back in the states over summer, I wanted to visit a location I had heard about while living in Madison. The Badger Munitions Factory was a plant near Baraboo to the north that developed and manufactured bullets for our soldiers in World War II.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The actual full title was The Badger Army Ammunition Plant, and they did not directly manufacture bullets. Scientists and workers in the plant devleloped and synthesized Nitric Acid and Sulfric Acid combined with other agents to create rocket propellant, smokeless powder used in rifle bullets and tank shells, and explosion powder used in hand grenades and tear gas canisters.</p><p>The plant itself only developed and shipped the powder. Other plants and factors in the midwest received the powder and used them in ammunition.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, there's not much to see. Full demolition of all buildings was completed in 2013. The security gate entrance was still standing, and seemed like the only remaining original building in the lot. Outside of the entrance, to the left, was a memorial stone showing the families that "gave up" their land for the plant to be built. To the right was a modern building that served as the museum to the plant and a headquarters for the Badger History Group.</p><p>The grounds inside the fence were open to explore, but there were many No Trespassing signs indicating that lands were owned by the Ho-Chunk Nation. Later, I noticed that not all of the lands were in possession of the Ho-Chunk, and it was okay to drive around most of the area.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I did drive around the area anyways and found a pair of storage shelters. Looking online through old photos, these appear to be a few more original buildings. These days, some local farmers were using them to store hay bails.</p><p>The museum was pretty fascinating. There were tons of photos taken during its operation, many relics from the buildings, and several displays showing the temperature of the times. While the plant's main use was for World War II, it was put into operation again from 1951 to 1957 for the Korean War, and from 1965 to 1975 for Vietnam. Protesters from UofM came up to the plant to protest in the late 60s.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plant really only had those three major periods of operation. In 1977, the army put the plant on hiatus. In 1997, the plant was deemed unnecessary. A series of corporations exchanged control of the environmental cleanup and eventually demolition, which completed in 2013. The land was divided up mainly between the US Department of Agriculture, the Ho-Chunk Nation, and the National Park Service.</p><p>If I get a chance, it would be nice to return on a sunny day. I didn't explore too much because of the rain, and photos looked terrible. Although, I guess I'm not really sure what else I'll see. Search for cement foundations of buildings and take photos? It would be more interesting to take aerial photos.</p><p>The badger museum and the entrance gateway had maps that I didn't fully study at the time. I think <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSY9ZAxLWxwuj23HGyucOjYYmrqSwzvy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSY9ZAxLWxwuj23HGyucOjYYmrqSwzvy/view?usp=drive_link">this map was an early version</a>. Here's a clear one printed by the Sauk Prarie Conservation Alliance.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1udJKEzxvJc5N5OqmTYB3sikRPmvbhRHP/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1udJKEzxvJc5N5OqmTYB3sikRPmvbhRHP/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/badger_lands_map-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/badger_lands_map-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/badger_lands_map-1.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking at the map, you can clearly see how the land was divided. Also, there was so much much more to this area than I original thought. Those storage shelters were still only near the entrance. I didn't travel anywhere near any of the other points of interest listed here. I am too used to living in Japan where everything is so dense, so I did not imagine this area to be miles!</p><p>I think I will try to return next time I'm back in the states.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The museum was an excellent resource of the history of the plant and it was completely free. They sold some books and asked for donations, but it was not required. An old man was stationed there and talked a lot about the working conditions in the plant and safety. (I wasn't really paying attention, though, sorry.)</p><p>I grabbed some flyers on my way out, and scanned them when I got back home.</p><p>Badger Army Ammunition Museum flyer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr7c7QuLElsN15224dVh3CfREuRr1Ki/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr7c7QuLElsN15224dVh3CfREuRr1Ki/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_museum_flyer.pdf</a><br/>Badger History Group flyer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRhghSeTETvOp46ETeJIbAkERAgQGyjy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRhghSeTETvOp46ETeJIbAkERAgQGyjy/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_history_flyer.pdf</a><br/>Badger Ammo Plant - A Different View: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvxlEx6n_NK1LJlyGZq9YyTMDorA0KLI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvxlEx6n_NK1LJlyGZq9YyTMDorA0KLI/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_plant_flyer.pdf</a></p><p>I'm not sure if I was supposed to take that last one. It seems like an original flyer from the 90s before the plant was decommissioned.</p><p>Overall, the museum had a far different vibe than any war museum I've visited in Japan (except for <a href="/old/v7/historical-records" title="/historical-records">the Historical Records Office</a> in Takayama). There was an overall underlying sense of pride of what was created here that never hinted at any guilt or responsibility of what would become of their product. All of the information seemed to focus on facts and presented the information like you could gleefully put yourself in the shoes of the workers.</p><p>I suppose when you "win" the war, you can gloss over the gravity of events that got you to the finish line.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to St Croix River Riverboat" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/st-croix-river-riverboat">St Croix River Riverboat</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The downtown area still keeps its flat storefront image, and one of the key features of the town is the vertically lifting bridge over the St. Croix River. To keep with its traditional roots, a company still offers rides of Riverboats that travel up and down the river.</p><p>My mother and I met up with my sister for a hot afternoon to try the experience. I think a lot of people tend to use the riverboat as an excuse to drink and have some decent food. But everything is so expensive these days. We just stuck with the buffet and enjoyed the views.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/5">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/3">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
