A movie that can be engaging, can be captivating, and overall you emotionally invest yourself in from the start.  Whether, you love the characters, love the environment, love the music or any other part of it, you are brought into the world with such force that you tune out everything else.  This movie (or game) becomes part of you.</p><p>With such beauty it brings itself to the absolute climax and you are there riding along side it..  You are there with the characters, with the scene as it unfolds.  and BAM.. it hits you.  That feeling of absolute beauty.  So much beauty fills you.. overflows through you..  so much so, that can't help but shed a tear.</p><p>Pure Happiness ^_^</p><p>That's how I feel every time I watch <b>Princess Mononoke</b>.  That's how I feel when Ashitaka and San return the head to the Dear God, he revives himself, and then falls to his death..  At that split moment, when all the destruction, all the hate, and all the war is whisked away into the air..  The peaceful, raped, and bare land lays still..  until the buds of life begin to grow.  The brown scorched hills begin to breathe green from its soil, as the piano solo starts..</p><p>:sniff:..  it's so beautiful..</p><p>It's hard to hold back your emotions when you realize that life does move on..  With all the sadness, anger, and horror, life will always prevail.</p><p>Oddly enough, wasn't it a decade ago when it first came out in theaters?  :looks it up: .. nope, I'm wrong.  It came out in October 1999 in US theaters.  Heh, that was a good movie date..  I went with both Michelle and Lindsey (co-workers at Toys R Us) to Plymouth Manns theater the day it came out.  However, it did release in Japanese theaters in July of 1997.</p><p>Hopefully, whomever holds the North American rights will release a Blu-ray version of Mononoke in the near future.</p><p>Anyways, aside from <b>Princess Mononoke</b>, there is one other movie that captivates me with so much emotion..  and that is <b>Garden State</b>.  I should really buy myself a copy of that movie.  That's the one with Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  I think there may have been others, but i cannot recall.</p><p>Excellent movies..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rock Band US Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rock-band-us-tour">Rock Band US Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As part of the Rock Band release this holiday season, MTV is rolling trucks around the US promoting the Rock Band atmosphere of the game up on stages.  Rock Band, by the way, is a rhythm game by Harmonix, the creators of Guitar Hero.  Rock Band has 4 "instruments": Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums and Vocals.  Form your own video game Rock Band this christmas season!</p><p>Rock Band seems like it'd be pretty fun in the atmosphere they are presented with this stage and crowds.  You really get to live out your fantasy as a rock legend with your Guitar Hero skills.  However, I don't really see THAT atmosphere transferring to the home what-so-ever.  How is playing with 4 people in the same room with a crowd of a couple people compare against playing by yourself with 3 other friends online?  It can't compare at all.</p><p>Rock Band is a purely social game that can only be played with a dozen people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rock Band Tour hits Milwaukee</b></div><p>Anyways, back on topic..  The Rock Band Tour just kicked off this week, and one of their first destinations was Milwaukee.  These tour dates can be found on Rock Band's website: <a href="http://rockband.com" title="http://rockband.com">http://rockband.com</a>.  The tour dates for Milwaukee are incredibly vague though..</p><p>Thu 9/13 - UW-Milwaukee Campus - TBA<br/>Fri 9/14 - TBA<br/>Sat 9/15 - Best Buy - Location TBA<br/>Sun 9/16 - Best Buy - Location TBA</p><p>O_o..  Way to organize yourself MTV.  With no indication of time or exact place, I decided to make a day of it anyways and got Tony to come with me ^_^.  I called up Jin, a former UW-Platteville student, now UW-Milwaukee student, if he had any more information, and also if he wanted to join us.</p><p>Jin had no idea what I was talking about, "No.. I haven't seen anything around campus advertising it or anything indicating anything at all."  Hmm...</p><p>While at work today, he gave me a phone call to say that he knew someone that had spotted the Rock Band truck on campus, back in the Klotche Center parking lot.  Huzzah!  Information..  It pays to know people all over the place ^_^.   With the location in hand, and the road ahead.. Tony and I left Madison around 4.30p and took off to UW-Milwaukee to check out the Rock Band Tour.</p><div class='title'><b>UW-Milwaukee</b></div><p>Getting to UW-Milwaukee wasn't too bad..  I missed one turn that cost us about 10 minutes, and then finding a parking spot took another 10 minutes.  We got to the Klotzche Center to notice the Rock Band Truck!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" /></p><p>The truck was all locked up though, and the canvas was pulled down..  They were certainly closed, but it seemed ready to open at some point.  I figured they were going to do a night event with fog lamps, lasers..  the whole works!  "Well...  let's go find something to eat and then come back.. maybe they'll be open then."</p><p>Tony and I walked across the Milwaukee campus to find some food.  The whole UW-Milwaukee campus is very cramped together, stuck on 3 main blocks in northern Milwaukee..  like 5 minutes north of downtown Milwaukee.  It has all the college buildings stuck together on a block, and all the residence halls stuck together on a block..  So much college in such a little space, gave me a really weird feeling..  it didn't really feel like an actual University to me.  :shrugs:</p><p>Anyways, after dinner, I gave Jin a call to ask him what he was up to and what his plans were.</p><div class='title'><b>Disappointment</b></div><p>Apparently, the Rock Band thing was going on all day and actually ended around 4 or 5pm..  So we missed it.</p><p>There was so many things wrong with their whole setup in the first place, though.  As Jin pointed out to me, There was absolutely no advertising for this events AT ALL.  It was basically word of mouth which didn't work.  In addition, the Klotzche Center parking was on the far edge of campus behind the building in a parking lot only fit about 20 cars..  as you can see from the photo above.</p><p>Also, according to Jin, all the "roadies" MTV hired to help out with setup and, perhaps, advertising, were mainly hired from madison.  These people got totally trashed the night before hand, and simply stiffed the morning crew.  They didn't even show up, so the few people left had a very rocky morning having the setup everything themselves.</p><p>As these failing factors resulted in poor turnout and an overall failure of the event.  I suppose if they had their act together they probably would have still been open by the time Tony and I arrived.</p><p>Booooooooo.</p><p>Well, i'm sure they'll have far better results when setting up for a Best Buy store..  They'll have paid employees to give a hand..  Plus, as Tony mentioned, Best Buy's will probably have their own Rock Band setup close to launch time, so they'll be plenty of chances to play the game with a crowd nearby and not having to purchase the game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Treasure remaking itself" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/treasure-remaking-itself">Treasure remaking itself</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today's featured news item comes from 1up, which seems to be the only video game news site that really hunts down today's new with the retro in mind.</p><p><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162744" title="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162744">http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162744</a></p><p>Kickass Japanese Developer <b>Treasure</b> has announced this week that their next game will be yet another remake of one of their classics.  This third remake will be of <b>Bangai-O</b> originally released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast.</p><div class='title'><b>Guardian Heroes</b></div><p>3 years ago, Treasure remade their classic Guardian Heroes on the Gameboy Advance.  Guardian Heroes was originally released on the Sega Saturn back in 1996.</p><p>Guardian Heroes is considered the benchmark for the beat-em-up genre, featuring a pure blend of leveling, brawling, and balance between all playable characters, much like Golden Axe and Gauntlet.  Something that Guardian Heroes really expanding on move-sets, so it had all the moves of a fighter, but was a 5 or 6 player co-op brawler.</p><p>There really hasn't been any game since then to top the this wonderfully designed arcade style classic.</p><p>In 2004, <b>Advance Guardian Heroes</b> was released with very disappointing results.  I've never played it, nor owned it, but I have seen it around for pretty cheap, so perhaps I'll pick it up at some point.</p><p>The US version of Guardian Heroes fetches a pretty hefty price on ebay these days.  Luckily, I was able to snag a Japanese copy for about $26 while studying abroad. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Gunstar Heroes</b></div><p>Right after Advance Guardian Heroes, Treasure set forth to remake another one of their classics, Gunstar Heroes.  Gunstar Heroes was actually Treasure's first game, right after Masato Maegawa and a bunch of his friends split from Konami.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes is a character shmup.  You play Blue or Red as you blast away hordes upon hordes of enemies that never stop coming.  You just keep killing and killing and killing.  It's great fun ^_^ and is considered one of the best shmups of the sub-genre.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes was made for the Sega Genesis and made full use of the hardware.  It was released along side Sega hardcore Arcade lineup and found an excellent home.</p><p>In Oct of 2005, Treasure released <b>Gunstar Super Heroes</b> for the Gameboy Advance.  This release also saw a disappointed release as the public really had no idea what Gunstar Heroes was.</p><p>Despite the poor sales, It's really an amazing game.  It's Treasure's love letter to Sega fans, using several themes of the Arcade Genesis it was originally released with, like After Burner and a couple other ones I don't quite remember.</p><p>Gunstar Super Heroes is damn awesome, so you should pick up a copy at your local Toys R Us for about $15.  Also, Gunstar Heroes is available of Wii Virtual Console for $8, which is also a damn good buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Bangai-O</b></div><p>So, that brings us to today.  By the end of the year, Treasure will release it's third remake on the DS, entitled <b>Bangai-O Spirits</b>.</p><p>Bangai-O is in a weird genre.  It's a free-roaming shmup, where you explore around the level and reach the boss at the end.  I guess, technically, it would be a side-scrolling shmup, except you fly in all directions whenever you want.  The point of Bangai-O is to make massive explosions with bombs laying around the stage and destroy as much as possible with various chains of explosions.</p><p>It was originally released for the Nintendo 64, but found a home on the Dreamcast as well..  that's the only version that was released in the states.</p><p>ugh..  I'm god awful at this game.  I really couldn't figure out how to play it, and I ended up just getting really frustrated with it..  Some people consider it to be one of Treasure's best games, but I don't really see it.</p><p><em>New Features</em>:  Unlike previous remakes, this Bangai-O Spirits looks like it adds a ton of stuff.  Multiplayer (both Co-op and versus), Map Editor, Full map on the top screen..  this actually sounds pretty badass.</p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>This all comes rather timely, as Microsoft, at their pre-TGS conference, finally officially announced that <b>Ikaruga</b> will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade next year.  Ikaruga is my favorite Treasure title, and I also deem it as Treasure's best game.. hands down.</p><p><a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html" title="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html">http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html</a></p><p>Ikaruga is a beautiful horizontal-scrolling shmup featuring the Zen of fighting light v. dark.  Enemies are of both light and dark, and you are able to combat and absorb their powers by flipping your side, back and forth, between light and dark.</p><p>Stunning game.</p><p><em>Also</em>, along side Ikaruga, <b>Rez</b>, <b>Every Extend Extra</b>, and <b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b> will also be making their way on XBLA.  Nice!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3: Biting the Bullet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the Bullet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 11, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Ever since the beginning, I've been pretty against the Xbox.  I will never own an original Xbox, mainly because all my good Xbox games are now backwards compatible, the controller is rather horrid, and the overall bias the Japanese games are far superior to American games.. definitely on consoles.</p><p>But the 360 has changed a lot of things.  It's a very robust machine that IS changing gaming, and some good games are actually beginning to appear on the console.</p><p>I've been absolutely blown away by Mass Effect, but one cannot ignore Halo 3.</p><div class='title'><b>Rationale</b></div><p>I have decided to buy Halo 3 on launch day, but main rationale behind owning/playing it, is to re-live an old past-time that Justin (my army pal) and I shared nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Back in the day, Justin and I played the living crap out of Goldeneye.  In the morning, we'd have school, and in the evening we'd meet up at our jobs at Toys R Us.  I ran the video game section there, and the manager's usually made him do crap work.</p><p>As the store came to a close, and I hid the last of my re-shop, He and I would get back to his place around 10:30pm, and end up playing versus Goldeneye until 1 or 2am on a school night.  We'd do this damn near every night, and occasionally drag other co-workers along for the ride.</p><p>Our video game days were pretty much over when he decided to join the military..</p><p>Several months ago, he picked up a 360 and have found a new love in video gaming.  He's played the crap out of most of the major releases such as Rainbox 6 Vegas, Ghost Recon, and Bioshock.  He is eagerly anticipating the release of Halo 3, so he pushes it onto me.</p><p>At this point, I was teetoring either way, but what really clenched it for me were these Best Buy midnight parties, with free stuff.  Video game events are badass, so why the hell not.  The rationale outweighs the irrationale.</p><div class='title'><b>Decisions</b></div><p>So, I'm gonna preorder Halo 3, BUT which copy do I buy?  I've got 3 to choose from.  Legendary Edition comes with 4 discs, a bunch of artbooks and a Spartan helmet all for $130...  Absolutely not.  So, really I have 2 choices: Regular Edition or Limited Edition.</p><p>Well, this is a tough decision for me.  I will always think twice, thrice, etc on whether or not to get the slightly more expensive Limited Edition versus the a stale 'ol Regular Edition.  It's collector nature for me.</p><p>My main distinction is that this is Halo.  It has already sold more than one million copies prior to its actual release.  It is going to be the most common, most played Xbox game ever.  This game will basically be worthless several weeks after release.  It's "collector" value with plomit faster than a fat guy into a buffet.</p><p>In a long enough span of time, the Limited Edition will retain more than a $10 lead on the Regular Edition.  The Regular Edition will probably be $20 around this time next year, whereas the Limited Edition will never be printed again.</p><p>BUT, is that really true?  I can still find copies of Halo 2 Limited Edition in used game stores for around $20, whereas the normal edition is $14.  The Limited Edition MAY be limited, but there are still around 500,000 copies of it floating around.  It's no where near rare.</p><p>Obviously, the collector's argument is not valid at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Value</b></div><p>Let's look at this argument from a different perspective.  Regular Edition is $60, and Limited Edition is $70.  You get raped by the inane price no matter which way you face..  So what's the difference between the 2 versions.</p><p>Regular Edition nets you Halo 3.  Limited Edition nets you Halo 3, hardcover Halo 3 artbook, Halo 3 fiction book, extra disc with "making of" features and HD calibration details, and a hardcover case that'll fit everything inside of it.  You get a ton of stuff for that extra $10.  Almost enough stuff to forget you're paying so much for the most common game you'll ever find in a year.</p><p>That's in a year though, and I've got two choices.. so the decision has been made on the Value argument.</p><div class='title'><b>Ironic</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" /></p><p>So yeah, today I picked up the preorder for Halo 3 Limited Edition at my local Best Buy, which will be having its midnight release party in 13 days.</p><p>I find it rather ironic that Halo 3 will be the first Xbox 360 or Xbox game that I'll be purchasing at full price..  Mass Effect will no longer have that honor.  Unless you count those Burger King games, which were bought at the full price of $4 each..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phoenix Wright: Release History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phoenix-wright-release-history">Phoenix Wright: Release History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I usually play about an hour or two every night, and currently I'm on the second investigation part on the third (out of four) cases.  It's kinda fun, but it certainly does not have the intensity of innovation I experience when I played the first Phoenix Wright.</p><div class='title'><b>Release History</b></div><p>Let's explore the releases of Phoenix Wright to further understand the lineage of the series.</p><p>Phoenix Wright was first released for the Nintendo DS, here in the US on October 12th, 2005; however, the DS versions of Phoenix Wright, or Gyakuten Saiban are actually remakes of the Gameboy Advance games.  Gyakuten Saiban 1 was first released 4 years prior on the same date for the GBA.</p><p><pre>10/12/01 - Gyakuten Saiban - 58,877 units sold</pre></p><p>It's release did not do so well, but that didn't stop Capcom from making a sequel.  Just one year later, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was released.  Of course, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was the exact same game, but with different music, different stories, and some new characters ^_^.  Capcom re-released the first title on the same day at a budget price to increase sales for the series overall.</p><p><pre>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 129,630 units sold<br/>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 - 176,953 units sold</pre></p><p>Which, worked fairly damn well.  All those that missed Phoenix Wright the first time around, easily picked up both titles now that the first one was a mere $30.  Capcom LOVES to make billions of sequels, so it comes to no surprise that they did the exact same thing the year after.</p><p><pre>12/19/03 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 101,388 units sold<br/>01/23/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 - 173,336 units sold</pre></p><p>Actually, after playing PW3, it's rather hard to picture it selling 173k units.  The IP seemed pretty strong.  Sure it wasn't moving a million units, but nearly 200k units is pretty good for Japan sales.</p><p>I'm not really sure what happened at this point..  But Gyakuten Saiban 4 did not follow the next year.  Perhaps something happens at the end of the third game that simply can't allow for a 4th game with Phoenix Wright..  As October came up, they released PW3 at a budget price.</p><p><pre>10/01/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 68,181 units sold</pre></p><p>But, with no new game to push sales of the old game..  it did nearly as well as the series debut.  Fall of 2004 saw a shift in Handheld gaming though..  This was the time where the Nintendo DS was released.  Capcom decided to hop on the DS craze by porting over their slight successful game series.</p><p><pre>09/15/05 - Gyakuten Saiban - 128,842 units sold<br/>10/12/05 - Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - ~100,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The 5th year of Gyakuten Saiban, brought forth the DS version of the game with slightly better graphics and a NEW DS only case after you beat the game.  Original fans of the series flocked to the new level, whereas new adopters of the series fell in love with Phoenix Wright for the first time.</p><p>Over here in the US, the game sold poorly thanks to poor marketing and very few units shipped.  It wasn't until Spring of 2006 rolled around and people had huge difficulty finding the game, that Capcom realized it was their fault for the poor sales.  They re-release the US version a couple times, while over in Japan, they released the game at a budget to pull more people into the series.</p><p><pre>06/15/06 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 149,552 unit sold</pre></p><p>Now, I don't know if the original DS release had this, but this budget release just so happened to include the full English version of the game.  Gamers in the US helped add to these sales since they could not find a US copy.  Sales were also very high due to the release of the DS Lite which happened 2 months prior.</p><p>A couple months later saw the revamp and release of the Second title.</p><p><pre>10/26/06 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 111,485 units sold<br/>01/16/07 - Phoenix Wright 2: Justice for All - 90,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The Japanese release started right off as a budget title, which makes complete sense as it lacked a DS only chapter.  The Japanese release also contained the full English version of the game, which can account for lack-luster US sales.  Die-hard US Phoenix Wright fans simply imported the game to play it months ahead of time.</p><p>Along with the Japanese release, began the promotional support for the long-awaited release of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  A new original game for the series that contained all new characters, and all chapters which used all capabilities of the DS, and in April of 2007..  fans finally got their game.</p><p><pre>04/12/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 4 - 487,000 units sold</pre></p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was hands-down, the fastest selling title of the series.  In fact, in its first week it sold more copies than any single version of a previous game.  Thanks to all these crazy previous releases, fans knew what was coming for the series.  DS chapters much like that extra chapter in the first game.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was such a success, that a few weeks later, Capcom simply blurting out that Gyakuten Saiban 5 would happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, for US fans of the series, Gyakuten Saiban 4 does not contain the English version, so we must wait for the US release, or perhaps it'll be included on its' budget release.</p><p>Anyways, just 2 weeks away, Capcom finally released Gyakuten Saiban 3, and fans of the series who missed it the first time, can finally see how Phoenix Wright's saga ends.</p><p><pre>08/23/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 77,000 (so far)</pre></p><p>Not too far off, Phoenix Wright 3 will be hitting the states.</p><p><pre>10/23/07 - Phoenix Wright 3: Trials and Tribulations</pre></p><p>Capcom is currently holding the 3rd game over the heads of us US fans of the series..  "If you want Phoenix Wright 4, you'll have to buy Phoenix Wright 3.  If sales are good, it's a go!"  Though, they are already planning on bringing it over as <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</em>.</p><p>Honestly, I cannot wait for Apollo Justice..  So much so, that i'll actually play through Phoenix Wright 3 ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Total Sales</b></div><p>So, let's tabulate all the current sales and see how the individual games actually stack up against each other.</p><p><pre>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (5 versions) - ~566,901 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Justice for All (4 versions) - ~479,826 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations (3 versions) - 318,517 japan only, so far<br/>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (1 version) - 487,000 japan only</pre></p><p>I'd imagine sales for Apollo Justice eventually overtaking the original game, no problem.</p><p><b><i>Update:</i></b> By the way, I should really mention that I acquired this data from Cubed3 who found it from the Neo-GAF post I originally saw it in, which happens to be 4 months out of date, and also from vgchartz.com which is almost never accurate.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dangerous Knowledge" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dangerous-knowledge">Dangerous Knowledge</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I came across this amazing documentary entitled: Dangerous Knowledge.  It's been passed around the internet quite a bit, so there's a possibility you may have seen it pop up since it's debut yesterday.  The website, Best Free Documentaries, has got it right here:</p><p><a href="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html" title="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html">http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html</a></p><p>Dangerous Knowledge is about 4 amazing mathematicians who descended into madness trying to solve some impossible questions..</p><div class='title'><b>Georg Canter</b></div><p>Canter, a German mathematician, is the first subject of this documentary born 1845 died 1918.  His birth of madness began with trying to understand the infinite.  He could not accept that one infinite space is equal to another infinite space..</p><p>for example: a 1 by 1 square contains an infinite amount of points.  well, a 2 by 1 square also contains an infinite amount of points.  Through Mathematics, both infinities are equal.  Well this can't be!  The 2 by 1 square has twice the area as the 1 by 1 square.  Surely the infinite space of the 2 by 1 is at least twice the size as the 1 by 1 square.  But Mathematics says No!  It's the same.</p><p>Logically this makes no sense, so Canter sought to proves that there are an infinite amount of infinities, which became known as Canter's Theorem.  Well..  doing so totally unraveled the thought of mathematics.  Simple things became untrue.  This doesn't make any sense either..  So he began working at it the other way..  Since these simple basics of mathematics are true, then they shall disprove his infinite infinites..  Well he found out to also be impossible.</p><p>Day by Day he worked on this until his son died..  and with his son's death, he lost a part of himself.  He killed himself because of what he lost because of his failure to prove or disprove his theorem.  There's also some religious mumbo-jumbo in there too.</p><div class='title'><b>Ludwig Boltzmann</b></div><p>Boltzmann is our second case and lived in the same time frame, born 1844 died 1906.  Boltzmann was physicist and hypothesized that time is irreversible.  Time is not something that can be defined on two way plane, it is an ever-driving forward concept that can never be stopped.</p><p>Today, we already know this.  In fact, this is what modern physics is based on today.  Boltzmann, unfortunately, discovered this fact 20 years too early, before later physicists adopted the truth.  But because he lived in a time of unquestionable obedience to world leaders, such a massive concept was utterly opposed because of what it implicated.</p><p>The severe oppositions to Boltzmann's discovery drove him into a deep depression that he escaped when he committed suicide.</p><p>The final two cases are of <b>Kurt Godel</b> and <b>Alan Turing</b>, who both saw Canter's work, believed to have understood it, and began to solve it in their own ways.  Both men were born around the times of the Boltzmann's and Canter's deaths.</p><div class='title'><b>Kurt Godel</b></div><p>Godel was an Austrian mathematician who fell into the same madness that Canter had suffered from, but began looking at the problem a little differently.  Through trying to understand why infinite was undefinable, he began to understand certainty and completeness.  He set forth to define these abstract topics..</p><div class='title'><b>Alan Turing</b></div><p>Out of these 4, Alan Turing is the most I was familiar with prior to the film.  Alan Turing is particularly famous in the field of Artificial Intelligence and modern Computer Science as well.  He figured that if this theorem was actually solvable then a Computer could surely figure it out.</p><div class='title'><b>The Halting Problem</b></div><p>This where Turing had developed one of his most famous Theorems: the halting problem.  The basic thought of the theorem is how do you tell if a problem is unsolvable..  In AI class back in Platteville, Professor Hasker put this problem in terms of finding infinite loops in your code.  Is there ever a way to determine whether your program is stuck in an infinite loop, or does it just take a really long time to run?  How do you determine this way code?<br/><pre><br/><pre>//paraphrased from old notes from Hasker's class<br/>//http://www.uwplatt.edu/csse/courses/prev/s07/cs303/notes/303n01.html</p><p>public void work(String input)<br/>{<br/><span/>   if( terminatesOnInput(input) )<br/><span/>   {<br/><span/>      //statement #1<br/><span/>      sysout("Program can operate on passed input");<br/><span/>   }<br/><span/>   else<br/><span/>   {<br/><span/>      //statement #2<br/><span/>      sysout("Program is caught in an infinite loop while processing input");<br/><span/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/></pre><br/>There no possible way statement #2 will ever be called, because the terminatesOnInput will be stuck in an infinite loop, BUT how do we know that the input passed is such that it just takes a while.  Are you going to wait a week to see if the input takes a week to process?  Or is it just unsolvable?</p><p>In the real world, if something takes more than a minute or two, there's something wrong..  but in the research field, in philosophy and mathematics, how long is too long?</p><div class='title'><b>Turing's madness</b></div><p>How could you not go crazy thinking about this?  Turing began to think of Canter's continuum theorem as the difference between humans and machines.  Machines are irrefutable logic devices which can solve anything, so us, as humans, most possess an extra attribute beyond the capacity of a computer to go above and beyond.  He thought of this as our intuition, but he figured that machines had the capability to intuitively seek out answers and grow..</p><p>He absorbed himself so much in this problem that he could not tell the difference between Human and Machine.  What was it to be human, and how could this NOT be replicated with machine..</p><p>Anywho, to Turing's defense, foundationally it wasn't the halting problem or the continuum theorem that ultimately led to his death.  He was homosexual, in a time when homosexuality was a mental deficiency.  He was very open about it as well, which didn't take too long for "concerned" citizens to commit him to an insane asylum.</p><p>The treatment for homosexuality was pumping him full of estrogen, which doesn't make any sense at all early-mid 1900 doctors.  Turing began to grow breasts and other womanly features..  Turing began to contradict himself as he contradicted humanity..  and killed himself as a result of overwhelming uncertainty.</p><div class='title'><b>Check it out</b></div><p>Pretty crazy stuff, eh?  Definitely check out the full hour and a half commercial free presentation linked above at <a href="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html" title="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html">Best Free Documentaries</a>.  Well worth the watch or listen to.  Especially since they refer to Math as Maths.</p><p>I should really check out more mathematics documentaries..  That one we watched for Math History about Fermat's Last Theorem was an equally interesting watch.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Migrations" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/migrations">Migrations</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings all, today is Labor Day, which is a paid vacation day at my place of business.  So instead of going into the office I can do whatever I want.  Funny that, I ended up spending close to 6 hours both finishing up that poorly written Metroid Prime and migrating all my Movable Type journal entries to this Wordpress blog.</p><p>The main bulk of that time was cutting out the 24,000 comments from prescription drug companies, magazine, and pornographic websites.  After toying around, they were all posted on one article, so cutting them out was pretty easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Exporting Movable Type into Wordpress</b></div><p>Movable Type's exporting is quite amazing, by the way.  It dumps all the articles into a text file   They have a bizzare format, but it's still pretty readable:<br/><pre>--------<br/>AUTHOR: dyre<br/>TITLE: stuff?<br/>STATUS: Draft<br/>ALLOW COMMENTS: 0<br/>CONVERT BREAKS: __default__<br/>ALLOW PINGS: 0<br/>PRIMARY CATEGORY: daily<br/>CATEGORY: daily</p><p>DATE: 10/09/2003 08:43:39 AM<br/>-----<br/>BODY:<br/>omitted boring emotional text.<br/>-----<br/>EXTENDED BODY:</p><p>-----<br/>EXCERPT:</p><p>-----<br/>KEYWORDS:</p><p>-----</pre><br/><pre><br/>--------</pre><br/>Even though Wordpress is an annoying piece of crap, it has a convient "import from Movable Type" feature, which is very helpful.  So Importing all these old entries really only took 5 minutes.  200 more articles in 5 whole minutes..  not bad.</p><div class='title'><b>Upkeep on old stale articles</b></div><p>Despite my best judgement, I decided not to cut out content related to my life at the time, so there's plenty of school related articles talking about how lazy I can be, what classes I was attending, what homework I need to do and also several articles talking about my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>All those personal articles really tappered off when broke up with her and took a 9 or 10 month break from the internet, so around April 2004 my articles became more about the subject I was writting about and less about what I did that weekend or how I felt about the crushing stress of finishing off a semester at Platteville.  Paints an emotional picture doesn't it?</p><p>To fit all these new articles, I added a couple new categories, and also organized them into sub-groups.  I also made an <b>Opinion</b> category for all my reviews, gamelogs, and impressions about various Games, Moves, Music Events and such.</p><div class='title'><b>Still more</b></div><p>There are still plenty of articles that predate installing Movable Type that I haven't gathered up, but I could easily make a program that would convert all those entries into a Movable Type backup file, and have Wordpress import them.  Handy!</p><p>Many of these are very old reviews, but are still pretty funny..  like my Treasure Planet review, Kingdom Hearts review, and Magnolia review..  Now that I finished up Metroid, maybe that's what I'll work on.</p><div class='title'><b>Bored?</b></div><p>Well, if you're really bored, feel free to go back in time and read all those articles.  It's not like these haven't already been on the internet over at <a href="/old/v7/journal" title="/journal">theschlock.com/journal</a>, so you don't really gain anything new from reading them, unless you haven't read them.  You'd probably want to use the Search engine and category trees to your advantage to finding the better articles though.</p><p>Some of my old reviews are kinda funny at least.  especially my timely <a href="/old/v7/metriod-prime-2-impressions" title="/metriod-prime-2-impressions">Metroid Prime 2 review</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>ADVICE</b></div><p>by the way, NEVER use wordpress's entry edited for writing your blog posts.  Wordpress uses some funky CSS and Javascript to make your articles look like they do after you submit them.  BUT because of this, the text field is not longer a trackable DOM field.  SO when you submit an article, the text is immediately whisked away to the HTTP request and the field is blanked out.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means if you end up getting any browser errors, domain errors.. basically any error at all: <b><em>You lose your entire post!</em></b>  I've had this happen to me enough, that I don't even use the editor unless I'm actually edited an entry.</p><p>I use Wordpad to actually write out all my entries, and then I just copy and paste them into the editor, hit save, and then hit publish.</p><p>I'm currently using Wordpress 2.0.4, so maybe they've fixed it, but I'm not taking any chances anymore.  Especially when Firefox is somewhat buggy too and can crash at will.</p><p>Something to think about anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-full-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 2, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Getting into Metroid Prime 3 was very easy for me.  I've been waiting for a game on the Wii that I could tear apart and dive into without hestitation.  Metroid is that game.</p><p>It's very odd though.. What do I like about Metroid Prime 3?  My overall feelings towards the game are very numb and complacent.  There are so many mediocre points in the game, but are easily looking over while playing the game.</p><div class='title'><b><em>By the way..  this review will continue mountains of spoilers, so please don't read on if you don't wish to be spoiled</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Playing the game..</b></div><p>Playing this game is a dream.  I absolutely love the gameplay.  Honestly, I can see why people are so ape shit about the gameplay and say stupid things like, "This is the best console fps experience you'll ever have."  That's a bold statement, but I think I would agree that the controls are spot on.  Overall, I do prefer this over dual analog sticks.  You get FAR more control and precision shooting things with the Wii-mote.  A little joystick cannot compare to the Wii-mote at all.</p><p>This is how you make a Wii game.  This is how you make full use of the Wii-mote and motion controls with over burdening your gamer.  The little subtle actions of showing off the motion controls are great because they only happen when you're completely focused are flipping a switch, turning screw controls, or pulling out energy containers.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviewing this game..</b></div><p>It's because of this beautiful gameplay that everyone loves the game.  It's the same reason I love it.  So many publications give this game a 10 or a 9.5 simply because of this, but I don't know why they didn't grade the game harsher on its fall backs.  The gameplay is like that genius student in your class that makes up for all the others students getting Cs.  The gameplay is that one cop that goes out on a limb to solve the case in the most elaborate and thorough way (like John Mcclain), while everything else in the game simply plays it straight and safe.</p><p>There's so much mediocrity in this game that is overshadowed by the gameplay that just isn't getting press, but with good reason.  In good conscience can reviewers really just gloss over everything else because it is blantly bad and give it a perfect 10 based on gameplay alone?</p><p>It's weird..  I'm not dissapointed with the game, and I think they did a fantastic job with it too.  Here..  I'll just tell you what I think about it..</p><div class='title'><b>The Music..</b></div><p>The music in Metroid Prime 3 is absolutely bland.  They overuse that organic flange like it was pop rocks in the 80s.  The music is so uninspired, so subtle...  but it doesn't get in your way.  The music doesn't push the environment on you; it's just there to create an ambiance, but doesn't fit with the environment at all.  It reminds me of Doom for some reason, but far more low key.</p><p>The background music does feel very Metroid, but it doesn't feel alien at all.  More mission driven and pumping.</p><p>However, this is completely overruled by One track in the game that had me blown away.  Put me in a state of awe.  That one track I was waiting for the entire game to blow me away.  The Ice level has absolutely beautiful background music.  Fluttering high-note piano music raining snow onto the land, the fields, the statues, and me in the middle of it.</p><p>This was the first point in teh game that I actually stopped for a moment and took it in.  Listened to the beautiful orchestrated notes take me to this place, much like it did back in Metroid Prime 1 with Phendrana..  the Ice planet.  That's kinda weird isn't it?  How can the best two tracks in the Metroid Prime series both be from Ice worlds.  They should make christmas music or something..  Metroid Prime 4: Lost in the Ice Kingdom would probably be the best videogame OST in the history of gaming.</p><p>But that's it.  I went through the Ice world, collected the Screw Attack, and left..  That was it for the entire fricken game..  The only other track that comes close is the menu music..  That's somewhat decent.</p><p>It's rather funny that the quality of Music forms and equal parallel to game overall.  There's one piece of music that keeps you from counting out the music all together.</p><div class='title'><b>The Environments..</b></div><p>This is the first Metroid where you aren't on One planet the whole game.  Overall, you have 5 major planets and a few other places consisting of at least a dozen unique areas of exploration.  Actually, the more I think about it, the diversity within a planet really tells the story of civilization on that planet.  The 5 planets you explore are Norion, Bryyo, Elysia, Pirate Homeworld and Phaze, though I suppose Phaze really doesn't count.</p><p>The environments you encounter through the game are pretty standard.  You walk around on a battle cruiser like in a Halo 2, go through a federation outpost which is pretty standard.  Metroid begins very federation oriented which is unlike any other Metroid and everything like most space opera sci-fi.  Once you finally break free of the federation and begin exploring, you start to encounter actual alien worlds.</p><p>The first alien world is Bryyo and is also the most under developed of the planets.  It's quite interesting that because it's the most under developed, it is also the most varied in enviroments.  You do come across a pirate outpost, but it is thick within the jungle.  On the side of the planet, you have the firey volcanos.  Within the fire pits, you come across a warp point to the Ice caverns.  On this one planet, you have complete polar opposites, somewhat like Earth.</p><p>Because of the varied environments you have all kinds of plant, animal and sentient life, which doesn't make sense why it's the most boring planet of them all.  Hurray i'm in a Jungle.. Hurrah I'm in a volcano.  Hurrah i'm in an ice cavern (but the music is beautiful).  Don't get me wrong, they all look quite good, but don't go that extra mile to really WOW me.  All these environments have already been done in Metroid Prime 1.</p><p>Elysia.  Now HERE is a planet that made me stop and just look around at everything.  Elysia is a lot like Jupiter, a gasious liquid planet that nothing can live on, unless you were in the upper atmosphere away from the violent death storms.  You walk around on a settlement built in the sky which is completely built on <em>Steam</em>.  Oh baby..   A Steampunk planet..  fucking brilliant.</p><p>All the little robots are steam powered.  When you walk around, they are little repair bots working on the station to keep it running and working.  The enemy robots are straight out of 50s scifi.  A very hostile andriod looking robot firing ring beams at you.  I love Elysia, but what really annoyed me was everywhere you went was the same.  You didn't have a multiple varied environments like you did back on Bryyo.</p><p>After Elysia, you go to the Pirate Homeworld was is more standard technology type stuff.  It kinda reminds me of the Borg homeworld and to finish off the game you go to planet Phaze which is beautiful, but pretty standard stuff at this point after going into the Leviathan ships.</p><p>One other spiffy place you can go is optional and it is the remenants of a battle between Federation and Pirates which was over-swarmed by Metroids.  This is my absolute favorite point in the game because you are investigating what actually happened to this federation ship and uncovering clues to the actual menance that awaits you at the end of the game.</p><p>Because this area is optional, you need to find Energy Cells throughout the game to repower doors, ramps and elevators in this deserted graveyard.  There needed to be MUCH MUCH more of this, rather than just chasing around pirates.  Focus the game on METROIDS, not the stupid pirate conspiracies involving metroids.  Use your graphically power to show off how deadly the metroid race is, rather than some submissive controlled species.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroids..</b></div><p>Hey guess what.. let's talk about how under utilized Metroids are in Metroid Prime 3.  How do you kill a Metroid?  This is video game survival 101.  You freeze it, and fire 5 missiles at it which will shatter the monster.  That's pretty much what you do in Metroid Prime 3, however you also kill a Metroid through hypermode or a sniped headshot, which makes it way to easy.</p><p>The whole point of fighting a Metroid is to feel like you are David versus Goliath.  Metroids are ruthless, energy sucking parasites which will devour every ounce of strength you have.  Metroid Prime 3 portreys the Metroid species just as any other creatures in the game.  Just another enemy in your way.  In fact, there are more menancing creatures in the game than Metroids.</p><p>The only scene that came close to showing off Metroid brutality was one Metroid dragging a federation soldiers corpse through a hallway.</p><p>There needs to be a scene, NOT a cutscene, where a bunch of Metroids break free and run rampant through a planet, chewing on the nearby animals, all while you are fending them off and trying to get away before falling victim.  Metroids are basically higher level alien zombies..  Why not feed on the anxiety and suspense of a zombie attack in a Metroid game?</p><p>You'd be fucked if you came up against 3 Metroids.. but not in Metroid Prime 3.  blam blam.. they're dead, you're safe.  bullshit.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story..</b></div><p>Besides that, the story is still rather lacking.  You basically go through space, fighting off pirate advances and learn of the growing menance of Phazon.  All while, the phazon inside of you is growing and slowly taking over.</p><p>Being slowly corrupted is a great plot device, but means nothing when your character doesn't talk or give any emotional indication of being corrupted.  Samus is basically a robot inside of her armor suit.  This is one of things I noticed right away after killing one of her friends in the beginning.  She is emotionally disconnected with the story, which makes it really hard to play a character driven game.</p><p>HOWEVER..  This special ending finally brings emotion into Samus..  It's really a shame that you have to get 75% complete in order to view this ending, because this IS the emotion missing from the game.  Samus lands on Elysia, takes off her helmet and looks into the clouds.  She stares saddenly into the distance and thinks about her friends, their corruption into madness, and her duty to put them down..  It's very powerful, though has crappy music that could have made it more powerful.</p><p>The super special ending after getting 100% complete continues from there.  She walks back to her ship, takes off the rest of her suit, and then goes into space.  After flying into the distance, another ship rises from the surface as well, and follows her.  OMG sequel!</p><div class='title'><b>blah blah blah..</b></div><p>To sum it up, Metroid Prime 3 is pretty slick.  It is a great example of how game developers need to utilize the Wii-mote's abilities to the fullest.  Definitely play this game.  <em>This is the best game on the Wii right now.</em></p><p>As you can see from all the text above, I don't really feel overly amazed by the game, but it definitely doesn't suck.  There's a ton of potential that didn't follow through, but it is a joy to play and is very solid too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Concurrency in Java" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/concurrency-in-java">Concurrency in Java</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hey everyone.  These past few days, I've been doing a lot of work making some of our processors concurrently work on things.  Concurrency is the idea of having your program do many things at once, rather than linearly.  The major positive of doing this is a sharp performance gain.  For example, if you have 10 tasks that take 1 minute each to accomplish.  If you have one person do all these tasks it'll take 10 minutes.  If you have 10 equal people do one each, it'll take 1 minute to do all the work.  Pretty basic concept.</p><p>What's not so basic is how to go about implementing this in your code.  Let's say you have a function that does your work to complete this task:<br/><pre>public void doWork()<br/>{<br/>   ...<br/>}</pre><br/>and you have some Manager Class that is continuously running, looking for something to do.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         doWork();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>where acquireWork() will return null if there's no work to do.  Pretty standard operations.  You give this thing 10 1 minute tasks, it'll take 10 minutes to do them.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's use Threading!</b></div><p>Let's split some of this stuff up and use Threading.  Threads will spawn a new process that works aside from your current program.  When you start up a Thread, your main process will go on its merry way and let the thread do all the work.</p><p>To make a process run on a thread, you need your class to implement Runnable, and put all your work in the run() method you must implement..  So, let's do that with our doWork method.<br/><pre>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>now, back in our while(true) loop, we can spin off threads to do all the work, rather than getting holding up processor time doing all the work ourselves.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         new Thread(new WorkerThread(work)).start();<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>the start() method will spin off your thread, while your main processor goes back to find more work for threads to do.  You give this thing 10 1 minutes tasks, it'll take around a minute for all those tasks to complete, but it'll take virtually no time for the main processor.</p><p><b>Note!</b> Do not use threads when your task operates on an overall chunk of data.  You want to give threads task that can be done completely independent of each other.</p><p>Not bad eh?  You've got the thing running smokin' fast..  Almost too fast though..  what happens when you get 100 tasks, or 1000 tasks.. or 1,000,000 tasks?!  You're going to run out of resources very fast, and eventually your program will probably throw some Out Of Memory Exceptions.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's not use Threading</b></div><p>You need to manage this stuff so it doesn't <em>spin</em> out of control.  That's where Executors come into play.  Executors manage all of your threads in a thread pool.  The main class you want to use is the ThreadPoolExecutor which has severals parameters in its constructor.  You specify how big your pool is, which type of waiting queue to use, how long to hold onto created threads, and, optionally, can specify a saturation policy.</p><p>It's quite customizable, so it can be confusing at first.  The Executors class is comprized of static methods with commonly used, pre-built ThreadPoolExecutors for ya.</p><p>There's the fixed pool executor, which will hold onto a specific amount of threads and when all those threads are busy it'll queue up the extras.  This is the perfect way to throttle the amount of work going on at once.  Say you have 10 1 minute tasks, but want only 5 people to work on them (budget reasons, probably).  When you get these 10 tasks at once, all 5 will work on the first 5 and when they finish them, they'll grab the next one in the queue.  If you get 1000 tasks, 995 of 'em will go straight to the queue.</p><p>There's also a cached pool executor, which will grow will the work.  It'll create new threads when there's a ton of work, but once things die down, it'll start giving back the resources to keep these threads alive.  meh..  There's not much difference in using a cached pool than starting up all the threads yourself.</p><p>Even though, the fixed pool bottles necks a lot of the work, it'll save system resources and prevent the program from running out of memory.</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ExecutorService exec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>It looks pretty indentical to the previous code.  Now it'll take about 2 minutes to go through those 10 1 minute tasks, but the program won't die when it gets 1,000,000 tasks.</p><div class='title'><b>Customizing the Executor</b></div><p>We can do better than this.</p><p>The workers are happy with their tasks, but the main process is going crazy.  Every little task that comes along will be taken right away and throw in the queue for the workers.  That's not too bad, unless you're doing some sort of transaction service.  If you open up a Transaction everytime you acquireWork, then you'll have 1,000 open transaction waiting to be processed sitting in the queue.</p><p>You could do away with the waiting pool completely, and never have an open task sitting in the queue.  This isn't such a bad idea, but what do you when all your threads are busy, and you give a new task to the executor?  You need a Saturation policy that will tell the executor what to do in this case.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturation Policies</b></div><p>By default, the Executor uses the Abort Policy, which just throws an exception.  Well, we probably don't want to do that.  There are two other ones that are available that aren't so great either:  DiscardPolicy, which will discard the new task, and DiscardOldestPolicy, which will discard the oldest piece of work that a thread is working on.  You defintely don't want to lose work, so discarding is out.  (and) Discarding the oldest piece of work?  You'd get into a cycle of constantly throwing away half worked on tasks.  Nothing would get done except the last remaining pieces of work.</p><p>If we're going to use a saturation policy, then we should use the Caller Runs policy, which uses the main process to execute the newest task when all threads are busy.  Then by the time the main processor finishes a task, the other threads should be ready to receive more work..  hell if not, the main processor can do the next one too.</p><p>This works out pretty well, since when times are busy everyone is jumping in to do the work.  The manager actually lend a helping hand ^_^.</p><p>There's one big problem with this though.  What happens when you have variable task lengths, and the manager ends up getting one that takes far longer to complete than normal?  Everything is held up by that one task, and your performance dips very quickly.  You should really only use this when you have tasks of predictable uniform completion time.</p><p>All of our tasks take 1 minute to complete, so using a Caller Runs policy should be fine.</p><p>I should note that the static Executors method return an ExecutorService, not a ThreadPoolExecutor, which actually have the setRejectionHandler that you use to set the saturation policy.  So you'll need to work around a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>This is pretty good except for one problem..  When you get six pieces of work, the 5 worker threads will get their work and the manager will work on the 6th.  Before the manager finishes task #6, all 5 workers will have finished their tasks, and now must wait for the manager to finish before they can get anything new.  Now you're wasting time again.</p><p>You can solve this by going back and using the waiting queue.  If you have your waiting queue the same size as your thread pool, then in that time when those workers finish their first piece of work, they'll have something new to work on right away.  When the manager finishes up his piece of work, the queue should be empty and ready to receive more work.  Very streamlined.</p><p>Now you'll need to actually make your own ThreadPoolExecutor, rather than using the pre-built one.  I start off by just copying the code from the Executors class and tweaking it a little bit.<br/><pre>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec =  new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 5,<br/>              0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,<br/>              new LinkedBlockingQueue(5));<br/>   exec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>The LinkedBlockQueue is your waiting pool, and you must set the size in its constructor.I suppose one problem with this setup is.. What if you get 6 tasks, and then another 5 tasks a few seconds later?  Then, by the time the manager finishes up with task #6, the 5 workers will already been done and waiting for work.  Maybe this isn't the best implementation afterall..</p><p>but if you're working with a steady workflow and uniformally timed tasks..  you'll be fine.</p><div class='title'><b>Semaphores</b></div><p>Let's do something else..  Let's not use the Caller Runs policy, and let the manager just manage the workflow.  Instead of having the manager grabbing an extra task that can't be performed on because everyone is busy, we can halt the process until something is available by using a Semaphore.</p><p>A semaphore will have a certain amount of tickets that is acquired by using semaphore.acquire().  If you only give the Semaphore 10 tickets to hand out, you can only run semaphore.acquire() 10 times.  On the 11th time, semaphore.acquire() will wait for a ticket to be returned.  You return tickets be running semaphore.release().</p><p>Implementing this is pretty simple.  We want our ticket taker before any processing, and then the threads must return the tickets when they're done with their task.<br/><pre>private Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10);</p><p>public void process()<br/>{<br/>   ThreadPoolExecutor exec = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);<br/>   while(true)<br/>   {<br/>      semaphore.acquire();<br/>      Object work = acquireWork();<br/>      if(work != null)<br/>      {<br/>         exec.execute(new WorkerThread(work, this));<br/>      }<br/>   }<br/>}</p><p>public void releaseSemaphore()<br/>{<br/>   semaphore.release();<br/>}</p><p>public class WorkerThread implement Runnable<br/>{<br/>   private Object work;<br/>   private Manager manager;</p><p>   public WorkerThread(Object work, Manager manager)<br/>   {<br/>      this.work = work;<br/>      this.manager = manager;<br/>   }</p><p>   public void run()<br/>   {<br/>      doWork();<br/>      manager.releaseSemaphor();<br/>   }</p><p>   public void doWork()<br/>   {<br/>      ...<br/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/>Now the manager isn't constantly grabbing tasks when everyone is busy.  The semaphore will let him know when there's space free for a new task.  We don't need to setup a saturation policy, nor a waiting pool size, because with 5 worker threads and 10 tickets, the waiting queue will never exceed 5 tasks.</p><p>This seems like it would work pretty good in all situation.  The main processor isn't held up by anything, the worker threads will always have some work to do.</p><p>Not too shabby..</p><div class='title'><b>Fine-Tuning the Thread Pool</b></div><p>You can still get your processing power performance up just a little bit.  When a thread pool gets a task, it doesn't simply run Thread.start on it.  The task immediately goes into your blocking queue, and threads will take the task out of there to work on.  You have 3 basic types of Block Queues to use.</p><p>The LinkedBlockQueue I've found to be the slowest.  It uses your typical LinkedList setup.  The ArrayBlockingQueue runs faster, by using an Array.</p><p>If you don't plan on having any sort of waiting pool, you should definitely use the SynchronousQueue, which doesn't hold on to your tasks at all.  It passes them to a worker thread right away, without delay.</p><div class='title'><b>There you have it</b></div><p>There you have it..  running concurrent processes will provide you a decent performance gain, but make sure you manage them properly, or else you may be in trouble.</p><p>Never use Thread().start..  Use Executors instead.</p><p>The information was learning through reading the book Java: Concurrency in Practice, written by Brain Goetz with Tim Peierls, Joshua Block, Joseph Bowbeer, Dave Holmes, and Doug Lea.  Definitely check it out for more information of concurrency ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-first-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, the Wii finally got its first big release that wasn't a ported game from another console..  Metroid Prime 3 is out in stores, though you might have some difficultly locating it.  I traded in Big Brain Academy and Rayman Raving Rabbits to Gamestop for a full-price reserve a month or two ago, so i was set.  Also, when I went to pick it up today, I put in a reserve for Mass Effect. ^_^</p><p>I could hardly wait to play this game today.  Don't get me wrong, learning about concurrency and thread-safety, while implementing processes for work is rather interesting..  but it can't really compare against shooting things with the Wii-mote..  or can it?</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin...</b></div><p>As you wake up from Cryostasis, you are inside your spaceship.  You can look around, push buttons, but eventually have to open communications with the Starfleet, rendezvous with them, and speak with the admiral.  It's a very non-game moment where you're in character, much like the beginning of Half-life or Halo.  Once aboard the ship, you can walk around and talk with people.  Of course, you don't talk back..  you're a Nintendo Character, after all.</p><p>The gameplay is pretty fluid, but does take a little getting used to.  The biggest hurdle I've been trying to get over is that the Z button holds your view, rather than the B button, as it is in Resident Evil 4.  The B Button in Metroid is jump.  So when ever I try to fire at something, I end up jumping around first before actually locking on to them.  :slaps forehead:</p><p>As soon as I began walking around, Tony said that everyone online recommends switching your look to "advanced" rather than the defaulted "normal".  Thank you Tony/Internet.  Normal and Advanced are basically degrees of when your view will move with where you point the cursor.  In Normal you have to point near the edge of the screen before your viewpoint actually turns in that direction.  With Advanced, your viewpoint will always turn when the cursor isn't in the middle of the screen.  It will turn to the degree with respect to how far away your cursor is from the middle.  It feels much more natural.</p><p>There's also other neat little Wii-mote movements, like turning key-locks, pumping other locks, and swinging the nunchuck around to use the grapple-beam..  Everything is quite intuitive ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting into it..</b></div><p>There really hasn't been much of a story yet..  Space Pirates attack, you repel them..  You get infected by Plasma or whatever it's called..  You investigate other stuff..</p><p>The story telling style is rather awkwardly paced.  In some cases, you have full dialogue of your mission objectives and what is actually happening around you.  But in other instances, when you're on the planet fighting, the gameplay is directing the story..</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b>: At the beginning you have a bunch of your Bounty Hunter buddies, that help you fight off the space pirates.  Later, after you've all been infected, you search a planet where one of them had been last seen.  You end up fighting one of your pals after he's been completely corrupted, but NOT once do you ever show remorse for his situation, nor when you kill him.. </em></p><p><em>Metroid Prime 3 feels very disconnected emotionally because of this..  If Samus doesn't care about killing one of her friends, how am I supposed to feel any compassion towards her.  I don't see this motif changing..</em></p><div class='title'><b>Achievements..</b></div><p>Something pretty slick Metroid has adopted, is the notion of achievements..  and they take many different forms.  You get a little achievement when you scan a monster (red coins), when you scan some lore (blue coins), when you defeat a boss (yellow coins), and other little random ones (tags).  There's also green coins, which I haven't figured out how to get.</p><p>All the coins you acquire can be traded in for unlockables: Concept Art, Background music, and, my favorite, stuff for your car (spaceship).  You can get bumperstickers for your spaceship.  You can get Bobblehead figurines for your dashboards.  All kinds of stupid crap.  Most of them require green coins, though :/</p><p>The tags, on the other hand, work with your friends list.  I've gotten tags for killing 100 enemies, killing 200 enemies, and 2 other things which I can't recall.  You can use these tags to send a friend voucher to someone on your list.  I sent one to Erika and Dave..  What do they do?!</p><div class='title'><b>The Atmosphere..</b></div><p>One of the things I did love in Metroid Prime 1, was the music..  ESPECIALLY Phendrana, the Ice level.  The music was absolutely ambient, subtle, and atmospheric.  I just wanted to sit back and take it in..  So far, Metroid Prime 3's music has been sub-par to ass.  Honestly, it's so un-memorable, I can't even remember what it sounds like when I try to recall it.</p><p>Music in a game is pretty important for me..  It'll make a mediocre game memorable, and a fantastic game boring, for me.  All of my all-time favorite games have very much to do with having an excellent soundtrack.  So when a game is somewhat boring enough for me to notice that the music is pretty stupid, there's a problem.</p><p>I'm pretty disappointed by this, but there is FAR more game left to surprise.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I'm at..</b></div><p>After I finally exited out of Metroid Prime 3, my time was 4 hours.  I'm at 12% complete of the game, too.  I'm guessing I'll probably finish the game around 20 or 25 hours.  Remember, the percentage is the total amount of stuff done in the game, not your progression through the story.</p><p>Despite being disappointed by a couple things, I am having fun with it..  I can't wait to see what happens when we start getting into rogue Aurora Units and Metroid conspiracies..  I'll definitely be disappointed if neither of those two things happen.</p><p>Right now, there seems to be a lot going on..  So that's good ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/62">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/60">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
