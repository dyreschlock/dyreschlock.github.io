We are pretty deprived in America when it comes to deep cultural architectural artifacts as our nation's history is a mere 200 years old. While the Japanese people have been on that island ever since it disconnected itself from main Asia. Also, Japanese Castles wildly interest me as they're usually nestled into modern society.</p><p>Anyway, on our trip, <b>exactly one year ago</b>, Dave and I had the fortune of visiting two of Kyushu's standing castles: Kumamoto and Shimbara.  After our visit to Kagoshima in southern Kyushu, we traveled north on our way to Nagasaki.  As a waypoint, we stopped at Kumamoto for a night.  In the morning, we head took a ferry across the Shimabara sea to Shimabara, and ultimately Nagasaki.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto Castle</b></div><p>Unfortunately, we left Kagoshima much later than expected, and arrived in Kumamoto around 4pm.  We got to our hotel, checked in, and made our way to Kumamoto Castle.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp"  /></p><p>We arrived at Kumamoto Castle a bit after 5pm, and had less than an hour to explore this marvel.  So, we ran around the castle, and made our way to the top as fast as we could.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Here's a panoramic photo from the top: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7725_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7725_stitch.webp">Image!</a></p><p>It was a very pretty castle, and it's grounds were rather large, but we only had time to visit the castle itself.  We had barely gotten there, and had to leave already.  For the rest of the night we got some dinner, and went shopping for games and other things.  That story is detailed here: <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">Games I Buy: DDR Edition</a></p><div class='title'><b>Shimabara Castle</b></div><p>In the morning, we made way to Kumamoto Port, and sailed across the Shimabara Sea to Nagasaki Prefecture.  It was somewhat foggy out that day.  It felt like we were sailing into the unknown.  We left the port behind, and eventually it faded away into the gray void.</p><p>Dave and I basically relaxed on our voyage.  I don't really remember doing anything special.  Eventually, land started coming into view from a far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp"  /></p><p>It was the port of Shimabara, totalled overshadowed by Mt. Fugen.  Mt. Fugen and the Unzen resort nearby was our first field trip when studying abroad.  We spent the day climbing to the top, which gave a great view of the volcano festering along side it.  Here's pictures from back then: <a href="/old/v7/i-climbed-another-mountain" title="/i-climbed-another-mountain">Images!</a></p><p>Anyway, our ferry sailed parallel to the harbor for a while and finally docked.  Dave and I exited the craft and walked to the nearest train station.  20 minutes later our train arrived, and we got off at the castle grounds.  We walked up the hill, and were met with the icon of Shimabara.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7808_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7808_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7808_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7826.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7826.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7827.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7827.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7827.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7907.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7910.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7910.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7910.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7916.webp"  /></p><p>We went inside, and climbed the stairs to the top.

One weekend when studying abroad, a fellow JASIN student, Brian, and I took a Saturday and rode the train out here.  The castle hadn't changed one bit in the last 4 years.  The entire compound was basically trapped in time.  It suffered no degredation due to the upkeep of its staff.  Likewise, it had not evolved or iterated in its years either.  It was a relic frozen in time.  Which makes sense...  It's a historic monument.  They aren't going to build any new wings of the fortress.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto v. Shimabara</b></div><p>The difference between Kumamoto and Shimabara are quite clear.  First off, Kumamoto is the capitol of Kumamoto Prefecture.  It's an actual city, rather than a rural village.  It's the center of all of Kyushu, and has thousands of people through its area everyday.  It has more cash flowing through it, therefore it's castle is more expansive, complex, and vast.</p><p>Shimbara is a simple town with a simple castle.  It has a single structural point that continues to the sky, rather than multiple wings.  The compound has several buildings, but it's mostly towers and keeps, rather than offices and barracks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: DDR edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">Games I buy: DDR edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As a game collector, you eventually come across a game that you simply cannot find.  A game that's not necessary rare, but uncommon.  The only distinction between the two being demand.  This particular game for me is (was) Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.</p><p>DDR Party Collection was released in Dec 2003 as a follow-up and compliment to DDR Extreme.  The arcade version of DDR Extreme had so many songs that the home release couldn't contain them all and they released two games.  DDR Extreme had all the new original songs, plus some favorites.  While DDR Party Collection contained the bulk of the favorites and classics they couldn't pack into DDR Extreme.  It used the exact same engine as DDR Extreme, and had just as many songs!</p><p>We played this game a few times at DDR Nights in college, as Tony had a ROM copy, but I wished someday to own a legitimate copy.   Throughout my Study Abroad in Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  Throughout my yearly vacations to Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  I eventually gave up and decided to buy a copy off ebay, but they were no longer listed!  No one was selling.</p><p>It was <b>one year ago yesterday</b> that I finally found a copy.  My 6 year long quest had finally come to its end in Kumamoto.  And it was a fated encounter...</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto</b></div><p>After Dave and I visited Kagoshima, we traveled North to Kumamoto.  Kumamoto is Kyushu's central prefecture, and it's focal point is the gigantic castle in the dead center of town.  Dave and I were able to visit the castle, but only 30-40 minutes before it closed.  Afterward, we wondered what to do.</p><p>On my map, I had one location written down which was a Geo (video game store) not too far east of the Capitol.  We ventured down the castle hill, and made it to the train station.  We passed some delicious looking restaurants on the way there, but wanted to ensure we got on the train.  When we got to the train station, the train wasn't scheduled to arrive for another 20 or 30 minutes, so we backtracked to this interesting hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p><div class='title'><b>Choboiyaki</b></div><p>This restaurant served Okonomiyaki, but it's not the type you would expect.  It was definitely prepared in a similar manner, but the pancake was HUGE.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp"  /></p><p>The radius of this pancake is about as large as the diameter should be.

Between her semi-decent english and my horrible Japanese, we were able to talk a little bit about what she was actually making...</p><p>Japan may look somewhat small, especially compared to the United States, but it is incredibly diverse.  As a country, Japan grew from isolation, and that isolation spread to its culture, and it culture is known for taking elements of other culture, assimilating them, and expanding on them.  So you get plenty of local cultural traits you won't find anywhere else.  And this especially applies to food.</p><p>This particular version of Okonomiyaki is only local to Kumamoto and is known as Choboiyaki.  At least I think that's what she said.  Here's a pic of the menu with the name on it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp">Image!</a>.  Maybe it's just Choboyaki...  or Chobomiyaki, except the 'ya' fire kanji immediately follows 'chobo'.  I dunno...</p><div class='title'><b>Off to Geo</b></div><p>That stuff was delicious and unique, but it's off to the game store to kill time.  I'm sure Dave was somewhat bored with my over-attentive scrutiny of searching every single game they owned, so I didn't go through absolutely everything.  I searched PS2 games and found nothing.  I skimmed PS1, skimmed Saturn, searched Dreamcast, and that was pretty much it.  I couldn't quit find the Rhythm game section for PS2, but didn't want to bore Dave that much more.</p><p>Though, on my way out, Beatmania caught my eye.  "Hold on a second.." I said as I crotched down to take a look, and HOLY CRAP!  What do you know!  It just so happened that they had a copy of DDR Party Collection on the shelf.  I was pretty surprised, as I had never seen this game in the wild.  Though, I didn't get my hopes completely up, as in the past, I happened across a game on the shelf, and they ultimated didn't actually have it in stock.</p><p>I took the case to the counter as my only purchase.  They went around the corner to search through their PS2 games, and didn't seem to immediately find it.  The two girls came back to the counter to take a look at the case again and noticed something they had missed on first glance.  They went to the back and came back with this:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp"  /></p><p>Exclamation point!  Not only did they have a copy of the game, they had the limited edition release of the game that came with a dance pad, complete with bucket.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp"  /></p><p>I looked closer at the sales label (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp">pictured here</a>), and it had the sale date as Dec 11th, 2003.  Not only did they have this in their possesion, but it's been since RELEASE DAY!  It had waited for 6 1/2 years collecting dust and being constantly passed up but patrons until I came through the doors.  One of the games I've been searching for 6 years, and I found a release copy NEW.</p><p>This is fate.  I immediately bought it.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a bucket of DDR turned into a slight difficulty considering Dave and I packed VERY lightly for our trip.  I had no room for this thing in my luggage.  But how could I not keep this thing that I was destined to own!</p><p>Well, I don't need the crappy DDR pad.  So, I threw that in the trash.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp"  /></p><p>I stuff the bucket full of my dirty clothes</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp"  /></p><p>And doing so gave me plenty of room to store in my luggage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp"  /></p><p>Perfect!</p><p>And so my quest ends.  The game that took me the longest time to find was finally found.  (Actually, I guess that's not true, as I've been searching for a copy of Snatcher on Sega CD since the late 90s.)  With DDR Party in hand, my PS2 DDR Collection is complete.  I have all the games I want. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Running in 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/running-in-2011">Running in 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 9, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I ran my first Half Marathon of the 2011 Season.  And by Season, I mean an somewhat arbitrary range of dates to split up my winter races and non-winter races.  Training is much more difficult in the winter, so I don't want my winter times bringing down my non-winter times.</p><div class='title'><b>Seasons</b></div><p>What I am defining as the 2011 Running Season is basically Last April to Late October.  This is just for the Midwest and like-climates though.  Warmer climates would make it much easier to train and run all year round, so the "season" would probably just be the entire year.</p><p>For me, the season began last weekend with Madison's annual Crazy Legs Classic.  It's a 8 kilometer run from Capitol Square, through UW-Madison campus, and ending on Randal Field.  It's a really good start for the year, and the entire town really gets into it.  Almost 10,000 runners competed this year.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting back into Running</b></div><p>I did much better than last year, but I felt incredibly sluggish.  Winter makes it nearly impossible for me to train.  I can't train outside because it's too cold, and I can't train inside because it's too boring.  Before hitting the pavement back in March, I hadn't done any running at all since the Seattle Half Marathon and the Sandbox Indoor Half Marathon.  </p><p>Getting back into the work out is hard.  It was still cold out, so I wasn't getting any positive vibes from the sun.  And I felt horrible after each run.  I didn't feel like I was getting any benefit from it at all.  But there's one thing I've learned from running over the past 2 years.  <b>Motivation builds off of itself.</b>  </p><p>I know that running is beneficial for me, so I had to force myself to get out there and do it.  For April, I was outside every other day, and still felt like I wasn't getting any from it, but I kept doing it.</p><p>My Crazy Legs time wasn't the greatest (50 minutes), but I did better than last year.  Later in the week on Wednesday, the sun was out and shining, and I had an amazing run that day.  I was actually starting to feel some of the benefits of running, even though I still felt like crap.</p><div class='title'><b>Door County Half Marathon</b></div><p>This past weekend, I ran in the Door County Half Marathon, and going into it, I wasn't feeling very optimistic.  I still felt sluggish, and figured I would get a 2:30, or something.  But that wasn't the case.  I pushed forward, and actually started feeling really good.  In the middle of the race, my legs started matching pace with what I was capable of last year.  I was flying down hills, and able to build off of specific songs I was listening to.  I glided across the finish line and achieved a 2:20:02.</p><p>2:20 isn't my best time, but it is much faster than where I was at last year at this time.  My 2010 time for Door County was 2:34, and it was the first race where I really pushed myself.  I figured I would be around the same time this year, but I feel great that I was able to retain much of the speed I was working towards last year.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Getting a decent time (for me) has given me new motivation to continue to run, and do much better than last year.  I have 3 goals this year, but they all lead to the same thing.  1) I want to surpass my high score of 2:13.  2) I want to surpass 2:03, which is the world record for the FULL marathon.  and 3) I want to surpass 2 hours.  So, even though, they are 3 separate goals, they are really the same goal.  I guess "milestones" would be a better way to describe it.</p><p>Currently, I'm signed up for 2 more half marathons this year, but I'm sure I'll sign up for more as time goes on.</p><p>May 29th // Madison Half Marathon<br/>Aug 20th // Madison Mini-Marathon</p><p>Additionally, I signed up for my first FULL marathon, which is Milwaukee's Lakefront Marathon.  I was actually planning on signing up last year, but it was completely full by the time I decided to do so.  That takes place on October 2nd, so there is plenty of time to train and build up to it.</p><p>Run run run!</p><p>Also, if you're wondering, I keep track of all my racing times through Google Docs.  Here's a public link for that information:<br/><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html" title="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html">https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-ds-carrying-case-puppet">Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 22, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nintendo's new handheld, the Nintendo 3DS is set for release this Sunday.  And I've had one on preorder ever since they've announced the price and release date.  I wrote something a few weeks ago about how excited I was about it: <a href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds" title="/nintendo-3ds">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=829</a>.  I wasn't excited for the 3D so much, as I was to finally have a second DS for trading of Pokemon.</p><p>This week, the gaming press have gotten their review units, and have written some reviews and comments about the handheld.  There have been 2 concerns that are starting to make me doubt whether I should purchase the Nintendo 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Battery Life</b></div><p>Apparently, if you're using the Nintendo 3DS under the lowest settings without any 3D, you can only get about 4 1/2 hours worth of game time out of it!  And then it takes about 3 1/2 hours to fully charge the thing.  This is ridiculous compared to my DS Lite, which I can play for hours and hours, and never think to charge it.</p><p>How is the Nintendo 3DS supposed to be a handheld if I'm always tethered to an electrical outlet?  How is this supposed to work if when I go to on a long vacation and want to play through Okamiden, or Zelda Spirit Tracks?  I'll be constantly charging the stupid thing.</p><p>Source from Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars" title="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars</a></p><div class='title'><b>DS Rendering</b></div><p>The 3DS screens have higher resolution as the DS.  As such, if you're playing a DS in full screen mode, the image is stretched and the pixels are not 1 to 1.  You can fix this by running DS games in their native resolution, but it is small.  Almost, Gameboy Micro small.  Also, according to the Destructoid article, the colors are slightly washed out.  DS games look much more brilliant on a DSi or a DSi XL.</p><p>This would really hamper my experience with the 3DS for the first several months as I will be using it to play DS games.  With the added processing power of the 3DS, you'd think they make the games look better, much like the Playstation 2 did with PS1 games.</p><p>Source from Destructoid: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml">http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml</a><br/>Also, Kotaku or Joystiq wrote the exact same thing a few weeks ago.</p><div class='title'><b>Buy or not Buy</b></div><p>So now, I'm a little torn.  It seems like if I get a 3DS, I will still be using my DS quite often.  I might only use the 3DS for 3DS games (of which none I care about), or the built in games (which are not full games, but little time wasters), or the eStore (which won't even be ready by launch).</p><p>Let's take a look at a timeline.</p><p>November 21st, 2004 - Nintendo DS<br/>June 11th, 2006 - Nintendo DS Lite<br/>April 5th, 2009 - Nintendo DSi<br/>March 29th, 2010 - Nintendo DSi XL</p><p>March 27th, 2010 - Nintendo 3DS</p><p>With the release of each recent handheld, they've had another one fixing problems not too long after.  With the original horrid ugly looking DS, they replaced that thing with the pretty DS Lite a year and a half later.  The DS Lite fixed all the design problems they had with the DS.  It improved battery life, full LCD screens, in a smaller, more compact design.  I did not own a DS until the DS Lite was released, and by then, there was an actual reason to own one.</p><p>Given the uproar about the current battery life of the Nintendo 3DS, I doubt it'll take long before they come up with the solution.  I should really wait for that solution rather than spending $250 on something that might end up sitting on my shelf for the months to come.</p><p>If anything, the release of the Nintendo 3DS should bring down the price of used DSs.  Maybe I'll pick up a DSi XL.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A few more links on Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-few-more-links-on-japan">A few more links on Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 20, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, a bunch of us nerds went down to Chicago for their newest comic book convention, C2E2.  C2E2 is short for Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo, and does have more than just comic books.  It extends itself to the Entertainment industry, so it also has some guest appearances, and Q&amp;A panels for specific television shows.</p><p>I was rather excited to go since I missed PAX East this year, and I had never been to a Comic Con before.  I figured it would be in the vain of the San Diego Comic Con, or the New York Comic Con, where it has some comic book stuff, but has grown into TV shows, movies, and video games.  And while it did have some of that stuff, it was definitely muted and mediocre compared to the comic content.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp"  /></p><p>We arrived at the McCormic Park Place around 9:30am, which gave us a good 30 minutes before the Convention opened.  In very much PAX fashion, when arriving early, they had us go into a queue room when all the other early participants and patiently wait in line for the exhibition hall.  Con staff riled up the crowd with some chants in attempts to get video.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any crowd games for us to play :(</p><p>10am arrived, and we entered the exhibition hall.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The exhibition hall was jammed packed with comic distributors, indie comic and toy stores from the Chicago area, Tshirt vendors and other random stuff.  For a comic book convention, I expected vendors to have a large supply on hand, and maybe I would be able to fill in the gaps of my own comic collection, ala Battle Chasers #8, and The Maxx Trades #4 &amp; #5.</p><p>No such luck...  It seems that all the comic vendors at this convention specialize in ACTUAL rare comics, and my gaps were merely uncommon.  Comic book vendors had piles of vintage comics that had been appraised and worth plenty of cash.  And I wasn't interested in that.  I suppose I should have been checking prices because now I'm getting curious.  I wonder what the most expensive comic at the Con was...</p><p>There was one booth in the exhibition hall that I did want to check out, which was the Cyanide &amp; Happiness booth, and Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal attached themselves to.  I picked up one of C&amp;H's books and got it signed.  I also picked up SMBC's DVD of shorts, got that signed, and then got an on-the-fly sketch by SMBC artist, Zach Weiner.  I asked for some science related, and he didn't disappoint.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp"  /></p><p>The artist alley was nearly bone dry.  I have no interest in comic book looking art, which was the style of the vast majority of artists.  There were a few that caught my eye though.  I liked the style of <a href="http://erikrose.com/portfolio.htm" title="http://erikrose.com/portfolio.htm">Erik Rose</a>, whose art is based on a lot of films.  I didn't find any prints I especially like, but I bought a few buttons.  Another rockin artist was <a href="http://-amaya-.deviantart.com" title="http://-amaya-.deviantart.com">Tanya Zolotareva</a>, who had a very distinct gothy style and much different than all the other artists there.  Also, <a href="http://www.davidmack.net/" title="http://www.davidmack.net/">David Mack</a> was there, who has done some great work with the Kabuki series of comics.</p><p>Also, in the exhibition hall were the autograph booths.  Stars of TV, film, and music sat at booths for hours during the day and people lined up to get something autographed, or get their photo taken with them.  They had Sam and Pan from True Blood, who are two of my favorite characters on that show.  And they had Shane and Andrea from The Walking Dead, who are two of my LEAST favorite characters on that show.  They also had Helo from Battlestar Galatica, also my favorite character.</p><p>While that is pretty awesome, I find it odd that they got the B roll of characters for this convention.  That's like saying "We have the cast of The Simpsons", but then only Moe and Barney show up.  I guess you take what you can get.  Unfortunately, approaching these stars ISN'T free.  You can't just walk up to a celebrity without your wallet.  Duh...  Autographs were $30, and photos for $35.  Fuck that...  Off the top of my head, I can't even think of a celebrity I would pay to get a photo taken.  Maybe Keanu Reeves, but Keanu wouldn't allow that.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway, the exhibition hall was boring, so the next best time killer is going to Panels.  As one would expect, most of these panels were comic book related, and most of those were Marvel.  I don't think I could care less about Marvel, or DC, or any popular comic books.  Superhero comic books are so boring.</p><p>Even before arriving, the only panels that I was interested in were Evangelion related.  Spike Spencer (american voice of Shinji) was at the convention, and on Saturday, he was introducing Evangelion 1.0 before they screened it.  He also had a panel later on about voice acting.  While I don't really care about Spike Spencer, it was Evangelion related, and there was nothing else for me to do.  I didn't make Evangelion 1.0, but I did sit in on the last 10 minutes of his voice acting panel, which was Q&amp;A when I arrived.  Most of the questions were inside jokes that I did not get.</p><p>But success! I got my Evangelion Bluray signed by him, as well as purchasing his self published (and self printed) book about voice acting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess I had fun.  I was expecting a lot more video game related things, and more overall nerd culture, but it was all comic book instead.  And I would say that's a good thing, as the San Diego Comic Con, and New York Comic Con have slowly been overrun by thing that aren't comic books.  C2E2 is bringing back the Comic book convention to the comic book nerds, rather than succumb to the wiles of more popular entertainment.  But it still has some of that entertainment which makes the larger conventions so successful.</p><p>I would probably go again.  Especially if we had another large group of con-goers to hang out with, as we did this time.  I even ran into an old SPAMM member that wasn't part of our group!  It was good times :)</p><p>There were also quite a bit of costumers.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to More links on Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/more-links-on-japan">More links on Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Here's a couple recent articles:<br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367571/Japanese-tsunami-earthquake-U-S-fears-nuclear-fuel-rods-exposed.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367571/Japanese-tsunami-earthquake-U-S-fears-nuclear-fuel-rods-exposed.html">Exposed: Nuclear fuel rods inside wrecked Japan reactor as experts predict radioactive plume could reach U.S. TODAY</a><br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367125/Japan-tsunami-Fukushima-Fifty-suicide-mission-battle-nuclear-meltdown.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367125/Japan-tsunami-Fukushima-Fifty-suicide-mission-battle-nuclear-meltdown.html">Courage of the Fukushima fifty: This is suicide, admit workers trying to avert a catastrophe</a><br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367309/Japan-earthquake-tsunami-Tokyo-ghost-town.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367309/Japan-earthquake-tsunami-Tokyo-ghost-town.html">Dark days in ghost town of Tokyo: The deserted streets of a once vibrant capital now crippled by power cuts</a><br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367208/Japan-tsunami-earthquake-Mayor-claims-people-abandoned.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367208/Japan-tsunami-earthquake-Mayor-claims-people-abandoned.html">'We have been betrayed': Mayor of town near stricken Japanese nuclear plant claims his people have been 'abandoned'</a><br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367473/Elderly-hospital-patients-left-die-Japans-nuclear-zone-400-000-fight-survive-tsunami-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367473/Elderly-hospital-patients-left-die-Japans-nuclear-zone-400-000-fight-survive-tsunami-humanitarian-crisis.html">Elderly patients left to die in hospital six miles from Japan's stricken nuclear power plant</a></p><p>Another few sites that have had some great information about what is going on over there are some blogs that I follow about Japanese News in general.<br/>News on Japan: <a href="http://newsonjapan.com/" title="http://newsonjapan.com/">http://newsonjapan.com/</a><br/>Japan Probe: <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/" title="http://www.japanprobe.com/">http://www.japanprobe.com/</a></p><div class='title'><b>Tokyo</b></div><p>It seems that Tokyo feels like a ghost town.  Many buildings have cut off all non-essential power and the extremely bright city is now dimmed.  The streets that are usually overwhelmed with people are now empty.  Everyone is at home indoors.  Most businesses aren't operating because of the power loss, so people don't have much to do.  A friend of mine lives in Tokyo, and he's says that he's pretty much bored.  There's not much to do when work is canceled and the power is out.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita Airport</b></div><p>As I mentioned before, I had a trip to Japan all figured out before the earthquake happened.  I was set to leave next Thursday March 24th.  I was flying out on United and they've granted anyone with tickets before March 31st a chance to rebook their flight for free (<a href="http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6867,52939,00.html" title="http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6867,52939,00.html">link</a>).  So, I'm in the process of doing that now.  My trip will be postponed to May or June sometime.</p><p>I'm not really worried about the danger so much, but I would be one more person in the way and using up resources in a city where most foreign countries have asked their citizens to evacuate.  Narita is being over run by people fleeing the country right now.  I read an article that says all the hotels nearby are completely full.  And most people are showing up to Narita without any tickets buying the first flight they can out of there.  Some tickets are selling for $3000, and many airlines have been sending extra flights to accomodate the mass exodus.</p><p>Also, Most trains and busses are packed with people fleeing the city.  So, heading out to Tokyo is definitely a bad decision at this time.</p><div class='title'><b>Youtube</b></div><p>A few more videos have popped up on youtube that have caught my eye.</p><p>Here's a childrens video describing the situation at the Fukushima reactor.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko</a></p><p>CBS posted a video of the Tsunami water pouring into a town right on the ocean.  This video really shows how powerful the waves are.  Houses are being uprooted, and building torn down.  What I find disturbing is that the cameraman pans to the right and shows a person on a nearby building.  He pans back to the left when the water really starts moving.  A minute later he pans back to the right and that building is COMPLETELY gone!  Along with that person :(<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI</a></p><p>Another sad video that is getting a lot of attention is about those two dogs.  One dog stands by another wounded dog.  Many people view this as a symbol of how Japan continues to endour this disaster.<br/><a href="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php" title="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php">http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Onion</b></div><p class='img'>The Onion had a few things to say referencing the disaster in Japan.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BrookeAlvarez/status/48035078793728000" title="http://twitter.com/#!/BrookeAlvarez/status/48035078793728000"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp"></a></p><p>Nuclear Energy Advocates Insist U.S. Reactors Completely Safe Unless Something Bad Happens<br/><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/" title="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/">http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/</a></p><div class='title'><b>Donate!</b></div><p>Once again, Donate if you can.<br/><a href="http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html" title="http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html">http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Crisis in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crisis-in-japan">Crisis in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 16, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the last week, Japan has been slammed with crisis.  They were rocked with a 9.0 earthquake, followed by the resulting Tsunami, and currently trying to prevent a Nuclear meltdown from the damaged incurred by the earthquake and tsunami.  I wanted to write something up real quick that a lot of links to video, photos, and other information about what's going on over there.</p><p>I've been keeping a close eye on everything as Japan is quite special to me.  I have several friends living there, and I'm concerned about them.  Also, because my brother and I had a vacation scheduled from March 24th through April 5th, and I was wondering how feasible it would be to continue with those plans.  We have rescheduled our trip to sometime in May or June.</p><div class='title'><b>Earthquake</b></div><p class='img'>On March 11th, around 3pm local time, the 9.0 earthquake struck in the ocean about 100 miles east of Sendai, but the resulting aftershocks and several more earthquakes continued hours after the initial rumble.

I don't really know all the details on how a nuclear power plant works, and what they've been doing to contain it.  Reddit user dwolf12345 posted an AMA since he's a reactor operator at a US plant very similar to Fukushima<br/><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/" title="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/</a></p><p><em>"The fission reaction stops nearly instantly, however while the core is at power all the material in the core becomes INCREDIBLY radioactive. So after the fission reaction stops there is still considerable heat being generated due to radioactive decay of the fuel and other activated core components (this is called decay heat).</p><p>This is the heat that is causing the issues in Japan. It can take a day or two to cool the core down to below the boiling point even with good decay heat removal systems. As long as the vessel is kept full and the temperature brought down slowly and deliberately there is no issue at all. But take away that cooling system and the water it provides and you've got problems."</em></p><p><em>"It is very bad. No hyperbole there...nuclear plants NEED electrical power, even when shut down to ensure that the fuel stays cool. These plants were blacked out (no AC power) for 2-3 days. Normally losing off-site power is recoverable because of the on-site emergency diesel generators, however in this case they were swamped. In all likelihood they went without AC and DC power for a very long time. This means that any actions taken to stabilize the plant had to be manual(since there was no control power for remote controlling stations). They have gone deep down in their emergency plans, probably (although I am not sure of this) into their Severe Accident Management Guidelines. This means that they are beyond their design basis. Sort of into unknown territory, which is frightening to me.</p><div class='title'><b>If they are injecting seawater that means that they are no longer concerned with recovering these reactors.</b> It means that they have fallen back to "protect the public" mode. So far from what I have read, there is very likely fuel melt, but the reactor vessels and the primary containments are still intact. The hydrogen explosions occurred in their secondary containments due to build-up of vented steam/gasses from the primary containments or reactor vessels. Not sure if this is a design difference or due to the deranged equipment, our plant would vent the gas outside of both containments. <b>One thing is for sure, hydrogen almost surely means melted cladding and fuel damage.</b></div><p>Now I hear there is a fire on site and it may be threatening the spent fuel pool of one unit. This worries me more than the other issues right now. Spent fuel on the pool is within the secondary containment, but outside the primary containment. Needless to say it is HIGHLY radioactive. Assuming the primary containments hold at all the facilities, then the fuel pool is much more vulnerable and dangerous.</p><p>Keep in mind, these guys are in new territory here. They may have drilled and trained for these scenarios, but nothing ever goes exactly according to plan. I have much respect for the guys who are there and fighting this beast."</em></p><p><em>"<b>First off this cannot be like Chernobyl as they are very different animals.</b> Chernobyl actively exploded the reactor vessel. Chernobyl had no primary containment (by design), only a secondary containment structure. So when it blew the vessel head off, it and the steam plume blasted the building apart. Chernobyl fuel was open to the sky, no barrier at all between the public and the molten core of the reactor. That is why it spewed millions of curies of radioactive particulate into the sky.</p><p>There is a threat with the spent fuel pools. I don't know how much fuel they have in their pools, if any. If they do it is just as hazardous as what is in the core, with one exception. It is outside the primary containment structure. This makes it a little more worrisome in my opinion. I haven't heard much mention of the spent fuel pools at any of the affected units. I hope that is because everything there is under control. They do not require much cooling, because most of it has been removed from a core for a long time and has had many half-lives to decay away, so there is little decay heat. However, it is still quite radioactive.</p><p>The containment at Daiichi is much different than Chernobyl. Assuming that the fuel melted in all three of the affected reactors then there is still a very robust reactor vessel and a even more robust primary containment structure. Both are designed to be flood-able, and we know that they are filling up with borated seawater. </p><p>The name of the game now is cover and cool. This is what they are doing. I think there will be and has been release of radioactive materials, but so far they are keeping those cards close to the vest. I think in time it will be revealed to be orders of magnitude less than Chernobyl.</p><p>There is some news that Daiichi 2 has had a breach in the reactor vessel. That means that there is in all likelihood some fuel material out of the vessel and in the primary containment structure. Not time to panic yet, just need them to keep cooling that containment."</em></p><p><em>"Worst case...all the threatened containments fail and/or the fuel pools drain/collapse. The amount of radioactive material released is huge and we get an Asian version of Pripyat.</p><p>The reactors are shutdown now and they are getting water into the vessels (borated seawater). So, we are dealing with decay heat and it is not likely there will be a massive explosion a la Chernobyl, but the release could still be huge."</em></p><p>The Wikipedia entry for the Fukushima disaster is being updated constantly.

They have also roaming scheduled blackouts to keep the electrical output needed at a minimum.</p><p>Eva Geeks comments that there's a grassroots movement of nerds to dub these blackouts and brownouts after an event that happens in the Evangelion television show and movies, entitled Operation Yashima.
