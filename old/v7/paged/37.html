| February 28, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dead Space 2 is a game of many emotions.  For me, it was a 3 stage process.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 1: Disappointment</b></div><p>Isaac awoke from his bed in a medical lab somewhere and was told to get running!  Oh my, I don't remember these contols being so disorienting.  If you break the display into 3 sections, Isaac is positioned right between the left and middle sections.  Initially, this forces me to think that pushing directly up on the joystick will make Issac turn to the left slightly.  So, I try to compensate by push up and right, which make him run forward to the right.  I compensate by pulling back left, but then he doesn't move as far left I was thinking.  ugh :(</p><p>Also, Isaac was in a straight jacket the whole time, so that might be why it was so disorienting.  After an hour of running around, I was getting rather frustrated, so I put it down and went to bed.  I picked it up the next day with my expectations realigned, and ready to continue the journey.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 2: Delightment</b></div><p>Once I had become one with the controls, Dead Space's wonderful concept of immerson took center stage.  I was no longer controlling Isaac, I WAS Isaac.  Dead Space 2 is right at home with everything I loved about the first game, namely the environment and the sound.</p><div class='title'><b>The Moon!</b></div><p>While going through offices, homes, and stores in this mess of a space station or space ship or whatever, people kept referring to it as "Titan".  I figured it was just the name of the place, until I entered a room with a complete view of the outside.  It was Saturn!  The planet Saturn!  It hung so beautifully in the spacey sky.  And I realized that by "Titan", they meant the MOON!</p><p>In Dead Space 1, they just made up some planet for the Ishimura to crack.  I think it was called Aegis?  Actually, seeing how Aegis is greek, there probably is a moon with that name in our Solar System, but no where near reknowned as Titan.</p><p>The Titan moon base continued with Dead Space's theme of an organic, yet synthetic environment, ala Alien Resurrection.  And it's horrific display of gore and twisted ideals, ala Event Horizon.  Unlike the Ishimura from the first game, the Titan moon base feels much more comfortable.  Much of the environment feels dank because all the lights have been blown out and there's blood everywhere.  Before all hell broke loose, I'm sure much the locations looked a lot like Star Trek, or Mass Effect.  They just needed a fresh coat of blood to tear them down.</p><p>Now that we're running through a sustainable ecosystem, rather than an engineering vessel, there is much more variety.  You find yourself going through residential units, a mall, a church, and an elementary school, before you get to the space station stuff.</p><p>Dead Space doesn't miss the opportunity to go creepy with the elementary school.  There are now baby necromorphs and 5th grader necromorphs.  I think the 5th graders are my favorite enemy in the game.  10 or 15 of them will appear from a doorway and attempt to swarm you, while keeping their distance.</p><p>Rather than shooting them down with my gun, I always go for melee. Â It reminds me a lot of this website: <a href="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/" title="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/">How many five years olds could you take in a fight?</a> The website is purely theoretical, and this was my "real life" chance to find out!  I was able to take down about 6 of 'em, before 3 more jumped on top of me and brought me down.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp">Get these goddamn children off of me!</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Mood</b></div><p>Unfortunately with the amount of variety in the environment itself, sound took second place to art.  While the mood is as immersive as the first game, each area is distinct because of the environment itself, not because it sounds different.  Two of my favorite moments from Dead Space 1 were the engine room, and the first moment you hit space.</p><p>The engine room was massively loud.  The whirring of the engine completely over came my senses, and made progress a bit disorienting.  Even more so when the enemies broke into the room and I had to fight them while the huge, loud engine was right on top of me.  There is nothing like this in Dead Space 2.</p><p>The only parts in Dead Space 2 where the sound takes center stage is Space, which is completely the same as the first game.  There are several points when you are thrust into the vacuum of space to complete your task.  When this happens all sound is sucked out of the environment, and the only thing you hear is yourself.  The beeping on your oxygen tank, your breath as you exhale into your helmet, and the muddled clomps of your foot steps.</p><p>Astronauts describe the feeling of being in space as very isolating.  There is nothing between you and space, but the layer of your space suit.  Dead Space nailed this feeling perfectly, so I'm glad they brought it back for the sequel.  And now you have thrusters to fly through Space!</p><div class='title'><b>Mood Killer</b></div><p>One thing I really hate about Dead Space 2 is the use of scare tactics.  Dead Space 2 does an incredible job of immersing you in the environment and lulling you into an intent state, only to tear everything down by a monster popping out of the wall, or jumping out at you from behind a corner.  It doesn't make the game scary.  Being startled is not being scared. Â By the fourth or fifth time, I just shrug it off and blow them away. There's no sense of danger, or being spooked.</p><p>It's the difference between somewhere coming up from behind you and yelling "BOO", rather than walking through the woods at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 3: Frustration</b></div><p>It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt :(</p><p>Dead Space 2 is quite an enjoyable experience until you get to the final chapters of the game.  All story points converge at the government sector of the moon base.  You've lead all the enemies of the game to this point, so now you need to fight them all.  And you have a new enemy which cannot be killed, only slowed down.</p><p>Throughout the entire game, ammunition and health had never really been a problem.  I have died quite a bit, but it was usually because I did something stupid.  Dead Space would train me not to do that, and point out it should be done this way.  I adapted and continued.  I would always have enough health packs lying around to heal me, and plenty of ammo around to keep me moving through the hordes of enemies.</p><p>In the second to last chapter, Dead Space pretty much gave up on this balance.  The enemies were more difficult, and there were more of them.  I started using a whole lot of ammunition taking them down without enough to return to take on the next wave.  So, I started getting hit more, and using up my health packs.  Wave after wave of enemies continued, and I no longer had health to regen.</p><p>I basically pushed and shoved my way through all the enemies to make progress, which resulted in many many lives, and many many restarts.  Yes, I wasn't really thinking about how I could improve, but with constant failure, I just wanted to get it done.  I finally made it to the final checkout, which was complete with a Store to resupply.</p><p>What awaited behind that checkout was another constant horde of enemies, I had to push through to get to the final boss.  But when I made it, I was all out of ammo and health again.  Basically fucked.  I tried taking them down, but after 30 minutes, I quit.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>With a good night's rest to think about my options, I returned with a plan.  I sold all my extra ammo and focused completely on the only gun I had completely leveled up, my Plasma Cutter.  With my strategy realigned, I tore through the horde, pushing most of them aside to greet the final boss, again.  This time I blasted the shit of them.  They hardly stood a chance.</p><p>Overall, Dead Space 2 did not let me down.  I feel like it had a few incredible scenes and sequences, sewn together by a solid base.  Before I got to the end, I had a very enjoyable time, and I'll probably pick it up again to chew away at the remaining achievements.</p><p>I would totally recommend Dead Space 2 for anyone that has fond memories of the original.</p><p>Also, the legend continues (or begins) with Dead Space Extraction included on the disc!  Plus, there is DLC releasing tomorrow that ties Extraction into Dead Space 2, entitled "Severed".<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Protest!

| February 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today is Friday, and I grabbed a few more pictures after work.  There were many protesters right outside Walker's office banging on their drums during his press conference.  And there were plenty of protestors in the center of the rotunda riling up the crowd.</p><p>The Capitol has changed quite a bit over the past week.  People have started calling this place home.  There are family areas, food areas, and even a lending library.  Sleeping bags and mattresses line the walls on the upper levels.  And the noise level has calmed down quite a bit from the massive high energy yells of the crowd, to a somber rhythmic pounding of drums.</p><p>I feel like much of today is holding off, and building up support for the massive demostrations planned for tomorrow.  I've been invited to so many facebook events for rallies starting at Noon on Saturday.</p><p>Anywho...  pictures!</p><p class='img'><img

Saturday was a huge day with 100,000 protestors on the square.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0481.webp"  /></p><p>Sunday brought some colder weather, and the Capitol grounds are looking bear from the outside.  But the entire is going just as strong as it has all last week.  Today's weather was just as bad, but it brought a well needed energetic boost with a supportive concert courtey of Tom Morello of Rage against the Machine.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0536.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0536.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0536.webp"  /></p><p>The concert started off with several speakers whipping the crowd into a frenzy for about 45 minutes.  Tom Morello took the stage and stating why he throws his support behind the unions of Wisconsin.  And then a bunch of musicians took the stage and started singing.  After 45 minutes of acoustic guitar cover songs, we had had enough, and left.</p><p>Actually, I did enjoy the Street Dogs' first song.  The Street Dogs are a band with lead singer Mike McColgan, who used to be the lead singer of Dropkick Murphy.  Their first song was something they wrote specifically for the event, and had the same Irish enthusiasm you'd expect from the Dropkick Murphys.  It was called "Up for unions" or something like that.</p><p>Anyways, we left for the Capitol.  Most of the people were at the concert, but there were still a bunch of people fighting the good fight.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0565.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0565.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0566_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0566_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0566_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0579_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0579_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0579_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0596.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0594.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0594.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0594.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0595.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0595.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0595.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0597.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0597.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0597.webp"  /></p><p>Tomorrow is a big day, as they plan on actually voting for the bill, or passing through some legislative parts of it, or something.

A few hundred showed up on Monday, a few thousand on Tuesday, 13,000 on Wednesday, and they are predicting 30,000 will show up today.  When I entered the Capitol, I was blown away (ign dot com) by the noise.  I feel like I was entering a basketball game.</p><p>The center of the Capitol has a drum circle that thunders throughout the building.

It's too bad I won't be able to attend this year.  But there's plenty of stuff going on in the midwest to keep me busy.</p><p>If I were going to PAX East, these are the panels I would definitely want to attend:</p><p><b>1UP Presents: Retronauts Vs. 16 Bits</b> - Friday @ 3pm<br/>Live recording of 1up's defunct Retronauts podcast including panelists Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi.  Though, they will most likely record this panel and release it on 1up.com, so missing this panel won't hurt.  I ususally never go anyway.</p><p><b>From Background To Center Stage: Building Game Worlds As Main Characters</b> - Friday @ 5pm<br/>A panel including Irrational Games members Ken Levine and Shawn Elliot, headed by Julian Murdoch.  Plenty of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite matters included...</p><p><b>Inside Game Localization</b> - Friday @ 8pm<br/>Including the leads at Kajiya Productions as they discuss localizing Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics Ogre, among other things.</p><p><b>PAX East Chiptune Showcase</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>Zen Albatross hosts an event with some of the best chip artists from the east coast including Sabrepulse, Br1ght Pr1mate, and himself.</p><p><b>Owned but Independent</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>At the same time, a panel including Brian Raffel and Eric Biessman of local Madison game studio, Raven, discuss what it's like to be "owned" by Activision.  Even though, I would end up going to the Chiptune panel, it'd be nice to support local game development. ^_^</p><p><b>Videogame Antiques Roadshow</b> - Saturday @ 6:30pm<br/>A panel including Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi discuss game collecting and finding value in old games.</p><p><b>Making the "Citizen Kane" of Poker Games</b> - Sunday @ 3pm<br/>Idle Thumbs alert.  Sean Vanaman, Jake Rodkin and other Telltale Games members speak about the development of Poker Night at the Inventory.</p><p>These are all the ones that really popped out at me.  There's also the really high attendance panels such as the Penny Arcade panels, and everything in the main room, but I usually skip those.  I've attended enough of those in the past that I would know what to expect and there's plenty of other things that would keep me busy.</p><p>But yeah, I'm skipping PAX East this year. Â I plan on attending PAX Normal, as I do each year, so you can catch me there.</p><p>Here's the link to the full panel schedule: <a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php" title="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php">http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Day after Yesterday" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-day-after-yesterday">The Day after Yesterday</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The storm extended itself to Madison, WI, but the temperatures were much higher in our region than the North.  It was a beautiful warm winter day at 40 degrees.

What could have been snow accomulation turned into an inch of ice beneath the 5 or 6 inches that continued into the night.</p><p>Oh well, we were still dumped on.</p><p>I had nothing to do today.

| October 31, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past Thursday, I was lucky enough to grab two tickets to an early screening of 20 minutes of the upcoming <b>Tron Legacy</b> film.  Despite being billed as "Tron Night", it really was just 20 minutes of the film.  They showed 5 scenes from the first half of the movie, and finished off with an extended trailer.</p><p>I'll describe each of the scenes, but first I'll refresh everyone's memory on what happened in the first movie.  I just finished watching it a minute ago, so it's all fresh in my mind.  Then I'll get into the new movie.</p><p><b>Tron</b> </p><p>(Spoilers from Tron 1)</p><p>First off, there's <b>Kevin Flynn</b>, as played by Jeff Bridges.  He's the most notable and iconographic character in the Tron universe.  In <b>Tron</b>, Kevin Flynn is a genious video game designer working for ENCOM.  All of his work was stolen by <b>Edward Dillinger</b>, played by David Warner.  Dillinger took all the credit of Flynn's genious, and quickly rose the ranks to a top executive position.</p><p>Meanwhile, Flynn hides out in his arcade.  Many of the games produced by ENCOM line his walls.  After hours, he relentlessly hacks ENCOM's server to find definite evidence of Dilliger's misdeeds.</p><p>The fantasy world inside the computer represents programs as their human users.  Flynn's program is named CLU.  In the first couple scenes of Tron, CLU is captured by security drones and erased by <b>Master Control</b>, locking Flynn out of the ENCOM mainframe.</p><p>Master Control Program is that spinny red cylinder face guy.  MCP is an artificial intelligence set to control most of the company's assets.  When Dillinger tries to take control back from MCP, MCP backmails him into complying.</p><p>Anyways, destroying CLU also locks out <b>Alan Bradley</b>, whose program is named Tron.  Tron is a security protocol set to monitor and regulate Master Control.   There's also a girl named <b>Lora Baines</b>, who works on a laser that dematerializing objects into the mainframe.  Why?  I dunno.</p><p>So, Alan and Lora run off to Flynn's Arcade to warm him that ENCOM has found out about his hacks, and they all hatch a plan to break into the ENCOM building and hack the servers from inside.  Alan goes back to his cubical and waits for communication from Tron, while Lora escorts Flynn to her laser lab to use her computer.  Lora runs off somewhere, and Flynn starts hacking away at the mainframe to find the evidence.  Meanwhile, MCP notices that Flynn is sitting at a terminal in clear sight of the dematerializing laser, so he zaps Flynn into the Matrix.</p><p>Inside the mainframe, we're introduced to <b>Sark</b>, who is Dillinger's program.  If MCP were The Emperor, Sark who be Darth Vader.  His loyal foot soldier who does all the evil deeds without reserve.  Sark gathers up spare and discarded programs and forces them to fight each other in <b>Games</b>.</p><p>There's a little bit of religion stuffed into the plot, as MCP's method of subjugating other programs is dispelling all knowledge of Users.  Some programs believe them to exist, but it's only a legend.</p><p>Flynn is himself when he's inside the mainframe, and meets up with programs that resemble his pals in real life.  Tron resembles Alan.  Lora's program, <b>Yori</b>, resembles her.  They all journey to defeat MCP and restore peace from his tyranny.  Also, throughout the adventure, Flynn figures out he has "god-like" powers over the mainframe because he's a User.</p><p>Spoiler Alert, they defeat Sark and MCP at the end of the movie.  Flynn gets zapped back to real life, and he recovers the evidence he needs to take down Dillinger.  The last scene of the movie shows Flynn flying in on a helicopter and assuming his role as CEO of ENCOM.  HAPPY ENDING!</p><div class='title'><b>Tron Legacy Setup</b></div><p>Fast forward, 28 years later to today, and we have Tron Legacy.  Tron Night showed us 5 scenes from the finished film.  And the first one reiterated what we already know about the initial plot of the film.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 1</b></div><p>The Scene starts with <b>Samuel Flynn</b> returning to his garage home somewhere in the city.  Sam Flynn is son of Kevin Flynn, and he's 27 years old.  <b>Alan Bradley</b> enters the scene and says something like, "That was some stunt you pulled today," referring to some hijinks Sam pulled at ENCOM.  It's been 20 years since Kevin Flynn has mysteriously disappeared, and Sam is agressivly reluctant to take over ENCOM in his father's place.</p><p>Sam tells Alan to fuck off, and Alan is all like "some day you'll understand."  Before leaving, Alan mentions he received a page last night.  The last thing that Flynn said to Alan was to keep the pager at all times, and when the time comes, you'll get further instructions.  The instructions were to go to Flynn's Arcade.  Alan suggests that Sam revisit that abandoned arcade and investigate.</p><p>Next we see Sam riding to the Arcade.  He goes inside and looks around.  He finds a secret passageway behind the Tron arcade game, which leads to a secret room with computers and a dematerializing laser.  Sam starts typing away at the computer, and runs the last instruction, which zaps him into the computer.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 2</b></div><p>The preview skips ahead a little bit to the point where Sam is caught by security drones and brought to central processing with a couple other stray programs.  JUST LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE, Sam is sent to the pit and readied to be in <b>The Games</b>.  He's given his disc-thingy, and then pushed off somewhere.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 3</b></div><p>Sam finds himself in a multi-staged arena.  There's about 8 fights going on.  All are 2 player matches between programs using their discs as weapons.  Sam learns pretty quick that this is a fight to the death, when he sees a victory in another ring.  His "Oh my god what's going on" defense quickly turns into an inexperienced but calculated win as he blows away the ground underneath his opponent.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 4</b></div><p>Oh, I guess Sam has escaped with the help of a masked program.  They're driving away in an all terrain vehicle, while security drones give chase in their light cycles.  They kill a couple drones, but more continue pursuit.  They reach a cliff and go off the end of it into rough unkept terrain which light cycles cannot follow.  They've escaped!</p><p>The masked hero reveals herself to be <b>Quorra</b>, but doesn't mention her importance in the story.  The reach an outpost in the barren wasteland, and go inside.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 5</b></div><p>Quorra brings Sam into a room to reunite him with Flynn.  After they exchange a bunch of heartfelt words, Flynn says something about what's going on, but I don't remember what it was because I had no frame of reference at the time.  I don't think it was much to go on anyways.  </p><p>Also, he calls Quorra his apprentice.  And Flynn has a custom version 1.0 Light Cycle in his room that Quorra says is still the fastest vehicle on the grid.</p><div class='title'><b>Trailer</b></div><p>Right when I thought they were going to unveil more of the overall plot, it was over.  At the end of Scene 5, it goes into the Daft Punk trailer posted to youtube earlier last week.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U">Youtube!</a></p><p>The footage in the first half of the trailer we had already seen that night from the actual scenes, but they added some extended cuts of fight scenes and light cycle chases.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Going into the preview, I hadn't seen Tron in forever, and only knew that Flynn had disappeared in the Matrix and his son goes after him.  Plot-wise, I was hoping to find out more about why Flynn went back into the computer, and what was going on.  There was none of that.  I exited the theater having gained no knowledge of Tron Legacy at all, which was incredibly disappointing.  I really can't form a decent opinion about the movie if I have no idea where it's going.</p><p>But it's definitely pretty.  Really damn pretty.  The preview was in 3D, and I really liked how it wasn't 3D at all in real life, but was completely 3D inside the computer.  It made for a fun transition.</p><p>If you've seen any trailer, or even watch the youtube I posted above, the look of Tron Legacy is gorgeous.  I love the art direction.  All the environments have this luminescent tint outlining their structure against a black surface.  Everything is crisp and clean, like everything is made of glass.  And the 3D effects ephasize the glassy translucent look of everything.  It's marvelous.</p><p>That's really why I'm into this movie.  The first moment I saw how everything looked, I was hooked.  And that's really what Tron has been about since the beginning.  The highest praise Tron ever got was that it was really damn pretty.  "A Technological Achievement."  </p><div class='title'><b>As a movie, it was Okay, but it didn't suck.  That's really the kicker.  Tron Legacy just needs an Okay story underneath to keep itself from ruining the marvelous visuals.</b></div><p>It might need something else though...</p><div class='title'><b>Tron's Legacy</b></div><p>Tron is not an easy movie to find.  Netflix does not have it on Instant Streaming, AND it no longer offers the discs.  If you turn to Half.com and Ebay, you'll only find copies of the DVD going for much more than you'd spend on a DVD these days.  They haven't released it on Bluray, but I expect the probably will when Tron Legacy does.</p><p>I watched it by downloading a torrent, but it ended up having an Italian dub over the dialogue.  Thank God the story isn't that complicated.  I knew what was going on thanks to Wikipedia's synposis.</p><p><b>I think having detailed knowledge of what was going on in the first movie is pretty important to understanding everything in Tron Legacy.</b>  Otherwise, the visuals won't be enough to dazzle you, and the movie will fall flat.</p><p>If you haven't seen Tron since you were a kid, name 3 or 5 things you remember from the film.  These things would probably include Jeff Bridges, Light Cycles, Disc Throwing, the Big Red Spinning Head Thing, and the whole landscape inside of the computer.</p><p>You probably don't remember the part about CLU dying at the beginning.  Or why or how Flynn even got into the computer.  Or that Flynn never uses his Disc once, in fact I think he drops it halfway through the film.  Or that Tron is a security program.  Or who Alan Bradley is.</p><p>Anyways, Good Luck finding a copy of Tron to watch.  You can't even go to Blockbuster now.  Maybe Family Video might have a copy?<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/38">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/36">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
