| December 16, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This semester has really flown by.. It seems that just the other day we were beginning school and there were a ton of games coming out on the horizon.. albeit my anticipating games thread from the end of summer: http://www.spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=3265</p><p>Everyone of those games that came out and i actually invested time to play has completely satisfied me. Chaos Field is actually pretty involved now that i've figured out how to play it. I had great memories playing We Love Katamari. Shadow of the Collosus was amazing, even though it got too tedious. DDR extreme 2 had some great new songs, but you had to unlock them. and Gunstar Super Heroes was everybit as good as the original.</p><p>So what is on the horizon now... what are we all looking forward to in our gaming futures.. lemme see here:</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo Gamecube</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Yoot Saito's Odama</b></div><p>Odama was a pretty interesting and innovative concept when i first about it from E3 earlier this year. It's a real-time strategy pinball game, where you use your pinball to destroy the opposing army while you use the Gamecube Microphone to direct your troops to storm the opposing armies gates.</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b></div><p>I've been waiting for this game a long long time and everything i hear about it makes me want it more and more. The game looks simply amazing.</p><p><b>Pikmin 2</b> for cheap</p><p>WHEN WHEN WHEN is this game going to go down in price.. so many retailers still have this game in stock but it refuses to go down in price. It's been out for a year and a half and is STILL $50. GO DOWN IN PRICE ALREADY!!</p><div class='title'><b>Revolution & Hideo Kojima</b></div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that he is in love with the revolution and has big big plans in store for console. He says, "..when comparing all of the next-generations consoles.. the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 are really just the same gaming experience. The Revolution is completely different from the other consoles which makes it very excitiing.." Sounds exciting to me.. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Sony Playstation 2</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence</b></div><p>This is probably my most-wanted Playstation 2 title at the moment. MGS3 completely blew me away with it's amazing story-telling style, well thought out and interesting characters, deep rich enviroments, and excellent gameplay. and recently with it's 39/40 famitsu rating, says that this update makes it near perfect. ebgames.com says it'll come out around mid-march for a cheap $30.</p><div class='title'><b>Rogue Galaxy</b></div><p>I really haven't been all that interested in RPGs at the moment. Maybe the reason is because i don't want to be tied down to a tv in order to play them. After playing the Final Fantasy XII demo, i was actually somewhat interesting in playing that game, but good 'ol Level 5 blows FFXII out of the water with Rogue Galaxy. The graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks very more interactive and fun rather than the stoicism of FFXII. I hope my view on RPGs change in time for this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Okami</b></div><p>I've actually been waiting for this game quite a while as well. Okami features cell-shading in a much different direction than traditional games. It presents hand-drawn calligraphy mixed with animation much like Zelda and Viewtiful Joe. Gamespot says it results in a rich, stylized appearance that they've never seen before.. currently, it's projected to come out stateside by May 2006.</p><div class='title'><b>In the Groove 2</b></div><p>I've been so burnt out on Dance Dance Revolution. This past weekend i tried playing DDR Extreme Japan but i got so completely bored with it, i couldn't force myself to play it anymore.. my saving grace was In the Groove with it's challenging foot charts, but uninspiring music. But i've had a couple ITG songs in my head over the past couple of weeks, so i always like coming back to it over DDR. My wish is that ITG2 will have amazing music to revitalize dancing games for me, so here's hoping ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Microsoft Xbox 360</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Tetris the Grandmaster Ace</b></div><p>Tetris has always been one of my favorites puzzle games and the grandmaster series makes it very difficult to get your way. As you increase in levels, your speed is decreased to compensate for the amount of points you've gotten in the previous level. Tetris the grandmaster has mutliple modes of play as well, including Death Mode where blocks immediately hit the ground with no falling time. There's also an online multiplayer mode for Xbox Live.</p><p>I would buy this game immediately if it came out over here because there has not been a good version of Tetris on a console in a long long time, and Grandmaster is quite challenging.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo DS</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Children of Mana</b></div><p>I've always loved the graphical sytle of the Seiken Densetsu series. I love playing Sword of Mana and Legend of Mana, even though it seems others don't.</p><p><b>Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow</b> for less than $30</p><p>After hearing so much about this game, and playing through Aria of Sorrow for a second time, i really want to get into this game. But it's so expensive and i don't have a DS either.. sigh. I might need to suck it up and buying it for $35 before it's impossible to find.</p><p><b>Sonic Rush</b> for cheap ^_^</p><p>I've heard many good things about this newest 2D Sonic game. Some people say that finally, a true 2D Sonic sequel that brings back all the warm feelings of the Genesis. When i get a DS, this game will definately be in my library.</p><div class='title'><b><u>PSP</u></b></div><p><b>Every Extend Extra</b> (E3)</p><p>This is the spiritual sequel to Rez. Tetsuya Mizuguchi brings his expertise from Lumines and Rez togehter into one musical rhythmic psychadelic package once again. I cannot wait. This will get me to buy a PSP.</p><p><b>I My Me Katarmai</b> (or whatever it's called)</p><p>Katamari always spawns a great gaming experience and with their new portable version, the multiplayer aspect has been the main focus. Should be alot of fun ^_^.</p><p><b>Lumines</b> for cheap cheap cheap</p><p>I love this game, but it's $40 everywhere i go.. sadness.</p><p>________________________</p><p>well that's all i can think of off the top of my head.. I think there's a game on every platform that i'm looking forward to which makes gaming quite various<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-perfect-dark-zero-impressions">Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the past couple of weeks, there has been a steady stream of xbox 360 things in my living room.. First there was a controller, then a memory card, then Perfect Dark Zero, and then tuesday night, there was an Xbox 360.</p><p>I watched my roommate play PDZ a little bit, but i wasn't really all that impressed.. the graphics looked hokey, and the character movements were pretty primitive.</p><p>After my rough day of studying, testing and finishing up projects, and between playing Chaos Field i decided to check it out since it was just sitting there.<br/>________</p><p>The Xbox 360 is differently designed than all other systems i've played before.. including PC games. When you start up the Xbox 360 and it loads a game, the 360 requires a login. the 360, not the game. You can have multiple profiles on one 360, and each profile needn't have Xbox live. But you must be logged in to play games.</p><p>The game uses this profile for saving progress, records and other data, besides the most import use of having an Xbox Live persona. Each account has it's own settings and data for every game played with that profile.</p><p>So unlike PC games, ps2 or gamecube where each person would have a seperate save file for their data, all data is organized by profile, so if you want your stuff, you only need log in the 360 under your name and the system tells the game which file to load for you.</p><p>very impressive. data management is a snap.</p><p>The wireless controllers have a more user-friendly design than the wavebird controllers. Once you start up the machine, you hit the Xbox button on the controller. It'll assign itself to the xbox, and then light up part of the Xbox button showing which player number it is. This is also represented on the front of the 360 showing how many controllers the system recognizes.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what'll happen when you have 2 Xbox 360 consoles next to each other and attempt to register controllers.. I wonder how they solve this problem.</p><p>Aside from that, it REALLY REALLY REALLY annoys me that the Xbox 360 isn't backwards compatible with every Xbox game. I can play Fable, but i can't play Metal Slug 3 or Fatal Frame 2 or Panzer Dragoon Orta or Crazy Taxi 3. worthless... that was my saving grace for buying some of these games. i could play them now on other's xboxes, and later i can play them on my xbox 360. so much for that one.<br/>_________________</p><p>anyways, my roommate is a huge console fps fan, so naturally he picked up the Xbox 360's flagship title: Perfect Dark Zero.</p><p>PDZ is pretty dissapointing in my opinion. This opinion is pretty justified when my roommate came home last night with a copy of Quake 4 to play instead of this game.</p><p>Perfect Dark Zero is exactly the same game it was 5 years ago with alot of graphical upgrades. The AI will not use any clever tactics to try and take you down. An enemy will not think twice of walking into a room that has your gun fixed on the door. Every single time, i can pop outside and fire a clip. Then duck back into the room, and wait for their slow ass to run in the room, stand in front of me and wait a second for me to shoot them dead.</p><p>Not to mention that the character animation is so stoic, it looks like they used the same animation from the Nintendo 64 game. It feels exactly the same in appearance. how lazy can you be....</p><p>so far i've made it up through Mission number 5 at this point, and the story is absolutely cliche and horrible. Joanna is presented as Lara Croft clone with her veteran pal, Joe, presented as a Bruce Willis clone. Halo 1 and 2 are FAR more interesting than this game, even they are pretty cliche as well.</p><p>Playing this game is pretty annoying, but it's rather addicting at the same time..</p><p>The graphics haven't blown me away at all... there have been some things i've stopped to look it and thought, "that's looks pretty neat.." But then i turn away and get back to the mission. Most of the graphics are have pretty standard for Playstation 2, but the powerful lighting effects of the Xbox 360 pull everything together to give it a clean crisp shiny look.</p><p>On occasion though, the lighting effects look really hokey. Especially when you're infiltrating this chinese palace covered in snow. The snow gives off a blue hue in the moonlight night, but the orange from the fire defuses the reality and makes the enviroment look CG.<br/>____________</p><p>anyways... Perfect Dark Zero thus far has been pretty unimpressive, but it's still kinda fun.. from the purchase of Quake 4, it obviously won't hold over my roommate until Halo 3 comes out next year sometime.</p><p>I'd like to see some great games on the machine though. Fable 2 should be amazing. I really hope they bring Tetris the grand master stateside. I also look forward to Ninety-Nine Knights, Blue Dragoon, and a few other games.. maybe even Final Fantasy XI and Rumble Roses XX.</p><p>The Xbox 360 is pretty well designed, but it feels more like an Xbox 1.5 than a whole new system. The Xbox 360 graphics don't look ALL that better than the Xboxes.. for the time being, anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to News and Recent Shmups" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/news-and-recent-shmups">News and Recent Shmups</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As the weeks continue to wash on by our lives, and the year almost comes to a close, my list of anticipated games becomes less anticipation, and more realization. Most of these games have come out and i have had a great time with ^_^.</p><p>Yesterday, another one of these gems finally came out: <b>Chaos Field</b> for the gamecube. Chaos Field is an updated port from the Dreamcast version which came out exactly one year ago.</p><p>Like most modern shooters, Chaos Field has it's own little quirks and variations on the genre. Many of these quirks are reminiscent of Ikaruga. After destroying enemies, energy cubes with fall from the foe that will fill up your energy meter to the side of the screen. You can use your energy meter for 2 different types of attacks. One attack will lock onto your enemies and attack them with a seeking ray. The other one, though, is shield that will absorb bullets around you.</p><p>One of the more basic maneuvers of your ship, besides firing bullets, is using your sword. The sword can attack your opponent, but also absorb all standard bullets around you, which doesn't make bullet dodging particularly easier.</p><p>The real joy of Chaos Field is change. When beginning a level and in standard combat, you are fighting in the Order Field. At, roughly, any point in time, you change this from Order to Chaos. All of your attacks and defenses become more powerful, however the enemy's attacks become far more rampant. Attacks are more various than in order, hence the name.. chaos. With this addition to the gameplay, you are really playing two different versions of the game.</p><p>You can choose between 3 different ships with very different attacks. Hal's ship is the standard bullet firing ship, which has a static shield for defense. Isumi's ship has some very weak homing lasers, and rotating fire balls for defense. (and) Jinn's ship has a very powerful yet infrequent energy blast.</p><p>Much like modern shooters, Chaos Field awards big points to those who use the combo system correctly. In order to rack up combo points, you must use your energy defense and attacks very frequently to destroy your opponent.</p><p>It's pretty fun, but what really annoys me about the game is each stage is just a solitary boss. For each part of the stage, you're just damaging the boss, bit by bit, until it's completely destroyed. There are no lackies that you can easily destroy, or difficult stage that you must venture through in order to reach the boss. It just all boss fights. oh well.</p><p>The graphics aren't really mind-blowing. In fact, they aren't really mind-blowing for Dreamcast graphics.. They are pretty standard graphics that the Nintendo 64 could probably handle. In one instance, during the second part of the first stage, you're flying right next to a building while battling another ship. The textures for this building is black with bright blue lights indicating windows, which considerably gets in the way of dodging bullets of the same color. I almost get a headache trying to focus on the bullets in front of this background.. luckily i'm not seizure prone.</p><p>but.. as stated above, it's pretty fun and quite challenging. I wouldn't recommend this anyone, though. I'd give it a <font color="red">3 out of 5</font>. If you want a shooter on the gamecube, you need not look further than Ikaruga. However, if you're a fan of shooters, be sure to check it out. ^_^ It's a mere $30 at your local gamestop.</p><p>I'm pretty satisfied with it. In most instances, a Shooter is a Shooter is a Shooter.<br/>____________________________</p><p>As mentioned above the original Chaos Field came out on Dreamcast on Dec 14, 2004 in japan, which might be surprising.. The dreamcast is pretty well dead, but thanks to hardcore shooter fans it still breeds new life. Chaos Field is not the dreamcast's final game though..</p><p>Just this past April, Trizeal was released on the dreamcast as well. Ironically enough, it's limited release outsold a very bad PSP game released on the same day.</p><p>http://spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=2947</p><p>News from a few days ago, indicated that even Trizeal will not be the dreamcast's final game.. Milestone, the creators of Chaos Field, have another shooter coming to the short-lived system. Radilgy will be released on February 16th, 2006.</p><p>Unfortuantely it's very difficult to find information on this game, but from a few screenshots it looks cell-shaded?.. :shrugs:<br/>____________________________</p><p>This news was pretty neat ^_^ and it reminded me of an article i read several weeks ago that caught my eye.</p><p>Alfa Systems announced that Shikigami no Shiro III (Castle Shikigami III) has been in development for a while and will be released in Japanese arcades by February 2006. Alfa Systems has developed all 3 shikigami no shiro games, and also developed Elemental Gearbolt.</p><p>Shikigami no Shiro is a pretty standard shooters with it's own little quirks as well. It has coined the phrase Bullet Hugging, where if your character comes within a certain range right next to a bullet, their attacks become twice as strong.</p><p>The shikigami series is probably known to have the worse localization of any game to date thanks to XS games. Back in 2003, they got their hands on the NA distribution rights to Gunbird and Shikigami 1. They completely gutted the games and slapped on a new title for these completely unrelated games. Gunbird was now Mobile Light Force on playstation, and Shikigami 1 was now Mobile Light Force 2 on playstation 2. In Shikigami, all the cutscenes and character defining traits were taken out of the game, leaving only the core gameplay. With a new name, the game was given an "appriopriate" cover art...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" /></p><p>compared to..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" /></p><p>horrible... ugh.</p><p>but XS games had learned the error of their ways when getting the NA distribution rights to Shikigami 2 and released it with everything in tact, including horrible voice acting.<br/>__________________</p><p>anyways.. i'll bring Chaos Field to the LAN party tonight for people to check out.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Updates?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/event">Updates?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I asked Tom, the pharmacist, "Why did a product that was clearly for humans need to be labeled 'human'?  Is there some specific animal insulin or...?"  "No no.." he replied.</p><p>Up until around 1991, the pharmacuetical industry used animal insulin injected into humans.  Mostly from farm animals such as cows and pigs.  It worked, but it wasn't perfect.  Numerous times, the diabetic's body would attack parts of the insulin that didn't match with our DNA resulting in an unsightly pocket underneath the skin.</p><p>With advancements of cloning, insulin culturers began to grow human bacteria and used them to produce actual human insulin. This is the insulin we know and use today to help balance levels within diabetics, and is why the box specifically said Human on it, rather than Pig or Horse.</p><p>The new insulin is a perfect match to our DNA structure with no side effects from the cloning process. So, they've been steadily phasing out the old barnyard insulin for the past decade or so since the cloned insulin is nearly flawless.  </p><p>Everyday advancement in the pharmacuetical industry is made, as chemical compounds in drugs are refined and condensed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Harry Potter #6" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/harry-potter-6">Harry Potter #6</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I got to Batman Begins somehow, and from there went to Christian Bale to check out his movies.  Besides the movie listing, there was a picture of him from the movie Equilibrium, a movie that i have never heard of, so i checked it out.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" /></p><p>The description compared it to the Matrix and Brave New World, says that it was a futuristic thriller where society is the enemy.  This sounded pretty good, so i went out to Best Buy and picked up a copy.</p><p>Bad Move.</p><p>While Equilibrium sounds pretty good on the surface, i was quite disappointed with the results.  All the promo's on the DVD jacket stated that it's gun fighting techniques were top-notch, however in execution, the were too over-the-top, set to horrible background music, and just looked goofy.  This movie prides itself on it's gun fighting, but there's not enough of it, and it's awkward in execution.</p><p>The story of Equilibrium is set in the future, when society has developed a drug to supress emotions in humans, since emotions are what triggers conflict, war, etc.  Society has a team of police that hunt down anyone not taking the drug, and they also destroy anything that has to do with emotion.  The future is completely black and white.  Sounds pretty pretentious.</p><p>What was really disappointing was the acting.  or perhaps it was acted so well, that Christian Bale perfectly executed the dull process of a emotion-less tool into a senseful human.  Christian Bale himself is pretty emotionless in his acting in the first place..  perhaps he wasn't the best choice.</p><p>Christian Bale is an interesting fellow, though.  I hardly EVER hear about him at all, yet he has a little cult following known as Bale-heads.  He's extremely buff yet acts in B movies, aside from Batman Begins.  American Psycho was the only other movie i remember him being in that i have actually seen, and ever then i didn't ever know his name.</p><p>anyways..  the story was par, i'd say.  there were too many plot twists at the end that made it unbelievable, not that the story wasn't pretty far-fetched in the first place.</p><p>I really should have rented this movie if i wanted to see it..  oops.  It puzzled me why there wasn't a copy at any of the used movie stores i went to, and i have come to the conclusion that no one bought the movie in the first place..  They must have rented it instead.</p><p>Though i still kinda like Christian Bale, i think i'll check out <b>The Machinist</b> next.  apparently, in preparation for the movie he lost 63 pounds to fit the role, and then after shooting he gained it back for the Buffed up Bruce Wayne.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Akira Capsule Figures" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/akira-capsule-figures">Akira Capsule Figures</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Here are the Series 2 figures, which i got today:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">Lady Miyako<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/miyako_1.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">Tetsuo (Early Chapter 6)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_control_1.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">Kaneda (Sitting)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kaneda_sitting_3.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">Kei (Alley Scene)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/kei_1.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">Tetsuo (End of Chapter 3)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/akira/tetsuo_chap3_4.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I love those last two figures, especially Tetsuo.

Amazing detail packed into such a tiny package. You don't really notice from the pictures, but none of these figures exceed 3 inches. I think that Tetsuo Chapter 3 figure is the longest.</p><p>I loved these figures from the start, but I only recently found out that Master Japanese Figure Company Kaiyodo is partially behind these beautiful figures. When it comes to anime figures, you cannot go wrong. Check them out at <a href="http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/" title="http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/">http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/</a></p><p>Man, their figures are awesome. If they started doing Berserk figures... oh man, I'd be broke.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/78">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/76">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
