Adults usually work all day, and Kids are usually at school all day.  Even when they aren't at their places of business or work, they usually aren't home.  The Japanese usually conglomerate somewhere in the town, rather than each other's homes.  Therefore, they need something to keep them connected with all their friends and business associates.  This is why cell phones are so grand in Japan.  If you don't have one, then you must be tied to a phone somewhere or a computer somewhere to keep in contact with your friends to figure out what's up.  You'd be stuck in your tiny apartment or house waiting for something to happen, rather than walking around the town getting something done.  This is also why the Japanese people leap until mobile technology faster than in the US.</p><p>The Japanese use their cell phone as their primary communications device.  More Japanese connect to the Internet through their phone, than on a computer, and more Japanese send emails back and forth from their phone, rather than calling each other.  Whether on a train, on a bus, or just walking, you can easily see most pedestrians typing away with one hand on their cellphone.</p><p>Since cellphones are so widely used, the market for making phones is probably the largest technological market in Japan.  If you walk into any electronic department store, you'll be bombarded with their cellphone area almost right away.  There are 3 main cellphone companies in Japan: DoCoMo, Soft Bank, and Au.  Their stand-alone stores are almost just as common as convenience stores.</p><p>The phone company i went with was Soft Bank, and purely because of their options.  I was looking for a prepaid phone, so that limited my choices to Au and Soft Bank right away.  Now these companies don't have prepaid only models.  They have prepaid plans that can go on specific models.  These plans usually nerf all but a few options for the phone.  The prepaid plan for the Au phones nerf almost all the options, and only allow the user to email other Au users.  The prepaid plan for Soft bank phones pretty much did the same, except allowed emailing to any email address.  Well that narrowed down the choices pretty fast.  So i got a slick looking Soft Bank phone.</p><p>Anywho...  each store has a vast variety of different cellphones you can choose from.  Some vary in options, but every single cellphone is complete with the internet, emailing, and an infrared sensor.  Most phones have cameras, and most phones have marginally large hard-drives for playing mp3s.  Another such model actually has an antenna  for catching TV receptions.</p><p>Whenever you come across some poster advertisement in Japan, you'll probably notice a square barcode like design printed with it.  Well, that's just one of the many uses of the infrared sensor.  You can set the sensor to capture, and point your phone at this barcode.  The barcode acts as a URL when it's received by your phone, and will automatically bring you to a website from the advertisement.</p><p>McDonalds makes full use of this technology by stamping one on each of it's product's wrappers.  You can scan the wrapper's barcode, and it'll bring you to a webpage detailing the nutritional information of what you're eating.  pretty handy.</p><p>The other main use of the infrared sensor is to send contact information back and forth between other cellphones.  This skips the whole process of asking what someone's phone number is, and then tediously typing it into your phone.  The sender can just send the info across infrared and the receiver can capture this information effortlessly.</p><p>In Japan, my cellphone and a pocket map were my two main pieces of equipment (besides id and money) in order to get around and do things without being tied down to anywhere.</p><p>___</p><p>In contrast, American phones are so damned primitive.  It's like beating two rocks together to make fire.  Of course, we don't need anything so helpful in our society because we're usually home.  You could just call their house.  With cellphones, in America, now you can call the person directly, but you wouldn't want to email said person, because they are more than likely driving around since everything is so far apart.  Internet?  That's what computers are for.</p><p>As bitched about before, American cellphones annoy me.  Though, despite being annoyed by my own phone on occasion, the auspicious Cingular 8525, it actually acts as a very nice Japanese phone, even though it's not cool looking and somewhat heavy.  It can do internet and email just fine, but the one thing i played with last night has sold me on it. (even though, i already bought and paid for it)</p><p>The 8525 actually has one of these infrared sensors on it, so i wondered if my American phone could talk with my Japanese phone.  An interesting experiment, indeed.  I turned on my Japanese phone and sent a contact over through infrared...  huzzah. My American phone captured the information and actually noticed it was a Contact..  It didn't decipher the 'title' of the contact correctly, but all the other information was intact.  I'm actually rather impressed..  I moved most of my Japanese contacts over to my phone in a matter of 20 minutes.  It took about a minute per contact.  Though, it doesn't allow me to enter detailed contact information about myself into the phone without listing myself as a Contact :/  oh well..</p><p>Now my next fun experiment shall be if the 8525 can read Japanese cellphone barcodes and make sense of them...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cellular Wars Part 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cellular-wars-part-2">Cellular Wars Part 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Wednesday, after careful, clear and balanced thought, i just said to myself, "aww fuck it... "  I went into the Cingular store i signed up for the <a href="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp" title="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp">8525</a> phone that i outlined in my <a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars">previous post</a>.  This phone could do quite a bit, but whether or not it had Japanese Language Support and ability to work in Japan were questionable.</p><p>Well on this day, the guy i had been talking with for the past two weeks had those answers.  According to Cingular technical support, the phone does indeed work in Japan.  However, Microsoft does not provide any Japanese Language Support for the phone.  Though, he didn't stamp out the possibility altogether.  His technical guy also explained that with 3rd party software, Japanese Language Support is attainable.</p><p>At this point, the phone was pretty much complete and i really didn't want to wait another 2 or 3 weeks of careful, clear and balanced thought before i decide to come back here and probably get it anyways.  So i bought it..  huzzah.</p><p>But now i have this phone which is basically a laptop.  It has Microsoft Office on it for god sakes.  As i held it in my hands i thought to myself..  "ok.. this is just a little bit too much.  I don't need all of this..  why in the hell WOULD anyone need this amount of stuff on their phone unless they didn't have a laptop."</p><p>Buying something so grossly over-kill felt dirty..  i mean, if the thing wasn't a phone, it would be useless to me.  i was going against my cheap ass nature, into a realm of wasting money.  It feels like their had to be a cheaper sleeker alternative.  or something of that nature.  latching on unpolished technology is always a waste of money.  But whatever..  i can afford it, so where's the harm really.  I want a phone that can utilize Japanese and this is what is available to me.  :shrugs:  Later on in the evening, i started playing around with the phone.  Adding in contacts, setting up features..  It really wasn't all that bad...  I could get used to using it.</p><p>The next day, i decided to take it for a test run.. ya know,  Carry it around with me and see how it feels.  Hell, if it obstructs my daily comfort level, the thing has got to go.  Honestly, it's pretty comfortable.  I don't know how big you think it looks from the picture on their site, but it's just as big as my little wallet.  The phone i was borrowing from my mom is bigger in 2 out of 3 dimensions..  Of course, this thing is far more fragile than my mom's beast of a phone.</p><p>The 8525 had passed my comfort level test, so i guess it'll stay.  Now i bring down the whole gadgety feel of the phone to a personalized level and it'll work out just great.</p><p>I began looking for some phone software on the Internets of all places..  After typing in "Windows Mobile 5.0 Japanese", the first hit was what i was looking for: <a href="http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php" title="http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php">http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php</a> Mobem Technologies had created Chinese and Japanese support for my operating system.  Huzzah...  I haven't gotten around to ordering it yet though :/   The next thing i need to find it some weather application to tell me how fricken cold it is outside.</p><p>Another feature of the 8525 is that it connects to WiFi connections.  In fact, it'll search automatically for them, which is pretty funny.  It usually makes a sound when it finds one, but when it's on silent, it'll vibrate.  So when i'm driving down the street in my neighborhood, it'll vibrate a couple times because of all the secure connections.  How helpful.. ^_^  It's a war-driver's most convenient device.  The war-driving vibration is a little difficult than the phone call vibration, so i don't need to go digging in my pockets while i'm driving every time the thing goes off.  I haven't gotten any mail on my phone yet, so i'm not quite sure if it'll vibrate for that.  I hope it does, though..  I suppose i could test that though...</p><p>Anyways, i guess i'm happy with it, even though when my roommates first saw it they said, "that's a phone?!  guhhh?"  I figure that's going to be a lot of people's reactions ... :/  It needs a more phone-y look.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Crank" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crank">Crank</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>yesterday, i finally got the privilege of watching one of the fall lineups grandest movies: <b>Crank</b>.  Crank stars action-star Jason Statham as a double-crossed hitman.  He's been poisoned and must keep his adrenaline up, or else his heart stops.  The first time i heard of such a movie i thought it was one of the greatest movie concepts i had ever heard.  Over-the-top Action after over-the-top action after over-the-top action.</p><p>And that's exactly what this movie is.  Statham just beats the shit out of so many people, it's ridiculous.  Almost every scene he is in has some element of violence or drugs which fuels the over all adrenaline rush of the movie.  There's a few scenes where he's going through the hospital looking for epinephrine, and randomly pushing over patients for no reason..</p><p>This movie has a sense of humor in that way, but it also knows when it's being retarded.  The first action sequence of the movie features Statham driving through a mall, which is COMPLETE RIPOFF of Blues Brothers, which we just so happened to watch the other day.  The writers knew they were ripping it off, and made sure the audience knew this by adding in the line from Statham, "there sure are a lot shops in this mall."</p><p>It's also rather funny how there is no sense of boundaries at all.  Statham does drug after drug after drug, steals police cars, breaks things.  It's like they put everything bad that some irrate mother would complain about, they put it in and flaunted it.  It's kinda like Grand Theft Auto the movie, but not a movie about the story of GTA, just when you go around killing people and stealing cars for no reason.</p><p>This movie has everything i could've hoped for, but i find difficulty liking it.  It's so fricken Spike TV...  but that's what makes the movie so kickass.  Action, Action, Action for those with no attention span.  this attitude lends itself so well to the movie, since the main characters can't stop at all to figure out what's going on.  He's gotta get revenge before he dies, and if he stops....  Game Over.</p><p>The movie also has no shame when it comes to product placement. Need Adrenaline? Red Bull, Rockstar, and plenty other energy drinks and in there.  You could also say Cocaine, Pot and Nasal Spray fall under the category of product placement too.</p><p>Anywho... i suppose if you haven't seen Crank, you should definately give it a go.  Especially if you think over-the-top action movies are hilarious because the movie does go out of its way several times for a gimmick.  But as for owning it?..  eh..  maybe for the purposes of showing it to others.</p><p>Unfortunately i haven't seen either Transporter movies, so i can't really compare it to those.  For some reason, i have the feeling they are pretty similar to this.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Erebus' first show @ The Clinic, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show">Erebus' first show @ The Clinic, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><em>Prepare yourself for a long winded, poorly written account of trying to find a 'good' American cellphone...</em></p><p>Prior to Japan, i really didn't care that much about Cell phone technology.  In fact, i had been resisting it for some time because i'm stubborn or something.  Over the summer, i borrowed a cell phone and used it quite a bit.  So much so, that i really couldn't even remember why i was putting off the whole cell phone thing.  Who really uses land lines these days anyways?</p><p>In Japan, i quickly learned that owning a cell phone is the only way to keep in contact with all your friends.  A Cellphone in Japan is like Instant Messager in America.  Hmm... the more i think about it, that comparison is pretty solid.  I'll write up that discussion some day.</p><p>Anyways, i like chatting with my friends no matter where i am with a very portable device, SO now that i'm back in America, i'm looking for a cellphone that can do all the fun things a Japanese Cellphone can do.</p><p>My primary wants for a cellphone are: Email, Internet, Compactness, and Japanese Language Support.  By Japanese Language Support, i mean the capibilities of reading and writing Japanese text with the phone.  Then i could read Japanese RSS feeds, but more importantly, send and receive emails from my pals in Nippon.  One of my secondary wants is to have the phone actually work in Japan, as well.<br/>I figured these objectives wouldn't be to difficult to complete.  I'm sure some cellphones would have Japanese language support and still look like a phone.  This'll be easy... ha ha ha.</p><p>Incorrect.  I went to Best Buy a few days after i moved to Madison, and jesus...  I didn't think the selection would be this bad.  Japan has fricken department stores full of hundreds of different cellphones to choose from in 3 or 4 separate colors.  Best Buy had 3 to 5 different cellphones for the 3 big providers: Sprint, Cingular and Verizon.  There's some culture shock for you.  The Best Buy cellular section looked like a rundown bargain basement going out of business sale compared to something you'd see in Japan.</p><p>American cellphones look so retro.  The design was built around the chip-set and innards, rather than designing a neat a cellphone and then figuring out how to fit everything into it.  It's like comparing the DS Fat to the DS Lite.  The DS Fat is horribly ugly and HUGE.</p><p>Anyways.. everyone seemed to like the Motorola RAZR, so i thought this would work out pretty good for me.  After seeing one in front of me, i was pretty turned off.  I didn't realize it was that wide, plus the key pad didn't really appeal to me.</p><p>No cellphone really jumped out at me at all, so i began attacking the situation from a different view point: "What provider should i go with?"  After talking with the Best Buy guy, it seemed that i really had two options to choose from: either Cingular or Verizon.  He showed me the phones they had for both providers and none of them had Japanese Language Support.  He suggested that i go with Cingular since their network is designed in such a way that it might be possible to use one of their phones in Japan.  Well, that sounded like a good path to follow up on.  "Where might i find a Cingular merchant, kind sir?"  "down the road near Wendy's"  "i know where that is!"</p><p>The Cingular store wasn't half bad.  Minus the selection, it's pretty similar to a Soft Bank, AU, or Docomo store in Japan.  Though, Japan cellular phone retailers have a bunch of brochures advertising their fall-line up of phones, and even some brochures for individual phones too.  I think that can be boiled into selection.</p><p>I'm greeted by a Cingular phone rep. to which i explain my cellular wants and desires.  For Japanese Language Support, he said the only phones available with such capabilities were PDA style phones.  Phones that are somewhat expensive, somewhat larger than i'd like, and do far more than what i need.  Such a thing really didn't appeal to me, especially since all the PDA style phones looked really ugly.. like Calculator ugly.  Nothing stood out as totally awesome..  However; he indicated that any language pack could be installed on here since it runs an OS, thus solving my language problem.</p><p>So... at this point, it seemed that if i were to accomplish my primary objective of Japanese Language Support, i need a PDA phone which basically runs a tiny version of Windows.</p><p>I decided to leave with the expectation of looking on the Cingular website for stuff, and further my investigation of Japanese language oriented phones in America.   The next day, i went over to the Verizon store to see if anything stuck out as really neat or amazing.  One phone did kind of catch my eye.   I think it was <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=2686&changingCompletedOrder=" title="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=2686&changingCompletedOrder=">this phone</a>.  It was really shiny, somewhat compact, and fit into my pocket.  Unfortunately, it only had limited web capabilities, and NO Gmail services, aside from having no Japanese Language Support.  I put it on the 'think about it' pile in my head as i left the store.  All of their PDA phones were just as hideous as Cingular's, so i left the store with the same expectation as before..</p><p>I searched around on Google and came across the <a href="http://www.iphone.com/" title="http://www.iphone.com/">iPhone</a>, which is quite beautiful.  Runs an OS, does a bunch of crazy stuff.  It went immediately to the top of my list, since it accomplished everyone of my goals, except connectivity in Japan.  (of course, no other cell phone i found thus far had connectivity)  Perhaps i'll hop aboard the hype-wagon for this piece of equipment, i thought.  I'll be the coolest kid at school, plus be able to chat with my Japanese friends.</p><p>Next, I went on Cingular's website, which had the iPhone right out front, and searched for some contact email to inquire about Japanese capabilities and all that jazz.  When looking for the email, i found the <a href="http://forums.cingular.com/" title="http://forums.cingular.com/">Cingular Support Forums</a>, which had categories ranging from Customer Support to Phone Details to International Capabilities.  I took a look at the International section and found a couple thread of people trying to use their phones in Japan.  Hot Dog, this is what i was looking for.  The thread indicated that <a href="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp" title="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp">Cingular's 8525</a> PDA phone was the only Cingular phone that actually worked in Japan.</p><p>This is because the 8525 uses Tri-UMTS and Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE frequencies to connect to as many networks around the Globe as possible.  America mainly uses GSM, where Japan uses UMTS.  Such networks are completely incompatible with each other, therefore you need a phone that can do both if you want to have your phone work in both places.</p><p>I must've glossed over this phone before because it really wasn't all that hideous compared to other PDA phones.  It stored the keyboard in a sliding manor for compactness and comfortability.  The screen was the larger than all the other PDA phones at Cingular and Verizon.  It's certainly no iPhone, but, if it works in Japan, then that's something the iPhone can't do.  It does pretty much everything else the iPhone does, but doesn't look as cool.  Eh...  i think i'll stay on the iPhone hype-wagon.</p><p>The iPhone is Cingular exclusive (for now), but didn't come out until June.  "Maybe i'll just get some crappy phone now, and then switch over to the iPhone upon its release," i thought.  Matt and I had a couple of iPhone hype moments over the weekend ^_^.  Though, Gage clued me into some other opinions when i mentioned my cellphone plans.  "You might want to look into things a little more..  Some cellphone forums have been dissin' the iPhone left and right saying <b>it has the same capabilities of current phones</b> and <b>it is far over priced for what it's worth</b>."  hmmm..  i should probably look into the full details if there are indeed current phones with similar technologies.</p><p>I continued looking into the 8525, but ran into several dead ends online.  I figured that it was time to see this thing in person.  After work on Monday, i visited the Cingular store again for the pure purposes of doing such things.</p><p>After seeing it in person, it really didn't turn me off as much as the other PDA phones had before.  It was actually smaller than i thought it was..  About the same size as my crappy Nokia phone i'm borrowing at the moment, except a little wider.  The 8525 is also smaller than the iPhone as well.  The screen is larger than all their other PDA phones, not as large as the iPhone screen, though.  It can synch up with Outlook on my PC to keep all my contact information current.  It has Microsoft Office on the phone, so i could write up a term paper... if i had to?  It utilizes WiFi, so when i'm near a wireless network, I can use that to connect to the internet rather than a cellphone tower.  You can also write messages using the touch pad rather than the keyboard, and the 8525 will conform to your writing style.  I also asked the guy about battery life, and he said that if i charge it every night, it'll work out just fine.  Pretty much all this stuff is what the iPhone can do... i think.</p><p>I was pretty impressed with the little thing.  It's like a little laptop.  With a 2 year plan, the phone itself costs $400 and to utilize the Internet and all that jazz it would be $80 a month.  $40 for phone, $40 for internet, and then an extra $36 activation fee.  Yeesh..  that's a bit expensive, but...  i can afford it.  The low-end iPhone costs $500 with a 2 year plan, so with the 8525 i'm saving a little bit of money..</p><p>I inquired about my cheeky plan of starting a plan with a crappy phone, and getting the iPhone upon its release.  "well, if you want to change phones in the middle of your service then you must pay the full cost of the phone w/o rebates or deals or anything.  That'll be like $700 or $800, then."  Eckk.. Well i don't plan on doing that anymore...</p><p>But next i asked the real question..  Can it actually work in Japan?</p><p>After consulting his friend, they came back with a 'no'.  "o rly? this contradicts previous evidence."  We went on over to the computer and researched it a little bit.  I showed him the thread i found on the Cingular forums stated that it was possible..  Though, his employee friend stated that he has a customer who actually tried it and did not have success.  The technical problem was that even though the 8525 utilizes UMTS, the bandwidth isn't high enough to match the 2100hz UMTS network of Japan..  or something like that.  But..  being a nice guy, the clerk replied, "well... lemme look into this a little more.  I'll make some calls and send some emails to people and get a definite answer for you."  "okey dokey..  that sounds pretty good, mate"</p><p>_____</p><p>So that is where i stand at this very moment.  This 8525 is smaller, does pretty much the same stuff, is cheaper (just a little), is available and might actually work in Japan.  The iPhone is prettier, does the same stuff neater, and has larger memory capacities.  I think the big thing is that i'm looking for a cellphone now..  not six months from now.  I don't really plan on using my phone as an mp3 player, either.  (and) i GUESS i could forgo the flashy stuff to have something that looks really buttoned down and business like.</p><p>If the 8525 actually does work in Japan, well holy shit... sign me up.  If it doesn't work, i think i'll probably still go with it anyways.  Even if it doesn't work with the Japanese UMTS network, the Wifi connection should still get me onto the Internet.</p><p>I'll probably be back at the Cingular store on Thursday to pick it up unless i come across any major complaints about it..  I'll certainly need to double check the whole Japanese Language Support functionality with Windows Mobile.</p><p>sigh... So much work for something that seems so simple.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Jury Duty" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/jury-duty">Jury Duty</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>ahh... the joys of trying to get out of jury duty.</p><p>Way back in June last year, my parents got a little notice in the mail from the Court Administration of Hennepin County.  Out of everyone in the county and amongst many others, i was selected to serve Jury Duty.  Well, at the time i couldn't do such a thing since i was living in Madison and working 50 ish hours a week.  I couldn't really postpone it to the immediate future either because i was going off to Japan, which is also not near downtown Minneapolis.</p><p>I called up the jury office and said such things and they asked when i could serve jury duty within the next six months.  I said, "oh i dunno... how about the second week in January or something like that.."  and thus it was written.</p><p>I got back from Japan and putzed around for a while.  The Thursday before i was moving down to Madison to start my new job, my mom reminds me that i had Jury duty on Monday...  which i had completely forgot about.  I probably would've paid more attention to it, had i no plans to try and get out of it again.  So i'm all like, "whatever..  i'll call 'em up tomorrow and tell i can't go. wheee."</p><p>Tomorrow came; i had the day off.  I called them up later in the afternoon to continue my streak of lazy.  "i'm sorry," i say, "but i can't make it in on Monday..  i'm.. uh...  moving down to Madison this weekend and start my job Monday."  Though, this was a bit of a lie.  The monday of my jury duty was January 8th, and the monday of starting my job was January 15th.  "you can't come in on Monday..?  This is a little short notice.  I mean..  we'll need some kind of proof... and...  you haven't even sent in your questionnaire.  can you fax us something that proves you start on Monday?"  "uhhh...  no i can't do that because i don't have any of that with me..  and blah blah blah."  "well can you fax us something on Monday morning when you're at your job?"  "....k"</p><p>So...  now i was in a bit of a pickle.  Caught in a lie to the court, it would seem.  Well, first thing i did was go to their website and fill out that questionnaire.  And.. i planned on going downtown on Monday and saying something like, "oh crap... i got the weeks messed up.  i actually start next week 'n stuff. nurrr."</p><p>Bright and Early, Monday morning, i skipped out of Pharmacy work pretty early, and went downtown to get their at 9am.  I looked all over the letter and figured that 9am was when i was supposed to be there.  I got to the court building, went where i was supposed to and found nothing.  It was pretty empty.  All the doors were closed and looked like nothing was going on.  I walked around the building a little bit and asked information where to go.  They sent me right back to where i was.  There's a big sign that says, "Jury Administration" with an arrow pointing to the door.  I got closer and heard some voices inside.  The door was opened a crack, so i poked my head in and saw a large auditorium filled with about 200 people listening to a lecturer.<br/>"crap..  am i late, or something?" i thought.  I took a look at my letter a little more closely and saw that i was ACTUALLY supposed to get there at 8:15am.  "Well shit..  45 minutes late," i thought, "Screw this.. i'm taking off.  i told 'em i wasn't going to be here anyways."  I got back and emailed Bryan at my job about that proof of employment.</p><p>At this point i figured..  they have the fax about my employment, and i didn't show up, which i told them i wasn't.  eh, i should be fine.  No need to call them and have everything sorted out.  They can call me if they have any problems...  Though, i guess i'll need to get citizenship to Wisconsin to prove i live there.. sigh.</p><p>Well, on Wednesday i got a new piece of mail from the Court Administration of Hennepin County.  "This should be interesting..." i thought, "probably some letter bitching about my absence downtown."  As luck would have it, it was the exact opposite of that scenario.</p><p>The letter stated that after reviewing my questionnaire i had completed, Hennepin County would not need my services for Jury Duty.  So, i guess all that running around was really all for not.  huzzah.  now i don't need to get a Wisconsin Driver's license until i move somewhere less temporary.</p><p>My little brother told me something that day that he heard from some standup comedian.  "There's no way i'd ever commit some huge crime because it puts my life in the hands of 12 people not smart enough to get out of Jury duty."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-2">Twilight Princess (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After playing through Twilight Princess, it really feels like Twilight Princess is the next milestone or progression in The Legend of Zelda series. It adds so much more to the franchise than i thought Wind Waker did.</p><p>As a whole, it feels like there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess. All the other ones feel like side stories.. different takes on the series, in gameplay, setting, and story.</p><p>Anywho... i think one of the main strengths of Twilight Princess is it's nostalgic feel. But, i also feel like that really holds it back at the same time. The 'video-gamey' sound effects really break the reality in my opinion.</p><p>The music is kinda the same way. Some of the best music in the game are newly composed tracks for the dungeons. Some of the later ones have a very wicked unworldly feel. The nostalgic tracks are just the same symphonically composed songs you've heard over and over again. I think they would've been more successful if the old melodies were subtly inserted into newer compositions.</p><p>but..... whatever ^_^.  Twilight Princess is pretty damn amazing.  Certainly worth the wait.</p><p>I should probably order a year of Nintendo Power so i can get the Soundtrack while it's still available... hmmm... i wonder if i could just buy the soundtrack from the nintendo store instead.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 31, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>oh my good lord, i love this game..</p><p>before coming back to the states, i ordered a copy online since they had been several rumors that the gamecube version was going to see a very limited release. of course, upon being in the states, i've seen copies all over the place for gamecube. in fact, it's easier to find on gamecube than on the wii.</p><p>anyways...</p><p>after getting stuck in Portrait of Ruin, i decided to start my game of zelda and i finally put down the controller after 14 hours.</p><p>this game is phenomenal.</p><p>the graphics are beautiful. the charcters, the environments, everything looks amazing.. it is very similar to Shadow of the Collosus, though, actually, shadow has a more realistic natural feel to it. Zelda still retains the cartoony unrealistic feel thanks to character design, which i think takes away from the majestic nature it tries to portrey.</p><p>the story is rather wicked and darker than most other Zeldas, as to be expected from all the hype. The notion of darkness engulfing hyrule is presented with eerie sounds and an ambient supernatural soundtrack. darkness, in the case of twilight princess, is known as twilight, which is where the title derives it's name from. the animation and graphics compliment the sound beautifully.</p><p>link has the most expression out of any previous game. despite that fact he still does not speak on screen, he has an amazing range of emotions that will still convey his dialogue for the story. he shows empathy, disgust, and madness throughout the story, so far, which are emotions i've never felt from a previous zelda game.</p><p>the gameplay is good old legend of zelda style. same old, same old. no jumping. the dungeons and puzzles so far, have been quite entertaining.</p><p>one thing they've added that i've wanted in zelda game ever since Ocarina of Time was a time gauge that told me how long i've played the game.</p><p>anyways... i can't really remember the last time i played a game for 14 hours straight, still wanting more. i only stopped because i was getting hungry, and wanted to eat something a little more substantial than chips.</p><p>after 14 hours through the game i've only made it to the 3rd dungeon. in standard zelda style, they are usually the first 3 dungeons, then you fight something in hyrule castle. After that, something crazy happens to the world, and you must trek through another 8 dungeons. Unfortunately, the 8 dungeons is where Wind Waker failed. though we've been promised by nintendo that there are more dungeons in Twilight Princess than any previous zelda game. that would make Twilight Princess a pretty goddamn long game.</p><p>anyways... i love this game and won't be playing Final Fantasy XII or any other unplayed game sitting on my shelf for a little while longer. wheee</p><p>by the way..  i named link "Billy" and the horse, epona, "Blacky" to experience Twilight Princess in true Crystania fashion.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/78">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/76">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
