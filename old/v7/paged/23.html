Thousands of people come from around Japan, and around the world to view the beautiful festival floats, or yatai, as they are display during the day, and paraded through town at night.  I attended the Spring festival this year, and took a bunch of pictures.  You can view those here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.</p><p>But, if you aren't able to make it to the festivals, there are 2 museums in town that showcase festival floats, and you can view them anytime throughout the year.  There's the Takayama Festival Float Museum (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高山祭屋台会館</span></span>), or Yatai-kaikan for short.  And there's the Hida Takayama Festival "Forest" (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>飛騨高山まつりの森</span></span>), or simply Matsuri no Mori.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>まつりの森</span></span> / Matsuri no Mori</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" /></p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>森</span></span> or mori, means forest in Japanese, though this museum really isn't a forest.  Even the plaque outside the building says, "Takayama Matsuri Museum."  It's located on the south end of town, and sits next two several other museums.  There's the tea ceremony museum, and a butterfly and insect museum.  There's also a playground in the forest behind the museums.  Maybe that's where the forest name comes from.</p><p>But, this place is definitely way more animated than a typical Japanese museum.  And while it looks very very small from the outside, the whole museum is actually house inside of an expanded geo-dome found in the hill. </p><p>As shown below, there's a long hallway dug into the mountain leading to the geo-dome.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" /></p><p>Along the left-side of the hallway leading to the geo-dome are miniature scale replicas of the 11 floats featured in the Autumn Takayama Festival.</p><p>On the right-side, there's some information showing how this museum was built.  There's also information about festival floats and which festivals actually use and display floats.  Apparently, there's only 6 festivals in Japan that actually use these kinds of floats.</p><p>There's the Takayama Festival <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高山祭</span></span> and the Furukawa Festival <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>古川祭</span></span>.  Both of which are (basically) where I live in Gifu, Japan.  Up north, there's the Takaoka Kuruma-yama Festival <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高岡御車山祭</span></span>.  In Kyoto, their Gion Festival <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>京都祇園祭</span></span> uses them too.  To the west of Tokyo in Saitama, the city of Chichibu has a Night Festival <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>秩父夜祭</span></span> with floats.  Apparently, that one has fireworks, too. :)  And finally, there's the Hitachi Nagaremono Festival? <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>日立風流物祭</span></span>.  I dunno.  Anyway, that's what the signs say.</p><p>Along with that information, there are some beautiful golden-lacquered folding screens depicting these festivals.  The Takayama Festival is in the photo above.</p><div class='title'><b>Festival Floats</b></div><p>As you proceed down the hallway, you enter the geo-dome, which houses 6 floats.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7658_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>According to the brochure, these 6 floats are sometimes rotated with other floats.

There is an Inami carving, made from a single zelcova (Keyaki) tree, attached to the base of the float.

He envisioned a float that is "Not only for adults, but, one that children could enjoy as well."  This float was designed with a four-layer structure; something not traditionally seen in Takayama Festival floats.  Its main characteristic is its heavy and sturdy build.  The marionette, positioned on the top level, was made by a Nagoya doll maker (Yorozuya, Nihei).  This marionette will be shown off and on during museum hours.</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="title">6. <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>金鶏台</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>きんけいたい</span></span></div><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7667_stitch_t.webp"></a><br/><p>The rooster on the top of <b>Kinkeitai</b> is a messenger from Ise Shrine.  There is a cock and a hen with three chicks.  Being that the rooster possesses the Five Virtues of "Wisdom, Fighting, Spirit, Courage, Benevolence and Trust," as well as "Family Safety," "Martial Happiness", and "Fruitfullness", this float is an expression of the ideal family.  There is a carving in the shape of a lattice located in the middle and lower levels of the float.  The curtain with a golden cock and peony design on the back of the float, is made with woolen cloth and embroidered with gold and silk thread.</p></div><br/></div><br/><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Marionette displays</b></div><p>About every 10 minutes in Matsuri no Mori, the lights dim down, and several spotlights focus on a particular act.  There are 7 different acts and they perform once every hour.  Here's the following schedule with 9 o'clock as an example:</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>神楽台</span></span> / Kaguratai // 9:00 - 9:04<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>夫婦獅子</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>めおとじし</span></span> / Shishi // 9:08 - 9:15<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>銭太鼓</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ぜにだいこ</span></span> // 9:15 - 9:18<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>金時台</span></span> / Kintokitai // 9:23 - 9:27<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>福寿台</span></span> / Fukujutai // 9:30 - 9:35<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>世界一大太鼓</span></span> / 9:40 - 9:45<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>金鶏台</span></span> / Kinkeitai // 9:50 - 9:55</p><p>I arrived at the museum in the middle of the Zenidaiko dancing, so I was only able to view the last 4.</p><p>As mentioned, in previous articles about festival floats, one of the main attractions of the float are the marionettes attached, and the complicated dances they perform.  Each float's marionette's dance is meant to tell some kind of story and really highlight the meaning behind the float.</p><p>The following photos are from Kintokitai, Fukujutai, and Kinkeitai.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" /></p><p>The Kintokitai dance features a boy either attacking or warding off a bear on the very end of the float.  He dances and spins around, and at the end the bear (or the spirit of the bear) is defeated.</p><p>The Fukujutai dance features a man walking towards a peach and performing its dance.  He moves around, then a man with a cannon emerges from the peach.  That man moves around then fires a bunch of confetti out of the cannon into the crowd.</p><p>The Kinkeitai dance is a little more tame and simple.  It just features the marionette moving to the end of the float, dancing.  Then the man turns into a demon, and continues to dance.  Then he turns back into a human, and completes the dance.</p><p>Also, I watched the <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>世界一大太鼓</span></span>, or The World's Largest Giant Taiko Drum performance.  3 marionettes turn to the drums, and begin beating a song.  It's a little creepy since these marionettes are life size, and they bow before and after the performance, which is a very "human" Japanese thing to do.</p><div class='title'><b>The Museum</b></div><p>Overall, I really like the museum.  I think it shows off the Festival floats and marionette dances really well, and in a unique atmosphere, too.  Though, I think it's just one step away from a Chucky Cheese, or Shony's Pizza Place.  It's all very animatronic, and the spotlights really focus your attention.  There's an announcer that always says what's going on, and how long before the next performance.</p><p>Also, inside the museum is a Crystal Cave, which was closed for some reason.  Maybe it's only open on the weekend, or something.</p><p>Matsuri no Mori is a bit expensive, too, at 1000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.  I think by American standards, that's not too bad, but Japanese museums are usually half that price.  Of course, those museums lack that flare, and experience built into Matsuri no Mori.  This museum is very hands-on, and let's you have fun.  It might be worth the price if there's some kind of package deal that includes all the other museums in the area for a discount price.</p><p>But, I dunno.  I thought it was neat, and there was plenty of good information.  It's certainly more interesting than the Yaitai-kaikan.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Yamada Elementary 山田小" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/yamada-elementary">Yamada Elementary 山田小</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In the Hida region, there's Hida City, Takayama City, Shirakawa Village, and Gero City.  Hida City is directly north of Takayama City.  And it too! had a governmental restructuring in recent years.  </p><p>In 2004, the towns of Furukawa and Kamioka joined with the villages of Kawai and Miyagawa to form Hida City.  There aren't too many schools, either.  There are 2 junior high schools, and 4 elementary.  There's also a combined junior high and elementary.  So, really, technically, there's 3 and 5.</p><p>However, like most of Japan, there used to be more.  Much more!  After the formation of Hida City, they closed a couple of schools and had those students filter into the larger ones.</p><p>One such school is the following: Yamada elementary in Hida City.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" /></p><p>This school is really easy to find.  I didn't even know it was here until I drove by it on the way to Kamioka.  It's directly on the side of the road in the middle of the Yamada neighborhood of Kamioka Town.</p><p>I'm guessing that it closed within the last 10 years, though.  The building isn't really falling apart.  Looking through the windows, there's plenty of crap piled up, and some things were simply left there without any thought.</p><p>The gym is still in use.  In fact, the plaque in front now states Yamada School Gym, rather than Yamada Elementary.  The school yard was still being used for baseball practice, too.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka &quot;Big&quot; Festival 神岡大祭" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-big-festival">Kamioka "Big" Festival 神岡大祭</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

There are plenty of castles in Gifu prefecture.  And Takayama has a former castle site, where you can hike.  Furukawa has a former castle site, too.  But, I'm pretty sure, Kamioka Castle in the only standing castle in the Hida region.</p><p>Kamioka Castle is located on the top of the one of the hills (or mountains) in town, and overlooks the entire downtown area.  It's right next to the Kamioka junior high school.

It's one of the center-most places in Japan, and on the west-end of Japan's most major mountain range.  The municipality of Takayama makes it the largest city in Japan based on land area.  9 years ago, it absorbed many of the neighboring villages in a governmental restructuring.  Many of these villages are nothing but mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods.</p><p>Takayama has about 90,000 residents.  Of that population, about 65,000 live in the central Takayama City, which is where I live.</p><p>I live at the northeastern base of one of the more prominent mountains in Takayama, Kita-yama.  At least, I think that's the name.  From my apartment, when I walk into the center of town, whether it be for drinking, or taking the train elsewhere, I have to go around the mountain one way or the other.</p><p>Recently, I've been taking a different route.  The path that leads straight up the mountain, and back down the other side.  It's much faster saving about 5 minutes.  And it's great exercise, too. :)</p><p>From Kita-yama, you have a great view of the entire downtown area.  Every time I walk past this amazing view, I can't help but take photos, even though they're the same ones I've taken several times before.</p><p>So, here you are.  There are photos I've taken from the early morning, mid-day, the evening, the sunset, and at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Downtown Takayama</b></div><p>(These are all panoramic shots, too, so you

recognize.</p><p>In these two close-ups you can see the gate of Hachiman Shrine.

It's where all the government in Takayama operates.</p><p>Between the two, landmarks is a white rectangular building.  That's one of the elementary schools I teach at, Nishi ES.  It actually has very few students.  Which may seem a bit weird being near the center of town, but there are a few other elementary schools nearby that cover the larger areas.

When you take a look at the macro view of the stores, and shops, it certainly looks like it could be in the 1950s.  But when you start looking at things a little closer, I think they have some of their decades mixed up.</p><p>The electronic stores has several camcorders that were clearly from the 70s.  I don't even think Sony started making commercial camcorders until the 70s.  There's also plenty of cameras from years later than the 50s.  The TVs looked really old, though. :)</p><p>The toy store has a poster of Super Mario Bros, which is clearly 80s.  And some of the other goofy stuff in that toy shop which probably from that same decade, too.</p><p>There's plenty of wrestling posters, too.  I think that was also in the 80s.  I think when wrestling started getting HUGE in the US, it's popularity in Japan was equally huge.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6312_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6302.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6301.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6301.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6301.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6301.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140503_showa_hall/IMG_6301.webp"/></p><p>Upstairs in Showa Hall, they have some private home setups, and a recreated classroom.

All of the museums I've visited focus on ancient Japan, or war-torn Japan.  The ancient history museum exhibit lacquerware, pots, tools, and artifacts from 100 or more years ago.  Or they're about Shogun and Samurai, and the warring states period of constant battle.  It's a past that I have absolutely no earthly connection to at all.  It's all very primitive, and it seems like a time I personally cannot relate to.  I'm not uninterested by it, but I can really relate to it.</p><p>Japanese war museums are interesting, too.  And… World War II wasn't THAT long ago…  but I've never been in a Japanese museum that focused on post-war Japan.  Showa Hall features many things that are still quite in the past, but it's all the building blocks of today's society.  All of the items in this museum are still used today in their modern equivalent.</p><p>I feel like this museum is a missing link between all those ancient history, and war museums and the modern age, today.  It fills a gap that I hadn't seen before.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Fresh Start (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start-2">A Fresh Start (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A dream that I've had for many many years.  Throughout those years, I had many ideas, wants and desires, but never had the motivation to put them into code.</p><p>2 months ago, in the midst of finalizing classes for the year, and being monstrously busy with all kinds of nonsense, I had the urge to put this together.  Everything was so clear in my head.</p><p>It's one of those moments, where you feel the weight of your To-Do list, and just can't bring yourself to do anything on it.  That moment when your mind wonders, and you think about something else you could be doing.  Something equally constructive, but way more fun.  For that day, I didn't want to do anymore lesson planning, and I missed Software Development enough.</p><p>At that moment, it was time for me to finally do this.</p><p>It was time to finally rewrite theschlock.com as its own application with all of my own code, and design.</p><p>And on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th</a>, the new theschlock.com was running on line for the first time.  Today, it's finally (basically) finished!</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>2 years prior, I had already created a Tapestry 5 project that ran in Jetty completely standalone from anything I had at Widen.  And I had things already organized for where I wanted to start adding classes.  </p><p>From the beginning, I knew that I wanted to write this site in Java using Tapestry 5 and Hibernate.  They were technologies I was used to.  Much of the work I did at Widen was on the backs of others smarter than me that had already built systems for others to use.  I wanted to learn how to use these technologies from scratch to better understand how they work.</p><div class='title'><b>Code Decisions</b></div><p>On the back end, there were several other decisions that I had made WELL before any code was written.</p><p>1.  This site will not have comments.  </p><p>At least, nothing internal.  I learned a long time ago from MovableType and Wordpress that any web form left unattended will get massively spammed by bots, and who knows what else.  (In the future, I might add Facebook comments if I can fit them into the design.)</p><p>2.  Further than that!  This site will only have read access to the database.</p><p>I did not want to deal with security in any manor for this site.  Nothing on the Internet is every truly secure, and anyone who would want to tear into my database has way more time, and expertise on their side.  Any wall is just an invitation, so why have any walls in the first place.  And, if I did have security, I would probably just mess it up.</p><div class='title'><b>Road Blocks</b></div><p>In any project, you'll hit a road block.  You'll come across something you don't understand, or a problem you just can't figure out.</p><p>When it's a personal project, it is very easy to just call it quits.  You're the only person on the project, and you are really the only person that cares about the outcome.  If you call it quit, it really only affects you.</p><p>Maybe it's been all those years at Widen dealing with road blocks on a daily basis, or maybe I'm just more comfortable with writing code than I was in college, or maybe I'm just more grown up now, too, and experienced.</p><p>Any road blocks I came across with this project were eventually overcome.  Any problem, or misunderstanding just took a little bit of patience, time, and (sometimes) research to think it through and figure out a solution.</p><p>Figuring out Hibernate was easy.  (Though, tapestry does all the work.)  Implementing LessCss wasn't really difficult either.  Getting tomcat running, and setting things up on a new host took some time, but I just needed to read through documentation, and chat with tech support for my host.  Figuring out how to get Japanese text working in the database took a little while, too.</p><p>Nothing was outside of my ability, and I was able to do everything I wanted.</p><div class='title'><b>Back Up</b></div><p>Theschlock.com is really just a mirror of what I have locally.  <b>I never have to worry about losing something online</b> because it's just a copy.  All the code is stored on <a href="http://github.com/dyreschlock" title="http://github.com/dyreschlock" title="http://github.com/dyreschlock">Git Hub</a>, so I'll never lose it.</p><p>Every time I make a new post, I insert it into my local database directly with no interface.  To deploy those changes online, I make a backup, and then restore the online database with the backup.  This is AMAZING because it ensures that I will always have a backup of my data, and that the backup works!  I put every backup into my Google Drive, so I'll never lose that data either.</p><p>All my photos for theschlock.com are on both Google Drive, and my web server.  Even if all that data is lost on the server, I can just upload everything again from Google Drive.</p><p>Every time I make changes to my site, I'm redeploying it in a way that could be done any web host, not just the one I'm using now.  </p><p>This sense of security is something I NEVER had with Wordpress, or any blog software for that matter.  If any of those blogs died, everything I worked on would be gone forever.  I never have to worry about that with this approach.  Every aspect of this site is backed up, and will never be lost.  (Unless github and google are lost.)</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Writing code is pretty easy.  You just need to keep things organized, simple, and then make sure they work.  <b>Design</b> is much different beast, and a very easy road block to kill this whole project.  I haven't done much design work in the last 7 years.  And there were many times when I would design something on paper, and it would look terrible after its implementation.</p><p>The Wordpress design I had before wasn't too bad, but I didn't want the side bars.  I knew what I wanted, and those translated into User stories easily, and then to Tapestry Pages from there.</p><p>1.  The index page would be the most recent post on the site.<br/>2.  The post must be the most prominent thing on the page.<br/>3.  No side bars.  Only show the post.<br/>4.  The site must translate to mobile well.<br/>5.  Keep it simple stupid.</p><p>Like usual, my design from scratch looked like garbage.  As dumb as it sounds, searching for "good blog designs" on google gave me a lot of inspiration. :)  </p><p>I paged through a couple articles highlighting the best of the web and came across <b>Dan Cederholm's</b> website: <a href="http://simplebits.com/" title="http://simplebits.com/" title="http://simplebits.com/">Simple Bits</a>.  Holy shit, this guy's design was beautifully simple.  It hit all 5 points of my check list, and was very sharp.</p><p>I went to work using the top-down approach and the site pulled itself together pretty easily.  After my initial implementation, I had my friend <a href="http://www.mlatzke.com/" title="http://www.mlatzke.com/" title="http://www.mlatzke.com/">Matt Latzke</a> take a look at it.  He suggested that I add a lot more spacing between components, and choose a second complimentary font for titles, and things.</p><div class='title'><b>Fonts</b></div><p>My favorite serif font is Garamond.  I've been using Garamond for my resume, term papers, and almost anything I've typed since my beginning days in college.  I wanted something better than Times New Roman, and Garamond just has a sleek simplicity to itself.  I don't know, I can't really describe it.</p><p>Matt suggested that using Garamond for absolutely every piece of text on the site was design overkill.  I didn't think it looked too bad, but having only one font did make the site feel a bit…  I dunno…  sheltered?</p><p>Anyway, I went to google again, and searched for good complimentary web fonts for Garamond.  Helvetica came up a bunch, but I didn't really like the way it looked with Garamond.  Eventually, I came across Gill Sans.  When bolded, it really stood out against Garamond.  It had very fat, but clean letters.  Very stylish, and different.</p><div class='title'><b>Archives</b></div><p>One other strong point I wanted for this site was the ease of getting to past posts, and finding everything on the site with only a few clicks.  I really hate Wordpress's pages for categories and archiving.  I want my users to be able to see everything, and find everything, and view it all in a small space.</p><p>My initial designs were terrible again, but thanks to Ray at Widen, he sent everyone a link to site with an amazing design: <a href="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html" title="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html" title="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html">Rob Ashton's Blog</a>.  This site is so incredibly simple.  If I had seen this 2 months ago, theschlock.com would probably look different.</p><p>For the archives…  Shit, just dump out all the post titles on the page and line 'em up.  Nothing is more simpler than that!</p><p>I wanted to have some featured posts, too, and display an image to draw the user in.  I really like how <a href="http://www.theverge.com" title="http://www.theverge.com" title="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a> handles their recent posts on the category pages, highlights posts with images, and still keeps the design nice and clean.</p><p>I started doing something like that, but those highlighted posts naturally fell to the side of the categories and post titles.  Everything just fit together that way.</p><div class='title'><b>(Basically) Finished</b></div><p>Figuring out the design for the archive and category pages was really the last unfinished feature.  With that now complete, theschlock.com is (basically) finished!  Obviously, I'll probably change a few things here and there down the road, but this is it.</p><p>The site does pretty much everything I ever wanted, and I'm in complete control of all aspects.</p><p>"It's the [website] I've always wanted, and now I have it.  I rule!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hanami in Takayama 花見" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hanami-in-takayama">Hanami in Takayama 花見</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Sakura trees were already in full bloom when I visited Nagasaki 4 weeks ago, and now that it's getting warm in Takayama, they've begun to bloom here, too.</p><p>Taking apart the word <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>花見</span></span>, we have <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>花</span></span>, or Hana, which means flower, and <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>見</span></span>, or mi, which is watching, looking, or viewing.  So <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>花見</span></span>, or Hanami, literally translates as Flower Viewing, but refers more directly to observing, and enjoying Sakura trees as the reach full bloom.</p><p>Earlier this week was probably the peak of Sakura season, but it wasn't until yesterday that the weather was actually good enough to go outside and enjoy the beautiful trees with a bright sunlit sky.</p><p>The next few photos are from some of my elementary schools in Takayama.  I took some photos during the lunch recess while all the students were running around.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" /></p><p>They looked perfect last week, but they still look just as beautiful today.  Though, they have started to lose their flowers.  When the wind blew today, it was a snow storm of petals.  I was still finding petals hidden in my clothing a couple hours after walking around.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>臥龍桜</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>がりゅうざくら</span></span></b></div><p>In the village of Miya, there stands a Sakura tree that is over 1100 years old.  </p><p>According to Wikipedia, for the longest time it was referred to as <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>大幢寺の大桜</span></span> (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>だいどうじ</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>の</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>だいさくら</span></span>), or The Daijou Temple's Big Sakura Tree, but in 1931 the temple's priest renamed it to <b>Garyuuzakura</b>.  You might remember from a previous post that <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>龍</span></span>, or ryuu, is Japanese for dragon.  The kanji <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>臥</span></span>, or ga, means bending down, or bowing.  </p><p>The priest renamed the tree Ga-ryuu-zakura because the expanding branches of the trees looked like a winding dragon.  And with the tree being so old, many branches give the appearance of bowing.  So I think the name Bowing Dragon Sakura makes sense. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" /></p><p>Above is a beautiful tree from directly in front of the Miya station entrance.</p><p>Garyuuzakura is right next to the train station in Miya, which has plenty of parking.

That sounds like a park to me.  It's just an open space surrounded by lines of Sakura trees.  </p><p>I don't think it particularly photographs well, but it's a nice relaxing walk. :)  Plus!

Once dusk turns to night, the paper lanterns and other lights are turned on, and it turns the forest into a beautiful wonderland of nature.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5844.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5844.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5844.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5844.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5844.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5831.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5831.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5831.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5831.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5831.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6144.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6144.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6144.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6172.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6172.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6172.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6172.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6172.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6189.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6189.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6189.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6189.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6189.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6193.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6193.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6193.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6193.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_6193.webp" /></p><p>Again, thank god for the perfect weather we had yesterday and today.

They beat on their neighborhood's drum, climb to the top of the pole attached to it, and suspend their bodies to display their support for their neighborhood as the best.</p><p>The Okoshi Daiko is a massive drum carried by the neighborhood's men.  Thousands of residents led the parade through the streets of Furukawa holding lanterns and lighting the way for the Okoshi Daiko.  The Daiko continues to thunder through the neighborhoods and the hundreds of drunk men behind continue to yell and scream.</p><p class='img'><img
