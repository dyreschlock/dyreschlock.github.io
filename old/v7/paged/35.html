| November 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight, I was in Minneapolis for Chuck Palahniuk's second to last stop on his tour promoting his newest novel, <b>Damned</b>.  Damned is about a 13 year old girl, named Madison, who dies.  And she must accept the fact that she's dead, and goes through the grieving process.  Damned is the first book in a triology.  The following 2 books are still in process and titled <b>Doomed</b> and <b>Delivered</b>.  Apparently she goes from hell (Damned) to purgatory (Doomed) to heaven (Delivered).</p><p>I haven't had a chance to read Damned just yet, but it seems that Chuck and Double Day are promoting Damned much more than his other recent novels.  Perhaps that's because it's a series of books and they need to start strong.  Chuck has done interviews in many of the popular and niche magazines out there.  Including in an article for Minneapolis' own premiere newspaper, The Star Tribune.</p><p>My Mom was kind enough to clip the whole 2 page spread out of The Star Tribune for me.  Thanks Mom. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8798.webp"  /></p><p>The article was printed on Sunday November 6th, and was written by Star Tribune's art editor, Claude Peck.  You can probably find it on The Star Tribune dot com.  (edit: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/133204103.html" title="http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/133204103.html">Here it is</a>).</p><p>Tonight's event for Chuck Palahniuk wasn't just another stop on the tour, but was part of a series of interviews with high-profile authors of our time.  The Star Tribune and Minnesota Public Radio collaborated on this series entitled <b>Talking Volumes</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Talking Volumes</b></div><p>Talking Volumes is held in downtown St. Paul at the historic Fitzgerald Theater, which is apparently the oldest theater in the Twin Cities (citation needed).  We got there around 5:30pm, and stood outside in line for a little while.  Upon entering the theater, we were given a program was reprinting the entire Star Tribune article in a much more focused format.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8803.webp"  /></p><p>To start off the evening, a woman came up on stage and gave an introduction to the events for the evening.  She give a quick rundown of MPR, and asked for donations (of course).  She brought Claude Peck to the stage, and asked him a few quick questions about the Star Tribune article.  Peck had flown out to Chuck's home in Portland, Oregon several weeks ago to do this "exclusive" interview, and were able to get some nice, current photos of Chuck in the process.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8727.webp"  /></p><p>And with that the woman introduced Kerri Miller.  Miller is the host of Talking Volumes, and a few other programs on MPR.  She's been in broadcasting since 1981, and used to be on KARE-11 news in Minneapolis before joining MPR in 2004.  She started off with a short introduction, and welcomed Chuck to the stage.</p><div class='title'><b>Interview</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8734.webp"  /></p><p>The interview was rather interesting and a little unorthodox.  Miller had a series of prepared questions, but would not disclose them with Chuck.  I'm guessing this is because they didn't want some prepared statement, or marketing answer for each question, but wanted the interview to be an actual interview.  This didn't really go over so well with Chuck.</p><p>For the first few questions, he had to pause for a moment to form the answer in his head.  I don't think that's because he didn't have an answer, but because he wanted to form the answer into something entertaining, funny, or memorable.  After a few answers like this, Miller asks why he felt the need to do this.  Chuck took no time in answering this one.</p><p>It was to put on a show, obviously.  When trying to be funny, or shocking, or memorable, the audience reaction is a clear sign that things are either going right, or wrong.  And having the chance to prepare, gives the opportunity to make the answers pop and excite.  Having to think up entertaining answers on the fly is difficult for anyone. And most of his answers came in the form of a story, or anecdote.  Some stories of which I had heard before.</p><p>She did ask some good questions though, and some of them got down to the fundamental themes brought forth in <b>Damned</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Death and Damned</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8748.webp"  /></p><p>Leading into the Summer of 2008, Chuck had just released <b>Snuff</b>, and was on tour promoting it.  I caught him in Minneapolis that time too!  Check it out = <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">May 27th, 2008</a>.</p><p>He mentioned that Snuff was the first of faux "trilogy" he had written during the previous year while his mother laid in the hospital.  He visited her constantly, and while in her hospital room, he would write.  And what came out of that was Snuff, Pygmy, and Tell-All.  Each of these books were very research focused, and seemed like flushed out short stories.</p><p>In the Fall of 2008, the film based on his novel Choke was released in theaters, and he was up and about again with promoting the film.  Chuck mentioned that he had this very odd juxtaposition of promoting a movie about a Son visiting his dying mother in the hospital, while doing this exact same thing with his own mother in his personal life.  He kept all this somewhat private, at the time.  Shortly after the Choke was release, his mother passed away.</p><p><b>Damned</b> is a trilogy for him strictly dealing with the death of his mother, and the death of his father from 12 years ago.  He mentioned that writing a novel about a 49 year old man, dealing with the death of his parents is way too sad.  So he completely switched the situation to be a young girl dealing with her own death, and missing her parents, her friends, her life.  She's mourning herself, in the same way others would mourn the loss of her.  And she mourns the loss of her parents, because she's dead.</p><p>Damned sounds much more down to earth than his previous couple of novels.</p><div class='title'><b>Being Clever</b></div><p>The night was split up into 3 segments, with each one broken up by a musical break by surf rock band, The Bombay Sweets.  The first two segments were strictly for the interview, and each segment ended with Chuck reading an excerpt from Damned.  For the third segment, Miller opened the floor to questions from  the audience.</p><p>I think Chuck responded to the audience questions with much more enthusiasm than he did with any of the questions by Miller.</p><p>One question was about the scene in the <b>Fight Club</b> film, when Brad Pitt first meets Edward Norton on the airplane.  They have a little conversation, and Norton explains his whole single serving theory of travel.  Brat Pitt replies, "That's clever."  Norton returns, "Thank You."  Pitt continues, "How's that working out for?" Norton , "What?"  Pitt, "Being clever."</p><p>The question was how did he come up with that dialogue, and was there a story behind it.  Chuck professed that it was actually Brad Pitt that came up with that line during filming, and he had nothing to do with it.  But Chuck added to the answer by saying that being witty and clever can really only get you so far.  Witty and Clever are good ways of getting in the door, but you need something more to really hook your audience.</p><p>You need to create something memorable.  Not necessarily something that audience will like, but something that will make an impact. If something impactful happens to you, whether you like it or not, several months or years down the road, it will still be with you.  And at that time, you'll respond to it favorably.  You'll like it then.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8742.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Obedient, The Rebel, The Witness</b></div><p>Another question that was asked had Chuck talking about a very common literary and story telling/writing pattern that emerged in the 20th century.   The idea of the Obedient, the Rebel, and the Witness.</p><p><b>The Obedient</b> is a person who follows the rules perfectly. Society has told them that if you follow these rules, all of your desires will come true. Get good grades in School. Listen to their teachers. Graduate. Go to college. Get a degree. Get a job. Get married. Have kids.  Et cetera.</p><p>Everyone my age was subliminally told this as a child.  And that is how I've followed my life for the most part.  And it's worked out pretty well for me.  It doesn't really work out this way for everyone, though.</p><p>Following this pattern will eventually lead to self-destruction.  In many of these stories, this person is seen as the Martyr.  They do everything in their life "perfectly", but it's not true.  It's not perfect.  And then they fall.  In real life, they fall into the next archetype.</p><p><b>The Rebel</b> is the complete opposite.  They reject everything society has taught them, and follow their own rules.  They feel that society has failed them, or that society has nothing to offer them, or that society is a fraud.  In stories, this person is eventually killed by society.  It's impossible (not really) to live outside of the system, and that system will eventually roll over them, and reject them.</p><p>Most Obedient people will turn rebel when their hopes and dreams are dashed by following the rules.  "The system lied to me."  In our lives, we usually glide back and forth between the two extremes.  We don't like to live in the system, but the system is there for a reason, and it's comfortable.  But FUCK the system.</p><p>The point directly between the Obedient and the Rebel is <b>the Witness</b>.  They are the person who has seen both ends of the spectrum.  They take this knowledge with them.  They are wise because of it, and can guide others through their life.</p><p>Chuck gave some examples of this story telling pattern being used.  Stories such as Gone with the Wind, and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.  In One Flew, Billy Bibbit is the Obedient, McMurphy is the Rebel, and Big Chief is the Witness.</p><p>Chuck mentioned that he incorporated this pattern in <b>Fight Club</b>, but put all these roles in a single character.  The Narrator is the Obedient.  Tyler Durden is the Rebel.  And both of characters types are eventually killed, leaving the Narrator as the Witness.  Marla is possibly the Witness, too.</p><div class='title'><b>End of Interview</b></div><p>At the end of the Interview, Chuck had a little contest to see who could blow up Inflatable pumpkins the fastest and knock them into the sky.  So, the whole theater inflated these things, and started punching them around the place.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8792.webp"  /></p><p>The interview was recorded, and will air on MPR sometime in the next week, I'm guessing.  It was video recorded too, so be sure to check out MPR's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MPRdotOrg" title="http://www.youtube.com/user/MPRdotOrg">Youtube channel</a> for updates on that.</p><p>I came away from the night with a pre-signed copy of Damned, which included several "Postcards from hell" stuffed in the pages, and one of those inflatable pumpkins, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111118_chuck/IMG_8805.webp"  /></p><p>It was a pretty damn spiffy night.  I learned a couple of things, and had a good time.  I brought along my little sister, and her husband to enjoy the night with me, and they had a great time too. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Batman Arkham City Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/batman-arkham-city-thoughts">Batman Arkham City Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 31, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I ran through Arkham City and smashed up the place.  </p><p>It's Okay.</p><p>I guess you could say I was disapointed, but that really comes down to expectations.  I'm definitely a fan of the first game, Arkham Aslyum.  It was surprising, and fantastic, and felt like it came out of no where.  Again...  expectations.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham Asylum</b></div><p>I'm not sure if anyone was expecting something great when they first tried out Arkham Asylum, but I always kept reality in check.  There had never really been a <i>Good</i> game made from a comic book IP.  At least, not a mainstream game.  These type of games are usually just IP fodder.  Some random company is contracted for a Batman game, or a Superman game, or a Spiderman game.  They shit it out, and make money on the name recognition.  Kids buy these games in droves!</p><p>But Arkham Asylum was totally different.  It was a true to form modern Metroidvania style game.  The world you explored was small, tight, and as you progressed through the game, the new abilities and techniques you acquired help you access areas you hadn't previously had access to.  Though, power ups were unlocked through story progression, instead of exploration.  There were many secrets that required some backtracking and using your new gadgets.</p><p>All the gadgets and weapons made sense for the character of Batman, and in the context of exploring and getting to new areas.  It worked perfectly.</p><p>The story was kinda kooky, but made sense given the ridiculous nature of most comic book stories.  It wasn't necessarily trying to be realistic.  </p><p>The villains and their motivations were what brought everything together.  What happens when you get all of your enemies together in one place?  Some form an alliance, some are enemies to each other, some you stay away from, and some just pop when it's the most convenient for them.  Arkham Asylum was incredibly consistent with how the villains would react to each other, and to Batman as he infiltrated the compound.</p><p>There were plenty of interesting set pieces as well.  Like Scarecrow warping Batman's mind, or Joker capturing Batman is recreating the opening credits, but with the roles reversed.</p><p>My expectations were always reserved though, so whenever something amazing happened, I was surprised and delighted.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham City</b></div><p>I think for Arkham City, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and then nothing really did.  It really is just more of the same.</p><p>The story is still okay.  The gadgets are pretty much the same.  Combat is more fluid and fun.  There are 400 Riddler trophies now, instead of 100 in the first game.</p><p>The overworld is about 4 times the size of Arkham Asylum, but it feels really small.  You can only enter just a hand full of buildings.  And when you're in the city, you're usually just gliding from one building to the next.  You aren't really doing anything interesting expect looking for Riddler trophies, or hunting down some random thing for a side quest.  This basically makes Arkham City more like a GTA or Infamous, rather than Arkham Asylum which felt more like Metroid or Zelda.</p><p>There are more villains this time, but it follows the same scheme as the first game.  The heavy hitters are vie for territory in the city, and act appropriately to each other.  Sometimes you are randomly ambushed by those villains who prefer to work alone.  And others form alliances, and blackmail each other.  Not every villain is an actual villain though, which was a nice touch.</p><p>Overall, Arkham City is pretty good and it's fun, but...  it's not really doing anything new.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Beer Label Magnets" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/beer-label-magnets">Beer Label Magnets</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Overall, I found 25 different Oktoberfests.</p><p>This was a slightly dangerous idea though, as it combined 2 of my addictions together: Drinking Beer and Collecting Things.</p><div class='title'><b>Remove Labels</b></div><p>To remove the labels, I used a Wine Label Remover Kit found on Amazon, though, it's a little more expensive than what it is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3">Link</a></p><p>Each wine label remover is basically a thin sheet of laminate.  You wrap the laminate around the bottle, completely covering the label.  Then you peel the laminate off the bottle, taking the label with it.  And cut off all the extra laminate around the label.</p><p>The labels can be subborn sometimes, so I used a box cutter to help it along in most cases.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp"  /></p><p>While it's just as easy (sometimes) to remove the label without the lamanent, i think the labels look much better with the lamanent.</p><div class='title'><b>Attach to Magnets</b></div><p>The last part is affixing them to magnets.  Easy enough.  My little brother recommended using magnets sheets, and Super 77 adhesive spray.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp"  /></p><p>And it worked quite well.

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Phantogram is an American indie band with members Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel.  According to wikipedia, they formed in 2007, but I don't think anyone really heard of them until 2009.  And 2010 is really when they got their "big break", so to speak.</p><div class='title'><b>Eyelid Movies Tour</b></div><p>I was introduced to them last year, right as they started their first national tour for the release of their upcoming debut album, <b>Eyelid Movies</b>.  I saw them on the upcoming board for High Noon Saloon, and my brother, Bill, had mentioned that they were pretty good, and that I'd probably like them.  I listened to some of their songs, and definitely liked them indeed.</p><p>On my birthday last year was when they came into Madison, and my local record store, Strictly Discs, had them put on an intimate in-store performance limited to 50 people.  I got down there the moment they opened up, and made sure to secure my place in line.  Well, it turned out that not a lot of people had heard of this.  Or they weren't interested.  I came back around 3pm when they were actually performing, and was 1 out about 30 people who listened to their short 30 minute set.</p><p>It was pretty fantastic.  They have a very melodic tone that builds a very ambient atmosphere, followed with a drum beat that guides the melodic and chorus of songs.  It's relaxing, but still energetic.  It paints a picture in my mind, every time I hear their songs.</p><p>I recorded the whole performance, last year: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4" title="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4</a></p><p>After they finished, everyone met upstairs for a quick meet-and-greet.  They brought along Vinyl copies of their yet unreleased album.  So I bought one of those, and got it signed by Josh and Sarah.  Unfortunately, I missed their performance at The High Noon later on due to birthday drinking.</p><p>Birthday Drinking wasn't a problem this year, because they came into town one day after. And the concert was on a Monday night, so I wasn't about to get shit-faced on a work night.</p><div class='title'><b>Nightlife Tour</b></div><p>It had been a while since I heard anything about Phantogram.  I saw them on High Noon's upcoming list, and had wondered if they were going to perform anything new since last year.  All of the concerts I had heard leading up to last year, were the same 11 tracks from their album.</p><p>Once again, my brother Bill sent me a link for an upcoming mini-album titled <b>Nightlife</b>.  It had 6 songs, but it still gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard them.  Some songs were rather similar to their earlier stuff.  But others actually iterated on their style, went in a few different directions, but kept their sound in tact.  I really like <b>Turning into Stone</b>, which seems to channel Moby but keeps it in their own voice.</p><p>Last night, they performed at The High Noon Saloon to a sold out crowd.  Sold out! on a Monday night, even.  Phantogram's popularity is exploding right now.  Many critics have very high praise for <b>Nightlife</b>, and even publications such as Wired are even commenting on them.  It's kind of crazy.  I doubt it would be possible to do an intimate in-store performance with them as the place would be overrun.</p><p>Along with greater popularity and a greater crowd, their stage performance has expanded.  They hired a drummer, rather than using a drum looping kit, or whatever.  Using a live drummer really makes their sound POP even more than before.  <b>They are much better live now.</b> Before it just sounded the same.</p><p>They brought along a bunch of lazers and lights too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp"  /></p><p>The crowd at the High Noon was interesting.  There were plenty of girls, hipsters, and kids totally into the indie scene.  They probably follow pitchfork, who have been talking this band up.  Right in the front were a bunch of bros whom I wouldn't think would attend such a show.  In fact, they were the most into Phantogram out of the whole audience.  They were probably drunk, but their hands were in the air the whole time, and they were rockin' out.  They bought me beer, too. :)</p><p>I recorded some video, but I mostly took a bunch of pictures.  I think I took enough notes to identify their set list, too.</p><p>1. ???

| October 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, Five and I went down to Chicago to check out Amon Tobin's tour of his new album ISAM.  His tour included a crazy 3D visualization stage setup designed specifically with his album in mind, and is still currently touring across North America.  From the youtube clips I've seen of the show, it looked pretty neat.</p><p>Here is the trailer for his tour: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI</a></p><p>While the trailer represents what you see on the stage, it has a bunch of audience reactions, which leads me to believe their intended audience is the older, married, family crowd.  These are the types of trailers you'd see for the Blue Man Group, or magicians, or some stupid movie.  The type of trailer that's designed to get those boring people out of their houses and day-to-day lives, and experience something different for a change.</p><p>I'm not sure if they aired that trailer on TV, but the crowd in the Congress Theater was a bit different than the usual EDM crowd I'd expect in Chicago.  Sure, there were plenty of kids who most likely listen to dubstep and electro on the weekends.  As well as the crowd you'd find in clubs on the weekends.  But, there were also those couples who might have seen a commercial, such as the trailer, and figured they could use a night out for a change.  While the normal crowd was pushing and shoving their way around, the married crowd were respectful and nice about how packed the place was.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Opening for Amon Tobin was <b>Emika</b>, who was the official tour opener.  I really don't remember much of her set at all.  We got there about 10 minutes before she finished.  But before Amon Tobin took the stage, they sandwiched in a local opener, <b>Lorn</b>.  Lorn is one half of local electronica group <b>Omega Clash</b>, whose other half is <b>adoptahighway</b>.  I've seen adoptahighway before, and he's pretty slick.  Lorn wasn't too bad either.  He performed a somewhat downtempo, slightly experimental, yet banging set.  It was perfect for keeping the mood solid, while keeping the energy low in anticipation for Amon.</p><p>Lorn finished close to 11pm, and it took a little while for Amon to get everything setup.  I think he finally started around 11:30pm.  The curtains pulled up, and revealed the gigantic geometry stage thingy.  For the most part, it served as a canvas for the visualizations being blasted onto it from the projector right behind Five and I.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp"  /></p><p>The stage presence was huge, and reflected and reacted to the music. Amon Tobin's set was basically playing his new album ISAM from start to finish, with a little improvisation between tracks, but it didn't seem like much.  I hadn't listened to the album ahead of time, but I dunno...  It didn't really speak to me at all.  It was experimental in nature, and didn't really have any groove to it.  Without a constant beat to frame the sounds, it didn't capture my interest.</p><p>After Amon finished ISAM, he exited his contraption, got up a stage, and took a bow.  And went back inside for an encore.  After his encore, he did the same thing, and came back for a second encore.  The style of his first encore was much more drum 'n bass than experimental, and his second encore was kinda in the middle of his two styles.  I'm guessing that his started off as drum 'n bass, and eventually moved into experimental later.</p><div class='title'><b>ISAM v. Shpongletron</b></div><p>Earlier in year, Fishy, Chaos and I saw Shpongle as he rolled in Madison on tour with his own crazy stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  It has wings on the side, and an eye on the top that were made out of LEDs and had several visualizations programmed into them.  In the center sat the Shpongle head.  It would illuminate itself, and the colors would change.  The light source on the head would change as well, which was somewhat trippy to think of how it was doing that.  But then it moved!  The head twisted and contorted.  It would stick its tongue out at you.  It was really interesting to see, mainly because I wasn't expecting that at all.  And there wasn't a projector around either, so I really wasn't sure how that was happening.</p><p>Here's video I took from that show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWf</a> at the 18 minute mark.</p><p>With Amon Tobin's ISAM stage setup, that suspension of disbelief was never there.  The huge projectors in the middle of the floor shone like a spotlight on the stage, and you could clearly see the geometry of the stage setup for what it was.  Plus, there were few times when the visualizations actually took advantage of the cubed nature of the structure.  And even then, you could clearly tell it was being painted on by the projector.</p><p>It really wasn't until Amon's second encore when the visualization reached the level I had experienced with the Shpongletron.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp"  /></p><p>It painted a bunch of stacked cubes on the structure, and they twisted, and collapsed several times.  It was subtle and fit with the design, so it looked believable (at least until they fell over).  The whole rest of the show was way too deliberate.  Some of it would have been better off using a giant LED display instead.</p><p>Overall, it was alright.  Amon Tobin is part of the Ninja Tune record label.  And while I'm a big fan of that label, I think I need to remind myself that their music is very hit-or-miss with me.  Some experimental really grooves and speaks to me, but I think I need to be in a certain mood to receive it properly.  Otherwise, it falls flat :/<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DJ Promos" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dj-promos">DJ Promos</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Back in the day, this was impossible for me.  At $10 a pop, records are not cheap.  Plus, I needed to buy all the equipment, and there was no guarantee I'd be any good at it.  Before DJs went digital, most local DJs either worked at, or spent all their free time in record stores.  They'd be exposed to all the new tracks, and have the equipment available to them on a daily basis.  I didn't have the knowledge, the skills, or the money to invest in doing any of that.</p><p>But in modern times all of that has changed.  All the record stores are online, and you can fit DAYS worth of music in your pocket.  Songs are a mere $1 or $2.  And the only equipment you need to start off with is a laptop with the correct software.  As time goes on, you'll probably pick up equipment to make it easier and more diverse. The best local DJs end up spending all their time on the computer, whether it be on the Internet, or playing around with tracks.</p><p>With that in mind, my friends finally convinced me to give it a go.  I already had collected a bunch of my favorite tracks I've heard over the years, and a whole bunch of new ones.  I downloaded Traktor, and started mixing them together.</p><div class='title'><b>Summertime!</b></div><p>One of my friends throws his annual bonfire party towards the end of summer, and he let me in charge of the music. Leading up to the party, I would collect a bunch of music during the day while listening at work.  When I got home, I'd download them, and mix them all together for the rest of the night.  Things sounded pretty decent.</p><p>I made a promo mix leading up to his party, so people would have an idea of the sound I was bringing.  Or after the party, people could have something to listen to.</p><p>So that's this mix...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 001.mp3</a></p><p>It includes many favorites that I can't get enough of. :)</p><p>1.

Unkle - Heavy Drug (King Unique Smoke Nest Mix)<br/>10. Orbital - Halcyon + On + On (Aaron Static 2011 Bootleg)<br/>11. Rone - So So So</p><p>Though, it is heavy on the Bedrock artists: Guy J, Henry Saiz, Omid 16B, and John Digweed.  Which explains why many of the songs mix together as well as they do.  Orbital - Halcyon + On + On is one of my favorite songs, and Aaron Static's bootleg is an amazing cut of it.</p><p>Overall the party was quite a success.  Gage lent me his mixing board and speakers, so things sounded excellent.  I mixed tracks together for about 8 hours from mid-afternoon into the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>End of Summertime!</b></div><p>After the party, I was busy with a bunch of other things and didn't really get back to mixing more tracks.  I had another DJ mix lined up to record after the party, and I've heard some amazing music since then.  I wanted to make another one before I got the Internet restored in my apartment, and start downloading a whole lot of new tracks.  I wanted to capture some of arrangements I found while mixing stuff together for 8 hours.</p><p>After listening to what I had, a lot of it didn't really fit in a one hour time slot.  There really wasn't a good starting point and ending point to include what I wanted.  So, I basically cut it in half, and built up the first chunk with the following mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 002.mp3</a></p><p>1.

Radiohead - Everything in its Right Place (Oakenfold 2008 Remix)</p><p>I worked backwards piecing together some melodic sounds building up to the somewhat cheesy ending I started off with.  That Pezzner track mixes perfectly with Blazer, and Dan Alcala's Sugarhigh remix is probably the highlight of this set for me.  So smooth :)</p><p>This mix probably would have had a lot more Prog Trance if I had more sources of that type of music.  Trying to keep this mix diverse was hard which is why it turned out so melodic and smooth to start with.  I needed something leading up to Two Months Off, and I didn't want to start off dark.</p><p>But I'm happy with the result :)  I love listening to this kind of music while traveling.</p><div class='title'><b>Falltime</b></div><p>I have a selection of tracks picked out for my next mix, but I haven't arranged them in a cohesive way.  So it's possible I'll end up with something completely different than I intended, much like this last mix.</p><p>Good Times :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ladytron @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ladytron-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">Ladytron @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I listen to a lot of music.  While almost all of this music falls into electronica, and mostly dance and DJ music from there, I try to branch out a bit and find artists that sound different than the rest, or ones that sound totally amazing to me.  This is probably how most DJs cultivate and shape their careers.  At least the ones that actually grow and continue to be relevant, while others drown in the minutia of popular tracks from others.</p><p>I find some pretty amazing music, but end up moving on to the next thing after a while.  As such, I lose track of the artist.  And tend to forget about them, and not really notice if they create anything new, or how their career changes and sound evolves over time.  I never really understand them anymore than a single or few tracks from a particular moment in time.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>But there are a few musicians that I've kept track of over multiple years, and tend to shape my own opinion and taste in music.  One of these bands is <b>Ladytron</b>.  Ladytron has four members, Mira and Helen trade off singing vocals, while Daniel and Reuben are always on synths in the background.   I started listening to these guys towards the end of college in 2005 and 2006.</p><p>They've been around since 1999, and if I heard some of their tracks from the beginning, I probably would have shrugged them off and went on to something else.  In fact, who knows...  I probably did back in the day, and don't remember.  Most of their original songs were kinda emo and seemed to speak to teenage girls.  Their first two albums consisted of several songs dealing with boyfriends and modeling.</p><div class='title'><b>Witching Hour + Velocifero</b></div><p>Around the time I started listening to them, their sound had evolved.  Their third album, Witching Hour (2005), focused much more on the beat and progression of the songs, rather than the lyrics.  The lyrics served as flavor text to captivate the audience, while the beat hooks them in.  "High Rise", "Destroy Everything You Touch", "International Dateline", and "Fight in Built up areas" are all pretty bad ass.  I think <b>High Rise</b> might be my favorite song.</p><p>Velocifero (2008), their fourth album, continued with their more layered rocking atmosphere, but seemed to dial a little bit back, rather than push forward.  Ladytron went on tour in early 2009, which is when I saw them for the first time.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago" title="/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago">Ladytron @ Metro, Chicago // April 4th, 2009</a></p><p>After they finished up the tour, it seemed like they disappeared.  They didn't produce any new music.  They didn't go on tour.  They hardly did anything at all.  Apparently, there was rumor of them breaking up circulating last year.  I think Helen and Mira went off and worked on some new things of their own, while Daniel and Reuben worked on some new songs.</p><div class='title'><b>Gravity the Seducer</b></div><p>And then, early this year, it seemed like a flood of Ladytron news hit the Internet.  They had a brand new single, and an upcoming compilation album focusing on their first ten years, as well as a remix album.  In the middle of the year, they announced their fifth album, Gravity the Seducer, along with a tour promoting the CD!</p><p>While some of the songs on their new CD follow the same vein as Velocifero, Gravity the Seducer has several tracks that are much more ambient than anything they've done before.  It's somewhat odd because the two sounds don't really compliment each other.  <em>White Elephant</em>, <em>Ace of Hz</em>, and <em>Mirage</em> build up the album with their classic sound,  while <em>White Gold</em>, <em>Moon Palace</em>, <em>Altitude Blues</em> etc bring it to a different place.</p><p>I wonder if this inconsistency was born from their unofficial hiatus and rumored breakup.  Maybe Reuben and Daniel were working on this direction when Mira and Helen came back.</p><div class='title'><b>Tour in Minneapolis!</b></div><p>Anyway, last night!, their North American tour came through Minneapolis.  I rented a car, and met up with my little sister to see them live.  The Fine Line Music Cafe is a fantastic venue where I've seen some of my favorite concerts of all time, including Hybrid on <a href="/old/v7/hybrid" title="/hybrid">November 14th, 2003</a> and Moby on <a href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis" title="/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">October 5th, 2009</a>.</p><p>The place slowly filled up with fans, and the crowd was rather diverse and odd.  You had your typical hipster-like youth, and the slightly older alternative crowd.  There were also a couple of punkers there.  And the typical concert going music lovers, like myself.  In addition, there were several older patrons who I would not expect to find at the place.  One of these guys even talked with me at length at how he's such a fan of Ladytron, and how no one he knows has even heard of them before.  I wonder if this is how it'll be for me in 15 years.</p><p>Musician Sonoio was on opening duties, and he warmed up the crowd with his eclectic music.  I'm not really sure how to describe his music.  It was definitely experimental, but felt like it had a tinge of Japanoise thrown on top.  Not like over the top Japanoise, but a more mellow ambient rendition.  I dunno...  His music did not speak to me.  And the crowd swayed back and forth to his performance in anticipation of the main act.</p><p>Sonoio finished up, and started packing away his stuff.  Ladytron roadies took the stand, and performed sound checks.  One of the roadies pasted the set list to the floor...  Well...  Now I know exactly what they're going to play for the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7976.webp"  /></p><p>The set list is as follows:</p><p>1. <b>Soft Power</b> - Witching Hour<br/>2. <b>International Dateline</b> - Witching Hour<br/>3. <b>Mirage</b> - Gravity the Seducer<br/>4. <b>Ghosts</b> - Velocifero (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fTy8_fQJaI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fTy8_fQJaI">video</a>)<br/>5. <b>High Rise</b> - Witching Hour<br/>6. <b>True Mathematics</b> - Light &amp; Magic<br/>7. <b>White Gold</b> - Gravity the Seducer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfsI9qwiBis" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfsI9qwiBis">video</a>)<br/>8. <b>Runaway</b> - Velocifero<br/>9. <b>Ace of Hz</b> - Gravity the Seducer (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5upN1DY6U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5upN1DY6U">video</a>)<br/>10. <b>Little Black Angel</b> - Best of 00-10<br/>11. <b>Discotraxx</b> - 604<br/>12. <b>Fighting in Built up Areas</b> - Witching Hour<br/>13. <b>Seventeen</b> - Light &amp; Magic</p><p>Encore:  (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l4a-gJXY8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3l4a-gJXY8">video</a>)<br/>1. <b>White Elephant</b> - Gravity the Seducer<br/>2. <b>Destroy Everything You Touch</b> - Witching Hour</p><div class='title'><b>Performance</b></div><p>Ladytron were pretty damn awesome.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7992_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>They actually sounded much better than I've ever heard them live before.</p><p>In all of the live recordings on their albums, they always sounded a bit off.  The levels never matched the album versions of their songs.  The drums were either too loud, or not enough.  Some of the synths weren't harmonizing together.  It was a muted experience.  And that was reflected when I saw them in 2009.  It was the exact same sound as their live stuff.</p><p>But that wasn't the case this time.  Not only were all the levels at the perfect balance, and everything harmonized together, it was amplified ten fold and actually engulfed the audience in the atmosphere present from their fantastic songs of Witching Hour.  Also, I was right up from next to the speaker, so that helped too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp"  /></p><p>With the exception of Gravity the Seducer, I've listening to their other songs over and over again, so there weren't many surprises that came out of the night.  The whole audience kept in a constant groove as Ladytron went down their set list.  I kind of wish I hadn't seen that ahead of time.  &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Things did change when they hit "Fighting in Built up Areas."  That song really popped, and threw down a dancey beat.  Everyone was hopping around.  My little sister wasn't too impressed with the evening until they hit this beat.</p><p>Overall, I thought the concert was pretty fantastic.  These songs have never sounded as great as they did in The Fine Line.  Listening to their album version doesn't do the night justice.  I recorded a couple moments from the night, but I think "Fighting in Built up Areas", "High Rise", and "Little Black Angel" were the highlights for me.</p><p>Also!  My little sister and I got a poster of "White Elephants" signed by Mira, Helen, Reuben and Daniel.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp"  /></p><p>Score!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Copper Falls State Park &amp; Highbridge Hills" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/copper-falls-state-park-highbridge-hills">Copper Falls State Park &amp; Highbridge Hills</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

We came across the <b>Highbridge Hills Sports Complex</b> (<a href="http://www.highbridgehillssc.com/pages/CourseMaps/" title="http://www.highbridgehillssc.com/pages/CourseMaps/">link</a>), which offered 7 courses in a single area.  One of which, Blueberry Hill, happens to be the highest rated disc golf course in Wisconsin.</p><p>So, this weekend, we packed up some camping gear, hopped in the car, and traveled high up north to check it out.  We stayed at <b>Copper Falls State Park</b>, which also comes very highly rated.  It's one of the top state parks in Wisconsin, and features tons of hiking, some waterfalls, and interesting wildlife.</p><div class='title'><b>Copper Falls</b></div><p>The first night, we were constantly woken up by these crazy howling sounds, which belonged to several <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fppKGJD3Y6c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fppKGJD3Y6c">Barred Owls</a> yelling at each other over territory, or something.

The "club house" was just a shack at the top of the hill, with two older guys just hanging out talking about disc golf stuff over and over again.  Blueberry Hill was rather unkempt.  Much of the course was overgrown, and started choking out the fair way.  Much of the ground was uneven, and easy to trip on.  And it was usually a game to figure out where the baskets of each holes were.</p><p>For us, many of the holes were incredibly long.  This course would probably test real professionals of the sport, but we're quite amateur.  We play incredibly casually and don't have keep track of the score.  Dave is the only one of us who can actually catch some distance on his drives, and he was still getting 4s and 5s on these (long) par 3s.</p><p>Also, the course was soaking wet from the rain or dew from the previous night, so feet were drenched by the time we finished.  We decided to head up to Ashland, and venture around rather than play anymore.  Then we drank for the rest of the night, and pretty much went home in the morning.</p><p>Camping was totally the highlight of the trip for me. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tiesto @ Aliant Energy Center" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tiesto-aliant-energy-center">Tiesto @ Aliant Energy Center</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 19, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For his "College Invasion" Fall tour, larger than life, trance superstar DJ Tiesto, made Madison, WI one of his stops.  What?  It's kinda odd thinking about Tiesto performing in Madison.</p><p>Though, given how the scene has been exploding around here, and local bookers have been getting some serious talent to come to our town, AND how this is a college tour and Madison is one of top 10 schools in the country, I guess it makes sense.  This is a DJ concert anyway.  He's not playing in some fancy douche bag club.</p><p>Tickets were a mere $37, which is cheap compared to almost any gig in the last 5 years. Also, he took the trouble to come to my town. He's bringing the show to me! I can walk to the damn concert. So, I decided to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Merchandising</b></div><p>To prove just how big a sellout he is, upon entering the lobby of the Alliant Energy Center, I'm greeted with several booths selling and advertising shit.</p><p>There's Tiesto's merchandise booth with a whole lot of overpriced T-Shirts, and other crap.  There's a photo booth!  You can get your picture standing next to a picture background of Tiesto!  Hot Damn!  There was a booth that had the Playstation Move setup showing off some game.  There was a booth with energy drinks.  And another for Axe Body spray.</p><p>I think the bigger offense was during Porter Robinson's opening set.  The huge LED display behind would switch to ads! Which advertised the merchandise booth out in the lobby.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp"  /></p><p>People love rockin' out to T-Shirts!</p><div class='title'><b>Porter Robinson</b></div><p>Opening for Tiesto was Porter Robinson.  I got there around 8:30pm, so I caught the last half hour of his set before Tiesto began at 9pm.  As I entered, he was jammin to a remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4">Deadmau5 - Raise your Weapon</a> that sounded like Madeon's fantastic remix.  It was much longer, and the extended parts didn't sound like it at all, so maybe it was a mashup, or something.</p><p>He set was pretty cookie cutter.  He played songs similar to what I've heard the locals spin around here.  He threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc">Wolfgang Gartner - Illmerica</a> towards the end, which felt like he was going for the popular vote, rather than building his own sound.  (At least, I think it was Illmerica.  It was some well known Wolfgang song.)</p><p>But whatever, I only caught the last half hour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Tiesto</b></div><p>Man, I got there at the perfect time.  I didn't have to stand through any of the openers at all.  30 minutes after I arrived, Tiesto took the stage and started up his set.</p><p>I got the recorded the first 70 minutes of this (plus a few other clips), so take a look for yourself.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627</a></p><p>He starts off which a self indulging intro.  It's probably the club life theme song.  After he throws in a sample of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk">Imogen Heap - Hide &amp; Seek</a> (I thought it was BT at first), and starts hopping from trance anthem to trance anthem, and eventually goes into more Big Room (or whatever) House.  He pretty much kept with the Housey trend throughout the rest of the set, though some songs still kept a trancey vibe.  It's the kind of sound that he's known for these days.</p><p>He DID throw in a few classic tracks, which was a pleasant surprise.  One of which was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw">Delerium - Silence (Tiesto Remix)</a>.  Only it WASN'T the Tiesto Remix!  Arrgghh.  It was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4">W&amp;W + Jonas Stenberg Remix.</a> This song is evil.  It uses the exact same build up as the Tiesto mix, but then shits all over itself with a breaky climax, rather than the beautiful atmospheric sound of the original.  Fuck this song.</p><p>I caught a few other songs too, but I don't remember their names.  (I did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgAwGHREhf0">record</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGZBShiUMQ">them</a>, though.)   He ended with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujB7A5ycew" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujB7A5ycew">Tiesto v. Diplo - C'Mon</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7390_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7397_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Sound</b></div><p>The two panoramics above illustrate the kind of place this concert was held at.  This is the exhibition hall in the Alliant Energy Center.  A huge room surrounded by concrete and steel.  And, as Zack reminds me, the same place were they have horse shows, and monster truck rallies.  It's the same basic layout as an airline hanger.</p><p>The accoustics are horrible.  The bass bounces off all the walls, and makes a thunderous sound that echos through the entire space.  It drowns out any actual noise from the bass itself.  It turns into this Boom-Boom-Boom.  So, every bass line is identical throughout the set.  You can hear this quite plainly in the video I took.</p><p>The rest of the levels were jacked up, so you COULD make out what the songs actually were.  But even that had echo in this huge concrete hall.  Certainly not as much echo as the bass, but it still blurred the songs a tad.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>A Good Time</b></div><p>While, I'm pretty down on Tiesto, and he is a total sellout and a bit of a hack, I had a great time.  But, with my expectations so damn low to begin with, there's no place to go but up!</p><p>The crowd was quite amazing, too.  I think that was the biggest surprise for me.  There were some college kids there, but they were mostly in the huge bit in front of the stage.  Hanging back in the comfortable section were the actual fans.  Tiesto fans maybe, but definitely Trance fans.  Clubbers from Chicago and Milwaukee, and a bunch of kids that just wanted to dance and have fun.  There weren't any huge assholes.</p><p>When Tiesto hit on his mark with the Trance hits, everyone in the crowd was dancing and cheering.  Everyone was totally in the moment with this concert.  People were actually paying attention!  Rather than typing on their phone, or yelling at each other, or trying to feel each other up.</p><p>I haven't seen a crowd this responsive in a while.  But maybe this could be because it was on a weekday rather than a weekend, and people weren't drinking the night away.  And most trance fans are older than the new crop of EDM fans who are into dubstep, electro house, and all that stuff.</p><p>I had fun :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music-2">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
