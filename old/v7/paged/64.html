| August 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings everyone from Seattle, one of the greatest places in the United States.  The air is rather pure, with a slight accent of pine, the streets are rather clean for a rather large metropolis, and there are farely few bums to be found.</p><p>I'm in Seattle because of the nation's large gaming get together, the <b>Penny Arcade Expo</b> or PAX.  The year is year number 4, which has been relocated to the Washington Community Center where I had attended Sakura-con back in April.</p><p>Last night, I got into the area around Midnight or so, met up with Dan & Becky, and pretty much went straight to bed since Midnight = 2AM local time, for me.  This morning I woke up at 7AM, which is pretty amazing.  Rarely am I awake and ready to hit the town so early, until I realized, it was actualy 9AM local time, for me.</p><p>We got over to PAX about 8.30-ish where the line had already begun to form, despite PAX not opening until 2pm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" /></p><p>The line was kinda long, but was it really worth it to sit in line for close to 5 hours, just to get inside right as it opened? I mean, the Con itself will be pretty widely opened later.  Yeah, screw this line crap.  let's tour!</p><p>We went down the road to Pike's Peer or Pike's Place or whatever you wish to call it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" /></p><p>Pike's Peer is a cornucopia of local farmers, fisherman, floral-men, gift shops, etc. all along the waterfront of the Seattle bay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" /></p><p>Absolutely beautiful..  How can you not love Seattle.  Honestly..</p><p>Also on Pike's Peer is the Starbucks Number 1.  The first Starbucks ever made.  The originator.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" /></p><p>Out front were a bunch of hippy musicians.</p><p>This stand has a bunch of chiles on a string!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" /></p><p>Inside Pike's Peer was an aptly named sushi bar, Umai Sushi & Teriyaki.  Umai is kind of a trendy word for delicious or super delicious in Japan.  Kinda like "Yum" or "Yummy" in our vocabulary.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" /></p><p>After Pike's Peer we walked past the Art Museum, and visited the Seattle Public Library, which is a marvel of modern-esq architecture..  Difficult to photograph in tight quarters though :/</p><p>It was starting to get close to 2pm, so we decided to head back to PAX and sit in line once again.  We took a shortcut through the park</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" /></p><p>Back at the Con, the line had grown just a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" /></p><p>But it really wasn't too long before began to move, and we were past the gates and inside the exhibition hall.</p><p>more pictures!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" /></p><p>4pm rolled around very quickly, which was when the guest of honor, Wil Wheaton, was to give his keynote speach.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" /></p><p>Wil Wheaton gave an amazing speech of his childhood growing up with games, what games really meant to him, and how gaming is really the social pinacle of our lives as gamers.  The fact that gaming a social medium on the same level as any other hobby, and it is also an artist medium on the same level as movies and fine art.</p><p>He also blasted any political critics that defined gaming as anti-social, because in our own lives, gaming is nothing but a social activity.  How else would 30,000 gamers come together at one location to be with each other, simply because we ARE gamers.  This is no difficult than a bunch of sports fan packing into a stadium to watch a game.  Nothing different than state citizens coming together for a state fair.</p><p>As he said to finish off his speech..  if you find someone who thinks that gaming is anti-social.  you should invite him over sometime to play a game, and see what they think of it. ^_^</p><p>Great speech overall..  Hopefully the PAX07 dvd will be released containing it.  If not, hopefully the video will pop up on YouTube at some point.  It's probably there now..  maybe.</p><p>After Wil Wheaton's speech, Gabe and Tycho take the stage for some hilarious Q & A.  One Q resulted in Tycho singing on stage, which resulted in everyone holding their lighters in the air, or in the case of us gamers..  our DS screens.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" /></p><p>As a special ironic treat, Gabe & Tycho has a special guest star for an improtu appearance after their Q&A.  Someone reveared in the gaming community.  To their dismay, they were unable to get Jack Thompson to attend, but got the next best guest..  Uwe Boll.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" /></p><p>haha.  It was rather hilarious that they actually got him to come to PAX and speak to the crowd..  but it didn't really pay off all that much.  This guy is pretty damn boring, and just ended up talking about random things that weren't interesting.  Joystiq taped a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/25/pax-07-uwe-bolls-guest-appearance-on-video/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/25/pax-07-uwe-bolls-guest-appearance-on-video/">video of Uwe Boll on stage</a>.</p><p>Outside, I ran into Mr. Destructoid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" /></p><p>And we continued looking around the exhibition hall.</p><p>They had an aquarium cooled PC box.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" /></p><p>It was around this time that we caught up with Ace & Jess, who were working at the Con, later in the night.  We went a couple blocks away to an amazing Asia-esq restaurant, Wild Ginger.  A very trendy semi-upscale restaurant where the food was fantastic.  I had the Mushrooms and Peapods.</p><p>Back at the Con, we were getting pretty tired but hung around a little while for the One-Ups, which were the first headliners at this evenings concert.  The was starting to wear on us though, so we began to make our way back to the room for the evening.<br/>___</p><p>I must say that PAX is quite impressive.  Not only have a had a great time seeing a ton of new games, met Mr. Destructoid, listened to Wil Wheaton talk passionately about gaming, and so forth.. but the Con itself is amazing organized.  For already having 30,000 registered people at this Con, everything is spread out enough that you're hardly cramped for space.</p><p>Even all the standing in lines hasn't been that bad at all because everyone had been sifted off into areas that could accommodate everyone.</p><p>There's so little frustration with the way everything in being handled that all you see is everyone having a great time.  No one is pissed off, or bitchy.  When you look at random people, they have smiles across their faces.</p><p>So far, I'm having a great time here, and it's really amazing to have that Con spirit rekindled inside of myself after getting so damn bored at Anime Conventions.  These resurfaced feelings of being at Con remind of the first time I went to Anime Iowa back in 2002 or 2001.</p><p>Fantastic.<br/>___</p><p>Anywho.. more to follow on tomorrow's events. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Recent Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/recent-movies">Recent Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This summer has been pretty kickass for movies.  In fact, I don't think there's been a summer where I've gone out and seen so many movies.  Transformers, The Simpsons, Superpad, Bourne Ultimatum, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Spiderman 3, Live Free or Die Hard..  All of them entertaining, and some pretty good.</p><p>There are two other movies I've seen this summer which are also pretty good, but not as widely talked about as these big Blockbusters..</p><p><b>The Invasion</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>This past weekend, when I was back home in Minneapolis my little brother and I caught The Invasion, starring Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  The Invasion is about an alien invasion on earth based off of the novel Body Snatchers, and somewhat of a remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Nicole Kidman is a now divorced single mom who is loosely dating Daniel Craig, when the invasion begins.  They try to survive, all while solving the key to defeating the aliens.</p><p>The Invasion is the most passive alien invasion I have ever witnessed in film.  These aliens are micro-organisms which infect humans by mutating nerve cells.  Once the individual falls asleep, the organisms take advantage of our involuntary glandular sweating to transform us from who we were, into their completely controlled slaves.  We're still who we are.. we're just controlled by them.</p><p>The first hour of the movie is their subtle take-over of humanity.  Once the main characters figure out what's going on, it's too late and it becomes a race for survival.  Nicole Kidman's son is immune to their advances and Nicole Kidman must retrieve him and bring him to the resistance to develop a cure.  But, she's been infected and must keep herself from falling asleep and turning into a slave.</p><p>The Invasion is very intense.  It's a lot like a zombie movie..  the fear of being discovered while hiding from the zombies.  the intense action of running away from zombies.  The Invasion ends strong, but begins very weak.  It's not the best movie in the world, but for some reason..  it really sticks with me.  Probably because i really like Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  Plus, some the zombie/aliens are quite creepy and spooky.. like that little Asian kid.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion:</em></b> Anywho, catch it out, if you're so inclined.  It's not half bad..</p><p><b>Stardust</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>Stardust is a fantasy fairy-tale written by Neil Gaiman.  I saw this about a week ago down in Rockford with Erika and Stephen.</p><p>Stardust's main hero is a boy named Tristan and his story of becoming a man.  He lives in a little english town called Wall, which is bordered by a wall that humans must never pass through.  Beyond the wall lies the fairy-tale kingdom of Stormhold, where, this very day, the King lie on his death bed.  Stormhold has a tradition that only a solitary living heir may ascend the throne..  which is a problem since 4 sons still live.  As the king, played by Peter O'Toole, draws his finally breath..  the one to ascend the throne will turn his now diamond pendent back into a Ruby.</p><p>Ok, I'm going to stop right here and not give away the entire movie.  Suffice to say, a star falls to earth which Tristan wishes to capture for his "true love".  But the witch wished to possess this star for immortality.  The ruby knocked the star out of the sky, so the Star has the Pendant on her.  Everyone is after the Star, which Tristan finds first.</p><p>This movie is quite a gem.  It features several all-star actors, Peter O'Toole, Michele Pfeiffer, Claire Daines, Robert De Niro, and Ian McKellen..</p><p>Stardust reminds me a lot of Princess Bride.  It's completely ridiculous and never takes itself seriously, but still retains a serious plot and presents a wonderful tale of love and adventure.  There were times I smacked myself on the head because it was so dumb, but also warmed my heart at the cutesy scenes.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think it'll reach the cult star power that Princess Bride has these days, but it might if the proper crowd gets a hold of it.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion: </em></b> Definitely check it out. ^_^  Great date movie.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 21, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dexter is a television program on Showtime.  Dexter, played by Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under fame, is a serial killer.  His victims happen to be other serial killer and murderers.  This is the way he balances out his serial killer need for bloodshed while performing acts of good.  A vigilante at night, but a forensics officer during the day, solving crimes and misdeeds of bloodshed and foreplay.  One job helps facilitate the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 1</b></div><p>However, Dexter's word is turned upside down with the emergence of a true rival.  A serial killer with true value of cleanliness, precision, and love towards his killing methods.  This killer leaves hints for Dexter.  Plays with Dexter.  Looks for a friend in Dexter.  and Dexter finds a playmate in him.</p><p>Dexter is a wonderfully crafted, suspenseful show that will leave you wanting more and more.  I was first recommended to watch this show when I returned from Japan and visited Platteville for the first time.  Matt, Dave, Jamie and Tony were all in agreement that I needed to see this..  but I was busy dealing with the depression of being back in the states.  Luckily, when I visited Justin in North Carolina he was of the same opinion, sat me down with Showtime on Demand, and let me be.</p><p>Season 1 just came out today on DVD, and I definitely recommend this show to those who haven't seen it.  Unlike those arrogantly priced HBO series, Showtime has priced Dexter Season 1 at $40 MSRP..  but you can pick it up all 12 episodes of season 1 for $30 at Best Buy this week.</p><div class='title'><b>Showtime v. HBO</b></div><p>Showtime is really pushing the public towards this show, it seems.  Now that HBO is basically dead, and half a million subscribers canceled their service because Sopranos is now done, Showtime sees this as its chance to pull in as many of that audience as possible.  Dexter is a strong strong show.</p><p>Hell, we almost switched over to Showtime from HBO because of the Sopranos and Dexter, but ended up just quitting HBO.  Sorry, but John from Cincinnati is ass.</p><p>These real high profile pay-channel TV programs really start off strong, for the most part.  Sopranos Season 1 and 2 were amazing, but then began to wither in Season 3.  Six Feet Under Seasons 1 and 2 were equally amazing, but again.. lost all steam in Season 3.  Deadwood didn't keep it's amazing quality past Season 1.  Season 2 killed it.  And Now John from Cincinnati can't even start up strong.</p><p>Season 1 of Dexter was quit well done, despite a couple stereotypical drama-like plot devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 2</b></div><p>Episodes 1 and 2 of Dexter Season 2 have been "leaked" on the Internet.  I just finished watching them and this show really raised the bar.  I can't wait for episode 3...  which'll be in the second week of October :/</p><p>I use the term "leaked" loosely because if I were Showtime, I would send out the first episode or two to generate even more buzz on the show.  I mean, I want to see Season 2 now more than ever thanks to that 2 hour teaser.  It makes decent sense.</p><p>The first two episodes work very well with each other and tie up most of the stuff brought up in this episodes.</p><div class='title'><b>Anywho..</b></div><p>Definitely great stuff..  But, Rent or Netflix Dexter Season 1 today.  ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Planet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-planet">Lost Planet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lost Planet is one of those super-hyped games on the 360 last Christmas season.  Superb Graphics, Superb Gameplay, Superb so forth..  Right before It came out, all the retails had in store demos, and when I played the game, I thought it was just god awful.  The controls felt so slow and inaccurate that I couldn't get any joy out of it.</p><p>Well, the other day, I read an article on 1up from creator Keiji Inafune, who is also the creator of Megaman and Dead Rising.  When creating the game engine for Dead Rising and Lost Planet, he assembled all of his friends from his glory days in early Capcom history.  All his pals that spent those lonely nights developing Megaman 2 with him were all back developing these 360 titles.</p><p>Being of like mind, they designed both Dead Rising and Lost Planet with Megaman in mind.  After they finished the game engine, the lead developer came to Inafune and said, "my work is done.  we can now bring Megaman to the next generation."</p><p>After hearing this, I was astounded.  This was the main impetus behind developing Lost Planet?  To further refine their next-gen Megaman engine?  Maybe I misjudged this game.</p><p>So.. I set forth to find a copy of Lost Planet and give it a fair shake.  Perhaps I overlooked the love behind the money.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Planet</b></div><p>Lost Planet is about a new planet found by humans to further their exploration in space.  It is a desolate frigid iceberg.  One day while attempting to further their understanding of the planet, Aliens known as the Akrid attack the humans.  "Holy crap!  There's aliens in dem hills"  Humanity gets their ass kicked, but develops mechas known as VS to battle the Akrid.</p><p>Thus, the war between humans and aliens begins.</p><p>You are Wayne.  One of these common workers on the planet, to further mining and expanding the human society on the planet, when a gigantic Akrid attacks and kills off your father.. figure.  When you run away, you're lost in a snow storm in pass out.  Then a girl with huge breasts and a tight outfit despite subzero temperatures finds you, along with this dork and a mysterious scientist.  And you go around and do some missions for them all while finding your purpose in life.</p><p>Typical animu bullshit.  The story is absolutely ridiculous and the plot doesn't make any sense.  For the longest time, you're fighting this organization that wants to terraform the planet, but you keep trying to stop them.  Isn't that the damn point of being on this planet in the first place?!  You want humanity to be able to inhabit this planet.  Why is your goal to prevent this?!</p><p>Eventually you find out that terraforming the planet will kill everything on it.  Well, let's do it.  Light the shit up.  ugh..</p><p>Anyways..  the story really isn't the reason I got the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Gameplay</b></div><p>What's really ironic about this whole experience is the gameplay.  I'm playing this game for the gameplay.  And that is also the most annoying thing about the game.  The annoying story is really only fueled by how annoying the gameplay is, otherwise the story would just be hilariously bad.  Something to jest about.</p><p>Just like my original expression of the gameplay, it is slow, unresponsive and an overall pain in the ass if you want to pull off any sort of precision.  Nearly all bosses require you to fight in a VS, which are incredibly slow.  Jumping takes an extra second to get lift off the ground.  There's no quick movement to dodge away from attacks.  You really have to know the boss strategy and have patience in order to effectively win the game, which doesn't translate in multiplayer at all.</p><p>Pain in the ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>What's worse about this game is the single player is the only thing you can do these days.  No one is playing multiplayer because there's better things out there these days.  Everyone is playing Rainbow 6 Vegas or GRAW.</p><p>360 games are such fads.  The media hypes the shit out of them, and everyone is playing when it first comes out.  But 6 months later, the online rooms are vacant.  360 gamers have moved on to their next overly hyped game and playing that multiplayer.</p><p>Of course, the failure of multiplayer for Lost Planet is partly due to the horrible gameplay.  How are you supposed to get all the multiplayer achievement points when you can't play multiplayer?  Gamers are off playing their new game for achievements, and left this game behind.</p><p>People seem to think that the Wii is a fad, but jesus..  How are 360 fps games not a fad?  Gamers move from one game to the next and retailers only retain the cash difference between the New price and the trade-in price.</p><p>This over-saturation is ridiculous.  Their are too many games out, and too many games coming out to justify paying $60 per game.  Honestly, this only decreases the quality of games and makes them "snack-size" rather than something you can really sink your teeth into.  Even Resident Evil 4 I could really sink my teeth into, but it wasn't enough.  It was a 10 hour game.</p><div class='title'><b>Crap</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost Planet is crap.  I'm through kidding myself that this game is something special.  Unfortunately, Inafune, your gameplay is just too annoying.  I wanted to like this game, but playing it just pisses me off.  You can't even beat the final boss, goddammit.</p><p>Don't buy this game and rent other games instead.  The Single player really isn't worth your time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock for Sale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale">Schlock for Sale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These foods boost muscles, fight cancer, enhance eyesight, stimulate the brain and also boost your immunities.

You know it's healthy when it looks completely inedible.  Contrary to the look, it tastes amazing.  Very fruity, but what a little subtle hint of vegetable.  Just what the body needs to lay around all day typing away at the computer, and watching TV.</p><p>One other thing that article had that I absolutely love is Black Bean salsa.  Mix some of that with white rice, and put it in a tortilla along with some more Spinach, and you're ready to open your very own Q'doba restaurant chain.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 360 Demos / Metroid preview update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/360-demos-metroid-preview-update">360 Demos / Metroid preview update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The past couple of days have given us some spiffy demos of high profile upcoming Xbox 360 Games.  Such games include Stranglehold, Bioshock, and Beautiful Katamari.</p><p><b>Stranglehold</b> is directed by John Woo and stars Chow Young Fat as hot headed cop, Tequila, on a one man mission to take down the Chinese mafia plaguing the streets of Chicago.  Stranglehold prides itself on being the best stereotypical action-packed cop B movie game there is.  The Demo is pretty much the first level, and you fly through it shooting up Chinese mafia guys.</p><p>After playing through the demo again, I've starting noticing the little things that really make this game shine.  As said above, it prides itself on being stupid and cliche.  As such, you can do numerous amounts of cheesy action moves to kill your foes, which is facilitated by slow-motion gunfire known as Tequila Time.  Whenever you're doing a cheesy action move, and have some Tequilla Time remaining, time will slow down, and you can pull off your shots.  There's also things in the environment to aid you.  You can shoot down Neon signs into enemies, or ignite exploded barrels near enemies.</p><p>The Demo can be pretty fun, but it all gets old pretty quick once you've unlocked all the Tequila Time moves.  Deep down, the game is pretty stupid, and is saved by the fact of how laughable it is.  I don't know why anyone in their right mind would pay full price for this game, let alone, the special collector's editions.  dull.</p><p>Next up, I played the <b>Bioshock</b> demo.  Bioshock is one of the three most anticipating 360 exclusive titles this fall, along with Halo 3 and Mass Effect.  It's also the spiritual sequel to System Shock 1 and 2 for the PC.  Bioshock prides itself on its immersive gameplay and countless game altering decisions made by the gamer, although you see none of this in the Demo.</p><p>The world of Bioshock takes place in Rapture, a Utopian type society underwater away from the world of 1960.  You are Jack, who happens upon this world when your plane crashes into the ocean.  (haha.. lost ripoff).  The world is very stylized in a 1960s feel, too.  Something in the world of Rapture has gone wrong, and find yourself stuck in the middle of a war between the Utopians and the citizens.  When you get in the world of rapture, the first you need to do is defend yourself, so grab that crobar..  i mean, wrench and start bashing away at aliens..  i mean, crazy people.  The intro is very derivative of half-life.</p><p>The similarities between Half-life and Bioshock end there, though, and you move through the falling apart city, searching for a way out, guiding by the guy on the other end of your walkie talkie.  From what people have been saying about the game, the Demo must not give the game much credit at all.  The Demo was actually pretty boring, aside from the 60s style architecture, music, videos..  pretty much 60s everything.  I think renting it would give you a better impression.</p><p>Lastly, i played the <b>Beautiful Katamari</b> demo, which followed the same lines of mediocrity.  Beautiful Katamari offers nothing that isn't present in the previous two or three games.  You roll around, pick up stuff, and beat the level.  The graphics are tighter, but the controls feel a little weird compared to the Playstation... nothing you can't get used to though.</p><p>All in all, these demos are up on the marketplace, so you should check 'em out for yourself.  I'd say that Stranglehold gives you the best impression of what the full game will actually be like.<br/>____</p><p>On the Nintendo side of things, the Metroid preview was updated yesterday, and eluded to some very interesting story elements.  The preview indicated the emergence of the Aurora project, which fused organic brain material into super computers.  These super computers could be of either gender..</p><p>Mother Brain?..  hello</p><p>Their whole month of Metroid marketing plan is beginning to make even more sense now.  Rereleasing the previous Metroid games which actually dealt with Mother Brain as the main villain.  It also gives the impression that these 3 Metroid games are imperative to the overall story of Metroid, and the others were more like side missions.  Not to say that, Metroid 2 wasn't important, but just important enough that Super Metroid can tell you about it.</p><p>It's rather interesting that the Metroid series forms another parallel to the Zelda series by doing this.  I mean, Metroid NES is nothing more than a side-scroller space-themed Legend of Zelda, in the first place.  But the most recent Legend of Zelda gave the impression of what games were actually important in the series, and which ones were merely side stories.</p><p>Twilight Princess basically told me that there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess.  Will Metroid Prime 3 basically tell me that there are 3 main Metroid games?  Metroid, Super Metroid, and Metroid Prime 3?  I'd like to think they pull Metroid Prime 1 into that list though..</p><p>Anywho, check out the new videos on the Wii.  2 more videos are coming on Thursday. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Fall Season" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-fall-season">The Fall Season</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's nice outside and the general media actual promotes the activity of going outside by not airing anything good on TV (except for the Sopranos finale).  I've had a great time, actually..  Disc golfing, relaxing, spelunking.  But as the summer begins its downward spiral post-climax, it's also great to look forward to TV again.  and why not?  TV is actually starting to get good again, in general.  When does everything begin?  Let's see here...</p><p>Monday, <b>September 24th</b> - NBC - <b>Heroes</b> Season 2 Premiere<br/>Thursday, <b>September 27th</b> - NBC - <b>The Office</b> Season 4 Premiere<br/>Sunday, <b>September 30th</b> - SHO - <b>Dexter</b> Season 2 Permiere<br/>Thursday, <b>October 4th</b> - NBC - <b>30 Rock</b> Season 2 Premiere</p><p>All four of these shows have their previous season DVD box set releasing in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>August 21st - Dexter Season 1<br/>August 28th - Heroes Season 1<br/>September 4th - The Office Season 3<br/>September 4th - 30 Rock Season 1</p><p>The Dexter box-set is crazy cheap on Amazon, so i pre-ordered that one, but I think i'll pass on the other box sets. Unfortunately, both <b>LOST</b> and <b>Sarah Connor Chronicles</b> begin airing in Feb 2008, so the waits continues :/</p><p>__</p><p>In other completely un-related news, I cut my hair a little bit on Thursday.  I sliced off a whole 3 or 4 inches on my general length.  I must say, it feels quite nice.  You'd think shortening my hair a mere 8 or 10% wouldn't make much of a difference, but it feels more manageable.  That's probably more a result of having even ends, though.</p><p>It feels good.  I should have trimmed my hair a while ago.  The last time sheers had touched my auburn locks was well over 4 years ago..  maybe closer to 5, actually.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wii Upgrades" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wii-upgrades">Wii Upgrades</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Wednesday, Nintendo released a firmware upgrade for the Wii which featured a couple of spiffy things.</p><p>1) Wii Store revamp<br/>2) Clock on dashboard<br/>3) Reorder friends in your Address book (thank god)</p><p>but two other things came shuffled underneath the rug that were not documented by Nintendo.</p><p>The Good) Hey, now you can use a USB keyboard when writing messages and a couple other programs.  You can't use it on the Wii Browser, but give 'em a few months.</p><p>The Bad) All Freeloaders are now rendered useless on the Wii.  The freeloader was a legit swap disc used to play any region's Gamecube games.  Very handy for importers.</p><p>I'm not too pissed off about the freeloader.  Nintendo Puzzle Collection is the only worthwhile import.  I suppose someday I'd like to play Giftpia or Doshi the Giant, but those days can wait.<br/>___</p><p>This morning, Nintendo released another little update available for Free in the Shop Channel.  It's Metriod Prime 3 preview featuring two movies and some other stuff.  You can watch the full trailer for the game, and also another video highlighting gameplay?</p><p>It's about time Nintendo got around to doing something comparable to Xbox and Playstation.  The more game videos the better, but it should REALLY include a demo of the game.  Hopefully, they'll do this with Mario Galaxy, Smash Brothers, and Mario Kart, in some way.</p><p>With this preview, Nintendo has dubbed August as the Month of Metroid.  The next 3 Mondays will feature a Metroid release.  August 13th, the original Metroid will be available on Virtual Console.  boring.  August 20th, Super Metroid will be on VC.  I think this is the first time Super Metroid has been re-released.  I will definitely pick that up when I get home from work.</p><p>And August 27th, Metroid Prime 3 will be finally be available.<br/>___</p><p>Fun times on the Wii.  Nintendo is starting to show that they are heading in the right direction, but the Virtual Console, and the Wii in general, NEEDS to have demos in some way.  Sure, I wouldn't have bought Big Brain if i played a demo, but I might pick up another game I'm not expecting.</p><p>The same goes for the DS.  Have a DS Download channel you can download DS demos on.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/65">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/63">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
