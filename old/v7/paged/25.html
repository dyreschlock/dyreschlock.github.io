| March 9, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Currently, I am an ALT teaching English in Takayama, Gifu, Japan.  I teach at both junior high and elementary levels.  My role in junior high is more of an assistant to the full-fledged English teachers at school.  But my role in elementary schools is much more autonomous.  I teach English with the home room teacher, HRT, and the HRTs are usually not English teachers.  They tend to leave all the planning, preparation, and execution of the class to me, the ALT.</p><p>For planning and preparation, and for every class I've ever done, I've written a lesson plan.  A lesson plan is exactly what it sounds like.  It's a (somewhat) detailed account of everything I plan to do for the lesson, including how long things might take, and what materials are required.  It's essentially a recipe.</p><p>In the next year, I plan on changing how I write my lesson plans, and how I conduct class.  This post is the story of my past, present, and future of writing lesson plans.  It's where I've been, where I am, and where I intend to do in the next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I've been</b></div><p>This is where I've been.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is a collection of every lesson plan, and worksheet I've written over the last two years.  Both fifth and sixth grade have one hour of English of each week.  There are 43 weeks in a school year, but only 35 are required for English.  I teach the other lower grades about once a month.</p><p>Here are two example lesson plans.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-self-intro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-self-intro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-self-intro.webp" /></a></div></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-lesson-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-lesson-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-lesson-1.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These are my first two classes for fifth grade 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> for the 2014 school year.  The first class is my self-introduction.  The second class begins the material from Hi Friends 1, the official text book for the course.</p><div class='title'><b>Flow</b></div><p>Almost all of my lesson plans follow the common "Engage -> Study -> Activate" pattern.  I learned this from that online TEFL course I attended two years ago.  The <b>engage</b> phase essentially warms up the students.  It gets them thinking about the subject and recalling knowledge they already know.  The <b>study</b> phase introduces new content to the students.  The <b>activate</b> phase gives the students a chance to use this knowledge for themselves.</p><p>My self-introduction lesson doesn't follow this pattern exactly, but my plan for Lesson 1 does.  For all my lesson plans, my review section is the engage phase.  "Today's Aim" is the study phase.  And "Activity" is the activate phase.</p><p>The review phase is essentially a tool box.  I'm making a list of everything a student needs to continue the lesson, and putting those contents on the black board.  Even if a student was absent, or totally forgot the previous class, everything they need to know to continue is presented to them at the top of class, and put into view.</p><p>Then, continuing the lesson, I add something new.  A new tool for the tool box, if we continue this analogy.  I give them the tool, explain it to them, teach them how to use it, and then we practice.</p><p>At the end of every lesson is the activity.  The activity makes use of the new tool, and uses the other tools as well.  This gives students a chance to use what they've learned for themselves, and understand it better.</p><p>In class, I'm very upfront about what we plan on doing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the top of class, I place cards on the black board detailing the outline of my lesson plan.  Sometimes I go into detail upfront, but only if it's something irregular, or new.</p><div class='title'><b>Collaboration</b></div><p>Prior to every class, I meet with the home room teacher, give them a copy of the lesson plan, and discuss the contents.  And I usually do this several days in advance.  I rotate around to 3 separate elementary schools, and before I leave one elementary school for a day, I will meet with all the teachers for classes I have on my next visit.  So when I'm done for the day, everything is set up for the next time I'm there.</p><p>During our meeting, I will make it clear if there's anything I need the home room teacher to do, or prepare in advance in order to make class go as smooth as possible.  Also, we can iron out any problems that might occur with my plan, or address any problems specific students might have in class.</p><p>Explaining everything is great for both of us.  I can hear myself talk and essentially practice explaining things the way I will in class.  Hell, if I can't explain my games to the students, there's no way the students will understand.  And if the students don't quite understand me, the teacher knows what is going on, and can make things clear for the students.</p><div class='title'><b>Ideas</b></div><p>I should quickly mention where I actually come up with my ideas for lessons.  The crux of every ALT is coming up with appropriate and effective games and activities for students to use what they've learned.  ALTs use a variety of resources to come up with these ideas.</p><p>I rarely actually come up with a completely new original idea that really works in class.  Sometimes it happens, but more often it's a variation of something else.</p><p>All of my best ideas have come from other ALTs and teachers.  Other ideas have come from the recommended lesson plans, the Gifu published lesson plans, predecessor's lesson plans, Englipedia, and that Team Teaching Pizza book.  I actually use the text book on occasion, too.</p><p>All the ideas that I use (or steal) are ones that I can visualize myself doing in class.  If there's something amazing game out there, but I can't actually see how it fits into my teaching style or plans, then I'm not going to use it.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning Ahead</b></div><p>After writing my first few plans, it became VERY clear that I needed to plan further ahead than just the next week.  I needed to organize all the goals for a lesson, and put them in a clear and logical order that makes sense.  Otherwise, I was forgetting some parts of the lesson, or introducing them too late, or not fully understanding the point of the lesson.</p><p>I started writing a syllabus for the whole lesson and quickly wrote down the review, aim, and activities for each class.  I should've added one here as an example, but it was basically just a straightforward, topdown list.  This really helped me visualized the end, which helped make the journey more successful, and content rich.</p><p>I began giving these to my teachers whenever we began a new lesson in the book so they could see the end, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Evaluation and Keeping a Journal</b></div><p>After every lesson, and every day at school, I record the results of my lesson plans in my schedule book.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I write about the good and the bad.  I write about events that happen at school, and whether or not the students were more annoying than usual.  I also write about events that happen on the weekend, like results of Kendo tournaments, or information from conferences.  Usually things I don't write blog posts about.</p><p>I feels good to have a handwritten account of my daily life, even though most of this information is recorded elsewhere.  It's all in one place in this book, and easy to reference.</p><p>It's really good for evaluation.  It also proves to the other teachers how much you think about the quality of your lessons, and how you might improve them.  Many teachers have done the whole <span class='ja'>すごい</span> thing after taking a look.</p><p>Beyond that, it's a great keepsake for the future after I'm done here.  I can look back and recall daily events I had forgotten. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Homework</b></div><p>As I've gotten more and more confident teaching in classrooms, and thinking more and more about what I can do for the students to learn better, I began introducing homework into my class.</p><p>The focus of teaching English in elementary school is communication.  We are to get the students to talk, to learn some things, and to get super comfortable with the idea of the language before shoving it down their throats in junior high school.  English in elementary school is not graded in any official manor.  Teachers obviously make notes about the students, and talk to them about participation, but it doesn't really matter.</p><p>But with the focus on communication, listening and speaking, elementary education is missing out on half of what makes up a language: reading and writing.  ALTs aren't supposed to teach it, blah blah blah, but it's still very important.  </p><p>Well, I teach that to the students outside of class in the form of homework.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I give students these vocabulary sheets at the start of each lesson after I've introduced all the new words.  Then at home, they can practice writing out the words.  They can practice reading them, too.  If they've completed the homework, then I reward them with a sticker. :)</p><p>Homework extends my reach as a teacher outside of class.  Students can continue the lesson, and continue to learn and practice the contents.  Also, my homework tends to list out of the contents of the lesson, so students have a clear account of what's expected of them.  The text book does not do this at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I am</b></div><p>This is what I've been doing for the past year and a half.</p><p>As the <span class='ja'>平成</span>26 school year comes to a close, for the first time, I have a full picture of an entire school year from start to finish.  I can start thinking about how other lessons in the book relate to each other.  And I can think about how I can further build that tool box throughout the entire year, rather than just a lesson at a time.  And how I can write lessons that keep students coming back to their tool box.</p><p>But before that, there is a fundamental problem with my current lesson plans.  </p><div class='title'><b>Actual Collaboration?</b></div><p>Elementary school English is meant to be team taught by the home room teacher and ALT.  I've been running the show the entire time, and not giving the teacher a chance to teach, or even learn themselves.  Usually they relegate themselves to the side or back of the room, and watch the class along with the students.  They tend to keep the peace, and help out students, too, but it's a very secondary role in class.</p><p>This is bad because if and when I leave a school, I will leave a massive hole.  New ALTs are completely inexperienced in almost all aspects of teaching.  I was an absolutely wreck in the beginning.  Current teachers won't necessarily know how to continue my lessons because I'm doing everything myself.  New ALTs won't know what to do, either, and teachers will have a difficult time keeping class together at first.</p><p>My teaching style needs to teach the teachers, too.  I need to give them confidence to teach English just as much as I do.  I need to start focusing on team teaching, and for the next year I'm rewriting my lesson plans to do exactly that.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I'm going</b></div><p>Here are my new lesson plans for <span class='ja'>平成</span>27, 2015.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYTRVNW90eDJXdFk/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYTRVNW90eDJXdFk/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-self-intro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-self-intro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-self-intro.webp" /></a></div></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MMnkxaEJERzlhOFU/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MMnkxaEJERzlhOFU/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-lesson-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-lesson-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-lesson-1.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These are the exact same lessons from earlier, but with the addition of 3 more columns.</p><p>There's an ALT column, and an HRT column.  These two columns detail exactly what our responsibilities will be during class, and how we can work together.  The ＊ depicts the lead for each section.</p><div class='title'><b>Goals</b></div><p>There's also a goal and purpose column which was sorely missed from my previous plans.  This is actually something required for writing lesson plans that I had never included before.  For each part of the lesson, I'm essentially justifying why I'm doing it, and what I expect the students to get out of it.  </p><p>This is a massive boon as it helps the HRT understand why I'm doing what I'm doing.  Additionally, when writing the plan, it helps me think of more meaningful contents for the lesson, and allows me to get rid of useless, time wasting components.</p><p>Obviously flow is still important.  Lessons can't all be meat.  There still needs to be some fluff to give the meat more meaning.  But this column simply states that everything is in here for a reason.  No bullshit.</p><p>This is all personified in the middle of the document with the Aim.  The Aim is a catch-phrase for the goal of the lesson, which is further detailed underneath.  I plan on writing out the aim on the board for each lesson.  Hopefully this will give more clarity to the students about what is going on in class.</p><div class='title'><b>Syllabus</b></div><p>I've also rewritten my syllabus.  Now that I've been through an entire school year, and can look back, I tried to write something that shows the relationships between each lesson as they go forward.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MV2ZNdU9tZHBsTWs/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MV2ZNdU9tZHBsTWs/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-syllabus.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-syllabus.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-syllabus.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Each column is a micro version of each lesson that includes the bullet points, and the contents I intend to teach.  If those contents are used in the next lesson, I try to show that relationship.  This is amazing for teachers to understand where things are going, and how to get there.</p><p>Also, they can see everything I plan on teaching for the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>Website - Backend</b></div><p>All of my lesson plans and materials are already hosted on this website, but now I'm making that more apparent by including a URL at the bottom of every plan.  If teachers are missing an old plan, they can easily retrieve the file.</p><p>If some ALT in the future finds a single plan and wants to know more, they can do so.  I've rewritten my entire ALT materials page to be more front facing, and easily to get at the actual files.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="/old/v7/lessons" title="/lessons">theschlock.com/lessons</a>!</p><p>Along with the plans and materials, I have a blog post attached writing out all of thoughts about why I did what I did, what went into making the materials, and how each class actually went.  The good, the bad.  The surprises, the boredom.  And the results.  Plenty of pictures, too. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Successor</b></div><p>Through writing plans in this way, and pointing them back to my website, hopefully I can more properly educate my incoming successor when I leave.  Hopefully they can understand the flow of class, and how to manage it, and the amount of work needed to make their classes effective.</p><p>At the end of the <span class='ja'>平成</span>27 school year, I'll have an entire book created and ready to hand off.</p><div class='title'><b>Homework</b></div><p>As I've continued to get more confident giving out homework, there's really no reason I shouldn't do this more often.  If we're doing an interview in class, I think it's a great idea to give the students an extra sheet, and have them interview their parents, other family members, or teachers.  Using their newly learned language outside of class should really be the goal from the start.</p><p>These sheets can have more writing practice, too.  They can actually practice writing sentences, and use the grammar in a written way.</p><div class='title'><b>Time Investment</b></div><p>All of this does take some time to complete.  My <span class='ja'>平成</span>26 plans can take up to 20 or 30 minutes to write.  Though, I've been able to bang them out in 10 minutes if I know exactly what I plan to do.</p><p>For <span class='ja'>平成</span>27, I've only written those 2 plans thus far.  The first one took about an hour and a half, but I was also experimenting and organizing the format of the document, too.  I wrote the second plan as more of a proof of concept for my layout.  That one took 40 minutes.</p><p>With the increased detail and thought, I expect each of these new plans to take more than twice as long to create.</p><div class='title'><b>Legitimacy</b></div><p>But I think the benefits FAR outweigh any discomfort of having to actually do the job.  Writing lesson plans in this way makes you look incredibly professional.  You like an actual legitimate teacher, and the other teachers start treating you that way too, rather than some gaijin clown hired only to entertain the kids.</p><p>And the pattern is cyclical.  You begin to feel more confident in your job.  You feel like a legitimate teacher, and that your presence in these school is actual valid, and justified.  You feel proud of your work.</p><p>I certainly feel proud of this work.</p><div class='title'><b>Back to the Present</b></div><p>We have two weeks left in this school year, and then everything begins again.  I think the school year starts on April 6th, or 7th, or something.</p><p>Currently, I'm quite far behind with putting my lesson plans on the site.  I plan on catching up with that over Spring Break.  And there's a few more updates I plan on making to the lesson pages, too.</p><p>Hopefully everyone finds something useful out of these plans, and can further improve their teaching because of it. Obviously using someone else's plans is almost impossible.  So much of myself, my teaching style, and my thought process are put into these plans.  Every teacher has a different style, different personality, and a different way of things that work for them.</p><p>I wouldn't suggest someone use these plans directly, but if you find something interesting or useful, write those ideas into your own plans.  It doesn't take much work to write your own, in your own voice, with your teaching style in mind.</p><p>Or, hell, use the plans directly if you want. :)  You know you.  Good Luck.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to バッジとれ〜るセンター" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/3ds-badge-capturing-center">バッジとれ〜るセンター</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Though, <span class='ja'>とれる</span> could be "catch", "take", or "collect".  It basically refers the action in a UFO machine, or crane game when you get something.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSPhE3zckZcQ.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSPhE3zckZcQ.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSPhE3zckZcQ.webp" /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSyUoB84lBR2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSyUoB84lBR2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSyUoB84lBR2.webp" /></p><p>Badge Center is free on the eShop in Japan.  It was just recently released, too!  It came out on December 17th, 2014.  Here's the website: <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/eshop/jwvj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/eshop/jwvj/index.html">http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/eshop/jwvj/index.html</a>  </p><p>In this game, you control a UFO machine and get a bunch of badges.  These badges can be placed on your home screen, and it turn it into something amazing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" /></p><p>This is my current home screen.  I have my game cart on the left.  Street Pass, Badge Center, and my current Picross game on the right.  And then that folder with the rest of my games.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin</b></div><p>When you start up the game, you're greeted by that shifty rabbit who sold you those Street Pass games, and he rolls you through the process.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" /></p><p>Ya know, now that I actually look at this photo, he ends his sentences with <span class='ja'>っす</span> for no real reason.  It seems like Japanese characters tend to do this a lot.  Not necessarily <span class='ja'>っす</span>, but some kind of sentence suffix.  I think it's intended to make the character sound cute.  I guess…</p><p>After his spiel, you are presented with a couple different machines.  There's the practice machine <span class='ja'>本当りつき</span>！<span class='ja'>練習キャッチャー</span>, badge catcher <span class='ja'>バッジキャッチャー</span>, Miiverse, theme shop <span class='ja'>テームショップ</span>, and information <span class='ja'>インフォメーション</span>.</p><p>What you want, what everyone wants, is the badge catcher.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS5V8RbIQ4sP.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS5V8RbIQ4sP.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS5V8RbIQ4sP.webp" /></p><p>Inside this option, you can switch around between several different machine with badges.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSl6wrgbkcoO.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSl6wrgbkcoO.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSl6wrgbkcoO.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSqH8YdhD93K.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSqH8YdhD93K.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSqH8YdhD93K.webp" /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSXNg55bZwQO.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSXNg55bZwQO.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSXNg55bZwQO.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSe0UhjxCNqq.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSe0UhjxCNqq.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSe0UhjxCNqq.webp" /></p><p>There's the typical UFO catching style using the crane.  Those Famicom badges use that style.  For those underground Mario badges, those games use the hammer.  The hammer is something new they introduced in the past two weeks.  And it does just what you'd expect.  The hammer lowers they smacks whatever is underneath, sends badges flying, and then several of the badges fall down and are caught.</p><p>But HERE is perhaps the problem..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" /></p><p>In order to play this game, you must give them money.  5 plays for 90<span class='ja'>円</span> (90 cents).  You can change those options to 10 for 180<span class='ja'>円</span>, or 15 for 270<span class='ja'>円</span>, but there are no deals.  This is why I hesitated to play this game in the first place.  You can receive free plays, though.  </p><p>Every day, you have access to the practice machine one time.  You get 5 plays on the practice machine.  When you catch badges in this machine, they build towards a counter.  Every 10 catches will get you 3 free plays on the regular machines.  Every time you catch the hidden targeted badge, you get 3 free plays on the regular machines.</p><p>5 plays is a pretty good number, though.  I've been able to completely clear machines (at least with the hammer) in 3 to 6 plays.  In one case, I was able to clear a whole screen in one try.</p><div class='title'><b>Rotation</b></div><p>The contents of these UFO machines change every single day.  If you take a look at those Famicom pics again, <span class='ja'>今日で終了</span> means "ends today."  Tomorrow, there will be different badges in their place.  Those Famicom games weren't there yesterday either.  Yesterday, they introduced a bunch of Tomodachi Life items.  The day before that, they had Majora's Mask items.</p><p>From what I can tell, there have been the following series of items: Animal Crossing, Tomodachi Life, Famicom, Mario Kart 8, Zelda Majora's Mask, Zelda Link Between Words, Rhythm Heaven, 8-bit Mario, and regular Mario.  Those 8-bit Super Mario Bros sprites have a whole lot of variations.  Currently there are underground sprites, but there's been overworld ones, clouds, castle, Christmas, and some business suit ones, too.  Actually, right now they have some limited Animal Crossing badges for Hina Matsuri, which is a national holiday in Japan (March 3rd).</p><div class='title'><b>Themes</b></div><p>Additionally, if you spend at least 180<span class='ja'>円</span> in a single day, you get a free theme for your home screen.  All of these themes fit a category of badge.  I spent the money, and got that Mario underground theme, so I can closely recreate a Mario level.  These rotate, too.  Today, there was a Mario Kart 8 theme.</p><p>There are also badges which replace the standard 3DS apps (like the eShop, Street Pass, etc) so your home screen can still have a lot of functionality.  I've only been playing this game since Thursday, so I haven't gotten those yet.</p><div class='title'><b>Ornamental Goods</b></div><p>The idea of selling ornamental goods is not a new thing.  But it has never felt right.  It has always felt shady.</p><p>For the 3DS, this began last year with the sale of themes.  You would spend $1 or $2, and it would change the image and colors of things on your home screen.  There were free themes, too, but those were just solid colors.</p><p>When I originally found out about this game, I thought it was just a new level of this nonsense.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" /></p><p>This is what my screen looks like before.  Super clean, everything accessible.  My American 3DS home screen looks similar.  If I got a couple of badges in the game, where would I put them?  What would I do?  My home screen would be littered with a bunch of non-function garbage that didn't really fit at all.</p><p>Then I got this Club Nintendo theme which looked really nice.  It was 20 points through Club Nintendo. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" /></p><p>It changed the folders to Famicom carts, and made 8-bit sounds when you navigated the menu.  It was nice, and I figured those Famicom badges would actually fit with theme, and perhaps look good.</p><p>I downloaded the game, and went through the tutorial.  The first 17 or 20 minutes of this game is on Youtube, by the way.  That video shows you exactly what you're getting into.</p><p>Again, I started playing this game on Thursday.  And on Thursday, those Famicom badge weren't available in the rotation.  Bah, annoying.  I played the practice machine, and got some free plays.  With those plays, I got my first underground Mario badges.  Then, through the hammer tutorial, I got some more Mario badges.</p><p>Why not?  I dumped in 90<span class='ja'>円</span>, played again, and got a ton more badges.  Then I did it again so I could get the free theme.  And I got plenty more badges, too.  Enough to create that underground scene from earlier.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" /></p><p>The "free" themes are what really make the badges come alive.  Without a theme, using these particular sprites makes the home screen look like garbage.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEQc3UYAADk8Q.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEQc3UYAADk8Q.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEQc3UYAADk8Q.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEW3QU8AAkDy4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEW3QU8AAkDy4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEW3QU8AAkDy4.webp" /></p><p>Actually, maybe that Club Nintendo theme could work with a few changes.</p><p>I have dropped a total of 900<span class='ja'>円</span> ($9) into this game over the last 3 days.  I've captured ALL the underground sprites, and then I got all the Famicom badges which appeared today.  Ugh, I'm so dumb.</p><p>I have enough badges now to create a Mario level that extends all the way to the right, taking up the entire home screen.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eIXKkVEAAY6zb_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eIXKkVEAAY6zb_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eIXKkVEAAY6zb_stitch.webp" /></p><p>I put all my Famicom badges into the folder with the rest of my games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eMGPiU0AAmdIX.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eMGPiU0AAmdIX.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eMGPiU0AAmdIX.webp" /></p><p>Those hearts are from one of the Zelda Majora's Mask machines.</p><div class='title'><b>Inventory</b></div><p>Every badge you capture is just a single sprite (or a block of sprites) which takes up a single tile on the home screen.  For example, each one of those coins are an individual badge I've captured in the game.  You do not have infinite stock.  Though, apparently once you've gotten 100 of a single badge, the counter turns to a star.  Maybe then it's infinite.</p><p>To place badges on the screen, click the settings in the corner.  The badge menu shows up directly under the theme menu.  From there, you pull badges from your menu, and place them on your home screen.  Also, "opening" a badge on the home screen always brings up the badge menu.</p><div class='title'><b>Bleh</b></div><p>My home screen looks pretty awesome, but I feel like all this is taking advantage of that part in my brain that just can't say No to collecting crap.  And now, I want to get more Mario sprites and build more levels within folders.  I would LOVE to get some Zelda sprites, too, and some other 8-bit games.  Maybe some Pokemon badges...  Ugh stop!</p><p>Man, I don't like this.  It's a bunch of 3DS "hats"!</p><p>Showing off your home screen to other people is about the extent of the worth.  But that continues the cycle of making it viral.</p><p>I don't think they've made any announcement about this game coming to the US (or other territories), but the user base in Japan has surpassed 1 million unique users.  I wonder how much money they've made from this.  If each person spent $1, they've made a million dollars on practically nothing.  It's gotta come over here eventually, right?</p><p>The Miiverse for this is QUITE active with tons of variations.<br/><a href="https://miiverse.nintendo.net/titles/14866558073507549188/14866558073507549199" title="https://miiverse.nintendo.net/titles/14866558073507549188/14866558073507549199">https://miiverse.nintendo.net/titles/14866558073507549188/14866558073507549199</a></p><p>Anyway, there you have it!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150307_badge/IMG_4582_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150307_badge/IMG_4582_t.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150307_badge/IMG_4582_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150307_badge/IMG_4582_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150307_badge/IMG_4582_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Mario Bros.

Goombas are Kuribo <span class='ja'>クリボー</span>.  Koopa Troopas are Nokonoko <span class='ja'>ノコノコ</span>, which is an uncommon Japanese word for unconcerned, or nonchalant.

We are completely surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the country, but there are plenty more low lying mountains standing above us.  Towards the end of summer, I became interested in hiking some the nearby mountains, and seeing our town from above, and had plenty success.  I wanted to hike during the winter to see the seasonal differences, and yesterday finally had great weather to do it.</p><p>I decided to hike Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span>, a mountain I had already hiked once before on <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">September 20th</a>.  It's probably the highest mountain nearest the center of Takayama, and it has a great view of the Shingu <span class='ja'>新宮</span> neighborhood, and some of the downtown Takayama, too.</p><p>Harayama was one of the easiest hikes I did over last summer, and you can drive quite near the peak.  In winter, things were much different.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, with the heavy snow we received <a href="/old/v7/december-snow" title="/december-snow">last December</a>, many of the trees lining the mountain pass had collapsed, blocking the road.  It was completely blocked only 100 or 200 meters from Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨のさと</span>.</p><p>Several other cars had parked near the block, so I did the same.  I parked my car, and began my hike.</p><div class='title'><b>Walking to the Parking Area</b></div><p>I wasn't too worried since I had already hiked this area once before.  I knew the distance I needed to travel.  However, hiking in snow was WAY more difficult than I thought it would be, and there was a lot of damage from that December snowstorm that had not yet been cleaned up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I began by following the mountain road leading up to the parking area.  There was a path already laid out in the snow by previous hikers throughout the season.  A clear path of foot prints had packed down the snow, and created a frozen platform able to hold my weight.  Most of the time.  </p><p>Whenever I slightly veered off the course, I would sink in the unpacked snow.  Even sometimes the course itself wouldn't be able to hold my weight.  It would collapse, and I would sink in the snow.  Just like this:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was still deep enough to sink past my knees.  My typical pace would be walking, walking, walking, sink, walking, walking, walking, sink.  It wasn't so bad at first.  I would usually leap out of the hole while I sank, and catch my balance.  But after doing this numerous times, the exercise began to wear on me.  And every time I sunk in the snow was a short little break.</p><p>I took plenty of breaks taking photos, too.  Also, I probably stopped every 2 or 3 minutes, to take in the beautiful snow covered scenery and snap several photos.</p><p>There were plenty of downed trees as well.  The first couple of trees were easy to duck under, but there were several just too big to hop over, and difficult to tell if I could actually go under.  It can became very clear that this hike was not a simple leisurely stroll.  Several of these trees, I had to actually crawl under in order to pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In addition to the road, there were hiking trails that went the exact same direction and several times passed the road.  I was getting sick of sinking in the snow every 10 or 20 feet, so I changed paths to the hiking trails at my next opportunity.  The trails had slightly less snow, and nearly all of its had been very well packed down.</p><p>But, this presented a new challenge.  The snow was packed so well, and so uniform that was nothing for my shoes to grip.  And the hiking trail was MUCH more vertical than the mountain road.  Now, I was constantly slipping at the most modest of inclines.  Towards the end of the trail as it crossed the road again, I was basically crawling my way up, and tearing through the outer edges of the ice into the snow.</p><p>Ugh, fuck that.  I'm going back to the snow.</p><p>I was one leg away from reaching the parking area, and the shelter came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Things got way worse.  At this point, way more hikers had used the trail, so the path of the road was much more narrow and weak.  Nearly every five steps, I sank into the snow, had to pull myself out, and then sink again.  I was taking a break almost every minute due to exhaustion.  As exhaustion continued, I became too lazy or tired to keep myself from fully falling into the snow.  The snow was nice and soft. :)</p><p>But I continued, and ripped through the snow.  Another hiker came into view, and heard me crunching through the snow.  He basically just stood there and stared at me like I was some kind of idiot as I continually sank in the snow, and running out of breath.  I said <span class='ja'>こんにちは</span> to which I received a belated response.  Then he talked with me for a little while.  We had actually met before.  He worked at City Hall, and we met at one of those social events they have.  I didn't remember him at all.</p><p>He asked what my destination was, and I replied <span class='ja'>たぶんここです</span> (maybe right here), but then later said I was planning on going to the summit.  He had just come from the summit, and said it would probably take about 30 minutes.  Yeah well, it had already taken me 40 minutes just to get here.  I guessed that with the current season, maybe 50 minutes was more accurate.  I mentioned I had hiked here before and knew the area, so while he may had tried to convince me to give up, he basically gave up, and wished me well.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing to the Temple</b></div><p>From the parking area, there are two paths to reach the summit: the high path, and the low path, the difficult path, and the easy path.  I took the low easy path.  During the summer, the high path was annoying.  I couldn't imagine how painful it would be now.</p><p>The low path leads directly to the Kannon Temple where they do the horse paintings near the end of summer.  From there, it was a straight descent to the summit.  The descent worried me, but covering over a kilometer on level terrain, then putting all the bullshit at the end seemed easier to tackle.</p><p>I put on my gloves, and continued forward.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several ups and downs, and I sank in the snow fairly often, but it wasn't that bad.  It was no where near as exhausting as that last leg of the climb up.</p><p>Plenty of downed trees covered the path, so several times I had to get down on the ground at crawl through.  Many times I surprised myself with just how low I was able to go.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I mean, look at the trees in the above picture.  It looks totally impassable.  But just take one tree at a time.  Go up, go down, left, right, left, right, a, b, start.  And you're fine.</p><p>Man, this path seemed to take longer and longer.  Each time I reached a bend, I thought it would be the last, but it just turned around into more trail.  Several signs marked the path, and the distance continued to shrink.  800m, 550m, 300m.</p><p>Eventually, I reached the bend I remembered, lined with Matsukura-yama <span class='ja'>松倉山</span> flags.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the foot of the entrance was a running stream of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3902.webp">water to drink from</a>.

Now on top of that was tons of snapped branches, downed trees, and 3 months of snowfall totaling more than 3 feet.</p><p>There were very few parts of the trek that were stable.  This time when I sank in the snow, my single leg would sink down near my waist.  And it would usually scratch against broken branches, or rock.  Sinking was really no longer just a funny oopsie-daisy.  It could actually damage my leg if I were moving fast into it, or if I wasn't paying attention.</p><p>This became any actual climb now.  I was using my arms to stabilize my weight, and pull myself up some areas.  Many times, I kicked away holes near the edges of the ice packed path to grab a foot hold.  </p><p>It was pretty rough, but really energizing, and motivating.  This seriously was the final push towards the summit.  It was the last obstacle before the finish line.  And I was making VERY visible progress.

I climbed that mountain last year, too: <a href="/old/v7/ibuseyama" title="/ibuseyama">September 3rd</a>.  It would be amazing to climb that mountain now, but it would be way too difficult.  It's also very remote, so it's much more dangerous for me to go alone.  There is a home up there, though, so maybe it's plowed.</p><div class='title'><b>Heading back to the car</b></div><p>Anyway, I took my photos, enjoyed the view, but had to begin my descent.  I needed to be somewhere at 2pm, and it had already taken me 2 hours to reach my current position.</p><p>Going back down was WAY easier than the climb up.  For the super slick icy parts, I could bend down and use my shoes to sled across the path.  I was so close to the ground, that falling didn't matter, and I could easily control my descent breaking with my arms in the snow.</p><p>I glided past Anvil Rock.  Going through the valley of snow wasn't as slick, but getting out of a sink hole was way easier going backwards.

The first leg of the trail was another 40 or 45 degree slope.  I sat on my feet, and zoomed straight down.  Whee!</p><p>What probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to traverse earlier via the road, took me less than 5 minutes to sled down via the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty fun. :)  I continued sledding down the trails whenever I could.  After a while, the trails began to even out.  I was no longer able to sled, so I stuck with the roads, and keep on the icy path.</p><p>At last, I arrived back to my car almost an hour after I left the summit.  What took me 2 hours to climb, took me only an hour to descend.  Sure, I wasn't taking nearly as many pictures, and gravity was on my side, but that's still a huge gain in speed.</p><p>My gloves were completely soaked from the snow, and my inner clothes were completely soaked from sweat.  I brought some extra clothes with, so I changed into something dry before leaving the area.</p><p>Before heading to my appointment at 2pm, I drove through the Shingu neighborhood to take a reverse photo looking at the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's really not that much to look at from below, but from the top everything looks amazing.</p><p>The summit is that open area near the top.  The hill underneath also has a trail leading to the summit, but that was not the one I took.  In hindsight, it may have been faster, and definitely a shorter distance, but there's no temple, or anvil rock on that path.</p><div class='title'><b>Winter <span class='ja'>冬</span> and Summer <span class='ja'>夏</span></b></div><p>Of course, the reason I choose my path was to specifically compare the environments I had experienced in the summer to now.  I probably should've prepared more for this, but I got a few photos pretty close.

The clouds, fog, and snow stop mid-afternoon, and sky opens wide to allow the sun to say goodbye for the day.  The other night, I noticed some rather bright objects in the sky.  Usually, if you have to see a "star" that is WAY brighter than most, it's actually a planet.  And it definitely was.</p><p>I was witnessing an uncommon event where our view of both Venus and Mars were coming close to each other, and eventually Venus would overlap Mars, blocking it from view.  In addition, our view of the Moon also comes close to cross paths with the two planets and almost overlaps their view.  This was last Friday night.  I wish I would've been setup for it.</p><p>Tonight was the first clear night since then, so I went to the top of Kita-yama around 6:45pm, nearly 2 hours after sunset to take some photos.  Something else celestial was happening at that time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The International Space Station</b></div><p>At exactly 6:45pm, the ISS came into view in the Northwest sky.  It raced across the sky.  Then it set in the South.  Ever since <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">the eclipse</a> last year, I signed up for NASA's Spot the Station service.  Here's the link: <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</a></p><p>Spot the Station was send you an email in the morning if the International Space Station happens to fly over head the coming night.  Just enter your email and location, and you're good for a year.  It's incredibly accurate.  It will tell you the exact date it will come into range, which direction in the night sky to look, and how long it will be visible.  Here's the email I got today:</p><p><code>Time: Tue Feb 24 6:45 PM, Visible: 5 min, Max Height: 55 degrees, Appears: WNW, Disappears: SSE</code></p><p>The station appears as a white dot in the sky and moves and a steady pace.  It makes no sound, and no visible trail.  You might think it was an airplane, but it's just a single light, and it's not blinking.  And then it disappears over some trees.

It takes about 2 hours to make it to the area, and between here and there are the western peaks of the Japanese Alps.  Half of the journey is using the smooth and fast Tollway.  </p><p>The second half is taking a narrow winding road that follows the outline of the mountains and the lakes and rivers their runoff have created.  On a chill clear February morning, it looks beautiful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For a couple of days this year, we've had this amazing clear weather with absolutely no clouds in the sky.  The sky a deep blue, and all the surrounding mountains completely visible.  At night, every star in the star can be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>We stopped twice to take some photos along the mountain road.  This was along Lake Kuzuryu <span class='ja'>九頭竜湖</span> still east of the village Kuzuryu <span class='ja'>九頭竜</span>.  Kelly pointed out that kanji stands for 9 <span class='ja'>九</span> + Head <span class='ja'>頭</span> + Dragon <span class='ja'>竜</span>.

We reached Ono, and headed north to the Dinosaur museum in Katsuyama City.  After which, we went to Katsuyama Castle.</p><div class='title'><b>Katsuyama Castle <span class='ja'>勝山城</span></b></div><p>It was later in the day, and clouds began to disrupt the clear blue sky. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Katsuyama Castle is an incredibly visible building on the side of the main road between Katsuyama and Ono.  It's very easy to park and gain access.  Today it sits next to acres of farmland and rice fields.  Even back in the day, the setting would not be all that different.</p><p>It's unnatural.</p><p>Most Japanese castles sit on a mountain of rock laid by human hands, surrounded by castle walls and other towers and small buildings within the courtyard.  A castle isn't really a single building, but a center point of an entire complex, which, in turn, is usually the center point of an entire town.</p><p>The current structure labeled Katsuyama Castle is indeed unnatural.  According to the Internet, this is not its original location.  This building was built in 1992 by a successful and wealthy local who wanted to give something back to their hometown.  Apparently this whole thing cost around $70 million.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The whole thing is very ornamental, too.  It feels no where near as authentic as most castles you might visit.

Almost everywhere in the U.S., they are sold out.  Even the common ones can be tough to find.  And the uncommon and rare ones?  They sell pretty well on eBay.</p><p>In Japan, though...  they are not so scarce.  And after returning from winter vacation, I've been buying the ones difficult to find and reselling them on eBay.  An alternate title for this entry might be <b>Confessions of an Amiibo Scalper</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Amiibo</b></div><p>First, What are Amiibos?  Amiibos are these things:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are figurines of Nintendo characters created by Nintendo.  But in addition to being a figurine, each one has a chip in its based and can be used with various games on the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.  The most prominent game being the new Super Smash Brothers title.</p><p>The first wave of these figures was released in November last year.  However, given Nintendo's risk aversion and general misunderstanding of their demographic and fan base, they did not create enough figures to match demand, and certain figures became incredibly rare quite fast, and extremely difficult to find.  Additionally, this was on the heals of Christmas, so they became quite a hot item, and demand continued to increase.</p><p>That's in the U.S., though.  In Japan, most people don't care that much about video games.  The 3DS is pretty popular, and most kids have those.  But most families do not have home consoles because they're expensive, and take over the family TV which should be shared by everyone.  Also, kids don't really care about Smash Brothers.  They're more interested in Yokai Watch and Monster Hunter.  So, Amiibos aren't selling nearly as much as the states.  Also, I think they've shipped more in Japan, than in the states (at least per capita).</p><p>Before winter vacation, I spent some time reading about all the horror stories of gamers trying to get their hands on these things.  I thought, really?  A few weeks prior I saw a full display of (maybe) all the figures at a Toys R Us.  The prices on eBay seemed to corroborate with the stories.  Some figures were selling for 3 times their MRSP.  One in particular, <i>The Villager</i>, was closer to 7 times.  Amiibo figures retail for $12.</p><p>After coming back to Japan from winter vacation, I hopped on the Amiibo bandwagon purely to resell them on eBay.</p><div class='title'><b>Waves</b></div><p>At that time, there had been 2 release waves of figures.  From the first wave, <i>The Villager</i>, <i>Marth</i>, and <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i> were the uncommon or rare figures.  Though, I think <i>Samus</i>, and <i>Fox</i> are getting hard to find now.  From the second wave, <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> became quickly scarce.  <i>Captain Falcon</i> is starting to get rare, too.</p><p>In Tokyo, before returning to Takayama, I went to a few Toys R Us's and other stores, and easily found plenty <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I could not find any <i>Villagers</i>, though.  Those were actually rare in Japan, too.  After returning to Takayama, I found a <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Captain Falcon</i>, plus plenty more <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I've never seen a <i>Pitt</i>, either.</p><p>In January, Nintendo released their third wave of figures.  These figures would be released in the U.S. a few weeks later.  But, in the U.S., four of these figures were retailer exclusive, meaning you couldn't figure them just anywhere.  That was not the case in Japan.  These figures were <i>Rosalina</i> exclusive to Target, <i>Lucario</i> exclusive to Toys R Us, <i>Meta Knight</i> exclusive to Best Buy, and <i>Shulk</i> exclusive to Gamestop.  These seemed like they would be the most difficult to find in the states, so when they released in Japan, I bought plenty of each.  (Shulk has yet to release in Japan, though.)</p><div class='title'><b>Buying in Rural Japan</b></div><p>In large cities, you have tons of options, but out here in the forest and the mountains, the choices are much more limited.  Takayama isn't all that bad, though.  We have a Geo <span class='ja'>ゲオ</span>, and an Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span>.  Both stores have full displays of Amiibos and received full shipments of Wave 3.  Apita <span class='ja'>アピタ</span> has 'em, too, but seemed like they only received half a shipment of Wave 3.  That rental store in Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> occasionally has some, too.</p><p>Here's the display at my local Edion, taken on Sunday.  They had plenty of the common figures, and a few of the uncommon ones.  This is in STARK contrast to any shelves in America where only <i>Peach</i> can easily be found.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This weekend, I decided to drive around the Hida <span class='ja'>飛騨</span> area and raid all the stores for their rare and uncommon Amiibo figures.  I drove south to Gero, then west to Gujo, and quickly further south to Seki.</p><div class='title'><b>Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span></b></div><p>Still within the Hida region, comprising the southern towns and villages is Gero City, with Hagiwara <span class='ja'>萩原</span>, and Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span> being its population centers.

And in Gero, there's another Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span> with a Neverland.  These distinctions are important.

That's not particularly huge, but the boon is being able to convert my yen into dollars, and being able to transfer that into my back account.  This is amazing, and if I can sell enough of these things in a month, it totally mitigates my need to send money back to the U.S..</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think this is a renewable resource.  It's good for now.  I'll be able to make some cash in the short term.  But supply will continue to dwindle here in Japan.  And perhaps Nintendo will get its shit together and meet demand.  Who knows?  Best to strike while I can.</p><div class='title'><b>Lifetime Sales</b></div><p>It's been almost 7 years since I started selling things on eBay on a regular basis.  It started with a bunch of extra video games, movies, and action figures I had in my possession and no longer cared about.  I've written about this several times in the past.

I've spent the money on music and artists.  I've bought plenty of games, too.  Ultimately, it's just trading old stuff for new stuff.  Getting rid of the stuff that doesn't matter, and keeping what does.</p><p>I found my lifetime sales total on ebay the other day.  As of Sunday, February 8th, I've made nearly $10,000 reselling crap on eBay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, eBay doesn't really keep user records further back than 3 months, so there's no way to see a breakdown of this number.  I would love to see a chart of my highs and lows throughout the past decade.  At one point, I was selling so many things that I actually became a top seller. It didn't last long since my supply was never all that large.  I was only a top seller for 3 months (2 of which were the grace period at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I should easily top $10,000 by the end of the week.  Also, I'm getting pretty close to Top Seller status again thanks to Amiibo.

Posted in

| January 31, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After thinking about things quite a bit, I finally decided to buy a Japanese Nintendo 3DS XL.  One of the "New" ones, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were plenty pros and cons I've dealt with for a while.  For the record, the Nintendo 3DS is a region locked system, so I'm unable to play Japanese games on my American 3DS.  Likewise, I cannot play my American games on this one.  Nor, can I really exchange data of any kind between the two handhelds on a system level.  Though, nearly all games internally don't care about exchanging data.</p><div class='title'><b>The Cons</b></div><p>I had two big reasons that kept preventing me from outright buying this for a while.  One was the lack of games.  Any 3DS game I was interested in was almost guaranteed to make it to the U.S.  So I could simply wait, and buy it later.  The second reason was the language barrier.  Even if there were a game I wanted that didn't make it to the states, it would mostly likely be story-based or have mechanics where not totally understanding the language would get in my way.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>I continued to think more and more about that second point.  Everyday I deal with problems learning Japanese, and effectively communicating with those around me.  It weighs on me most days.  When I get home, I want to relax and just turn everything off in my head.  I usually do this by playing games, and I don't want to see anymore Japanese while I'm basically trying to get away from it.  Sometimes there's just too much being shoved into my brain at once.</p><p>Other foreigners living here face similar problems.  It continually builds and builds until you NEED to get out.  You need a break, a vacation.  Going back home over Christmas really let me recharge.  The same with visiting Okinawa last year.  I guess it's technically being "Home Sick" but it's not really that I want to go back home.  I just miss the variety, or the ability to actually understand people, and be effective in society.</p><p>Anyway, I just got back from vacation, so I've been recharged.  And many of my recent clashes with Japanese have turned out somewhat successful.  I'm using Google Translate FAR LESS on webpages these days.  When talking with other teachers, I rarely need to pull out my dictionary.  And with the Japanese I'm studying, I'm able to consistently read things and only misunderstand a few vocabulary words.</p><p>I am improving and am getting better, even though I'm still terrible at it.  So, the thought of having to tackle Japanese in games, and for fun, no longer seemed like con.  Really, it was now a reason <b>for</b> buying it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Pros</b></div><p>Having another venue for studying and practicing Japanese now joined my list of pros, which was really just a list of games I wanted to play.  These games include <b>Game Center CX 3</b>, <b>Yokai Watch</b>, the <b>Picross</b> games that haven't come to the U.S., and the eventually 3rd Gen VI <b>Pokemon</b> game, whether it be Pokemon Z or Pokemon Delta Emerald.</p><p><b>Yokai Watch</b> is massive in Japan right now, and I have no idea (really) what it is.  I've read some articles about people explaining it.  I've read the wikipedia page about it.  And read a few other things, too.  From what I gather, it's a multi-media marketing machine similar to Pokemon.  Eventually, the whole thing boils down to the core video game, and a complementary anime.  Really underneath all the bullshit Pokemon has, it's a solid game, and people claim Yokai Watch is, too.</p><p>So, people think Yokai Watch is actually good, and I want to know more about it.  It is coming to the U.S. this year, but I want to learn about it now, and also attempt to do it in Japanese.</p><p>Also, another reason I wanted to buy it is that I actually want an upgraded 3DS.  I play my Nintendo 3DS a lot, and the updated hardware has a lot of great stuff.  The Circle Pad pro is built into it.  It has a faster processor.  The 3D is better.  It's a great update.</p><p>So, I bought it. :D  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>I took a couple photos comparing the new 3DS XL to the previous 3DS XL, plus my DSi and DS Lite, since I have those.  The 3DS game goes in the bottom now, which is kinda weird.  Same with the stylus, which I don't like, but whatever.  Additionally, you need to unscrew and remove the back faceplate to get to the SD card slot.  It's annoying, but really only needed to be done once ever.  It uses a Micro SD card now, as well.</p><p>But it feels great.  The D pad feels amazing.  The buttons feel amazing.  I haven't used the right Circle pad much yet.  There's almost no tactile feedback with that at all from what I've messed with.  In game, I'm sure it's much better.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>Also, language-wise, it has been very gratifying and confidence building how I've been able to go through menus, sign up for things, and generally understand everything that I've been doing.  The language has not once gotten in my way.</p><p>I have yet to delve into Yokai Watch, but <b>Game Center CX 3</b> is excellent so far.  And, again, I've been able to understand what has been going on in the game.  I know what the characters are talking about.  In some cases, I understand the conversations completely.  The language has not been a crutch, what-so-ever.</p><p>Though, everything is still quite within my wheel house.  I already understand the menus, and Game Center CX from using and playing the English language equivalent.  I have not done that with Yokai Watch, so that game should actually challenge my understanding of Japanese.</p><div class='title'><b>Club Nintendo Picross</b></div><p>On the digital side of things, I purchased nearly all the Picross games available on the eShop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" /></a></p><p>With my current catalogue of Japanese 3DS games I had exactly enough points to purchase Club Nintendo Picross.  Game Center CX gave me 30 points.  Yokai Watch gave me 20.  And each of the 6 Picross E games were 5 points each.  80 points exactly!</p><p>It's really odd that this game using the Picross DS "engine", rather than the upgraded Picross E.  Overall there's like 180 puzzles in the game, including 2 Mega Picross puzzles.  I wanted to make sure I was able to get this game before Club Nintendo shut down for good in the next few months.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get Club Nintendo Picross Plus, which was a Platinum reward last year, but I'll take what I can get.</p><p>For the <b>Picross E</b> games, only the first 3 made it to the U.S.  There are 3 more that came out in Japan just this past year.  Picross e6 just came out last month.  In addition, there's a second Picross Gameboy Virtual Console game only in Japan.  Whee, Picross!</p><div class='title'><b>Plenty to do</b></div><p>Well now I have plenty of new games to play, and also can actually take part in more Japanese games.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-end-2014-additions">Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| January 3, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Another year comes to close, and it has been another lucrative year for the team at Cards Against Humanity.  They've released quite a bit of new content.  At <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">PAX East</a>, they released a few new booster packs.  At PAX Prime, they released their fifth expansion.  And with Christmas passed, their new holiday expansion is now complete, too.</p><p>I'm back in the states for Christmas, and I'm able to catch up with the recent (and one not-so-recent) expansions of the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Reject Pack</b></div><p>The Reject Pack is an illusive booster pack of cards featuring some of the cut ideas for the original release of the game.  Not too long after the original release of the game, they began giving these out at various events, and giving them out as they fixed printing mistakes in their games.  They've never officially sold them, or even acknowledged their existence.</p><p>As I mentioned in that PAX East post, some company on amazon listed Reject Packs for $10.  Whether they were bootleg or not, that is absolutely the cheapest I have ever seen them offered online.  I quickly bought one, and this is the result:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cards look pretty damn good.  The card titles match what has been posted online.  I can't really say if the portraits and the reject icon are correct, but they're close enough for me.  </p><p>The card quality seems slightly cheaper than the cards offered in the fifth expansion, but the cards have the correct pressing texture.  Perhaps the quality is slightly lower because these were printed alongside the first versions of the game before the company was highly profitable?</p><p>I can't really say whether these are fake one way or the other.  They didn't come from CAH official, but there are no obvious flaws.  For me, though, they are certainly good enough to cross off my check-list. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Official Fifth Expansion & Crabs Fourth Expansion</b></div><p>More and more cards.  During PAX Prime, they officially released their fifth expansion.  A month later, Crabs released their fourth expansion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between these two expansions, you can observe the gap of humor between the official card writers at CAH, and the Crabs writers.  SO many of the Crabs cards are specific references.  Those kind of references you might find in an episode of Family Guy.  As if those kind of references are jokes in of themselves.  "Ze Germans"?  Oh yeah, I remember that from Snatch.  "www.clownpenis.fart"?  A reference to a hilarious SNL sketch, but not funny on its own.  The very last card in the expansion is a reference to Robin William's death..  </p><p>Many of the CAH cards don't really go into specifics.  They allow the audience and the players to make those connections on their own.  Really, that's the core of the humor in Cards Against Humanity.  These Crabs cards really miss the point.  They've really always missed the point.</p><div class='title'><b>10 Days (or whatever) of Kwanza</b></div><p>They did another holiday promotion in which CAH sent out several daily letters containing various things.  Each envelope detailed the story of Santa's death, and the great lizard uprising of 2352.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This year, there were a total of 11 envelopes.  The final present last year was a single white card with the recipients name on it.  This year, they got the individual cards out of the way immediately on the first day.  There was one white card, and one black card.  The second day contained magnetic stickers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The third, fourth, and fifth days contained the official 2014 holiday cards.  The themes for each set of cards were Past, Present and Future.  Between all the sets there are 30 cards.  6 black cards, and 24 white ones.</p><p>The six, seventh, and eighth days included a bunch of fun stuff: taste changing tablets, an indie card game, and web comics in print form.  </p><p>The ninth, tenth, and eleventh days were more political and satire.  The ninth day listed all the campaign contributors to some nefarious congressman from the midterm elections.  The tenth day announced their purchased of a private island, and a deed for one square foot of land on the island.  And the eleventh day was a small book of email responses.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Fun stuff.  <i>Edit:</i> The days are incorrect, but whatever.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Released Expansions</b></div><p>By the end of 2014, the following add-ons have been released for Cards Against Humanity, and are available for purchase on the CAH website.</p><p>- First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth (Official) Expansions<br/>- Christmas 2012, and Christmas 2013 (12 Days of Holiday Bullshit) Packs<br/>- The 90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>- The Bigger, Blacker Box (which includes the Box Expansion)</p><p>The following are unofficial expansions available for purchase on their respective websites:</p><p>- Crabs Adjust Humidity Volumes One, Two, Three, and Four (Unofficial)<br/>- Cards & Punishment Volume One* (Unofficial)</p><p>And the following have been released in limited quantities at various events.</p><p>- Christmas 2014 Pack (Tens Days (or Whatever) of Kwanza)<br/>- PAX East 2013, and PAX Prime 2013 Promo Packs<br/>- PWNMeal (PAX East 2014) Promo Packs<br/>- PAX East 2014, and PAX Prime 2014 Panel Packs*<br/>- The Reject Pack<br/>- The House of Cards Against Humanity Pack*<br/>- The Science Pack*<br/>- The TableTop Pack*</p><p>And, again, I have all of the above except for the ones marked with an asterisk*.  I mentioned some of those in the previous <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">post</a>, but I'll reiterate.</p><p><b>PAX Panel Packs</b> are 2 sets of 10 cards offered only to attendees of the panels at PAX East 2014 and PAX Prime 2014.  During the panel, audience members offer suggestions for cards and the best 10 cards are printed overnight, and given the audience members the next day.</p><p><b>House of Cards Against Humanity Pack</b> was a promotional item offered by Netflix for the release of House of Cards season two, which happened in February 2014.  Netflix asked CAH to make some cards, and they created 25 cards: 9 black, 16 white.  100,000 of these packs were offered for free online, and sold out within 45 minutes after Netflix tweeted about it.</p><p><b>The Science Pack</b> is another promotional item put together by CAH for the Bay Area Science Festival.  They have mentioned this will be offered online sometime in 2015.  There are 18 cards: 6 black, 12 white.</p><p><b>The TableTop Pack</b> is a promotion for the indie web show Table Top, starring Wil Wheaton, apparently.  To fund season three they setup something on IndieGoGo, and CAH offered a pack of cards for the $20 mark.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>In addition to the above expansions, I also bought a second bigger, blacker box to house my growing collection.  As mentioned before, several cards in the original sets were designed to work well with each other, but with so many expansions and unofficial expansions, those connections are lost and diluted.  There are a lot of great cards added in the expansions, but I think there are more useless ones.  I need to pair down my collection and make a great solid set of cards.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's my current collection.  For now, I separated all the cards into 3 different stacks: original cards, official expansion cards, and the unofficial expansion cards.  I think that's the best way for quality control for the time being.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/26">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/24">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
