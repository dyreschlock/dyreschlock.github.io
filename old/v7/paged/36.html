They were rocked with a 9.0 earthquake, followed by the resulting Tsunami, and currently trying to prevent a Nuclear meltdown from the damaged incurred by the earthquake and tsunami.  I wanted to write something up real quick that a lot of links to video, photos, and other information about what's going on over there.</p><p>I've been keeping a close eye on everything as Japan is quite special to me.  I have several friends living there, and I'm concerned about them.  Also, because my brother and I had a vacation scheduled from March 24th through April 5th, and I was wondering how feasible it would be to continue with those plans.  We have rescheduled our trip to sometime in May or June.</p><div class='title'><b>Earthquake</b></div><p class='img'>On March 11th, around 3pm local time, the 9.0 earthquake struck in the ocean about 100 miles east of Sendai, but the resulting aftershocks and several more earthquakes continued hours after the initial rumble.  It is tied for the 4th largest earthquake ever recorded, and the largest recorded to hit Japan.

I don't really know all the details on how a nuclear power plant works, and what they've been doing to contain it.  Reddit user dwolf12345 posted an AMA since he's a reactor operator at a US plant very similar to Fukushima<br/><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/" title="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/</a></p><p><em>"The fission reaction stops nearly instantly, however while the core is at power all the material in the core becomes INCREDIBLY radioactive. So after the fission reaction stops there is still considerable heat being generated due to radioactive decay of the fuel and other activated core components (this is called decay heat).</p><p>This is the heat that is causing the issues in Japan. It can take a day or two to cool the core down to below the boiling point even with good decay heat removal systems. As long as the vessel is kept full and the temperature brought down slowly and deliberately there is no issue at all. But take away that cooling system and the water it provides and you've got problems."</em></p><p><em>"It is very bad. No hyperbole there...nuclear plants NEED electrical power, even when shut down to ensure that the fuel stays cool. These plants were blacked out (no AC power) for 2-3 days. Normally losing off-site power is recoverable because of the on-site emergency diesel generators, however in this case they were swamped. In all likelihood they went without AC and DC power for a very long time. This means that any actions taken to stabilize the plant had to be manual(since there was no control power for remote controlling stations). They have gone deep down in their emergency plans, probably (although I am not sure of this) into their Severe Accident Management Guidelines. This means that they are beyond their design basis. Sort of into unknown territory, which is frightening to me.</p><div class='title'><b>If they are injecting seawater that means that they are no longer concerned with recovering these reactors.</b> It means that they have fallen back to "protect the public" mode. So far from what I have read, there is very likely fuel melt, but the reactor vessels and the primary containments are still intact. The hydrogen explosions occurred in their secondary containments due to build-up of vented steam/gasses from the primary containments or reactor vessels. Not sure if this is a design difference or due to the deranged equipment, our plant would vent the gas outside of both containments. <b>One thing is for sure, hydrogen almost surely means melted cladding and fuel damage.</b></div><p>Now I hear there is a fire on site and it may be threatening the spent fuel pool of one unit. This worries me more than the other issues right now. Spent fuel on the pool is within the secondary containment, but outside the primary containment. Needless to say it is HIGHLY radioactive. Assuming the primary containments hold at all the facilities, then the fuel pool is much more vulnerable and dangerous.</p><p>Keep in mind, these guys are in new territory here. They may have drilled and trained for these scenarios, but nothing ever goes exactly according to plan. I have much respect for the guys who are there and fighting this beast."</em></p><p><em>"<b>First off this cannot be like Chernobyl as they are very different animals.</b> Chernobyl actively exploded the reactor vessel. Chernobyl had no primary containment (by design), only a secondary containment structure. So when it blew the vessel head off, it and the steam plume blasted the building apart. Chernobyl fuel was open to the sky, no barrier at all between the public and the molten core of the reactor. That is why it spewed millions of curies of radioactive particulate into the sky.</p><p>There is a threat with the spent fuel pools. I don't know how much fuel they have in their pools, if any. If they do it is just as hazardous as what is in the core, with one exception. It is outside the primary containment structure. This makes it a little more worrisome in my opinion. I haven't heard much mention of the spent fuel pools at any of the affected units. I hope that is because everything there is under control. They do not require much cooling, because most of it has been removed from a core for a long time and has had many half-lives to decay away, so there is little decay heat. However, it is still quite radioactive.</p><p>The containment at Daiichi is much different than Chernobyl. Assuming that the fuel melted in all three of the affected reactors then there is still a very robust reactor vessel and a even more robust primary containment structure. Both are designed to be flood-able, and we know that they are filling up with borated seawater. </p><p>The name of the game now is cover and cool. This is what they are doing. I think there will be and has been release of radioactive materials, but so far they are keeping those cards close to the vest. I think in time it will be revealed to be orders of magnitude less than Chernobyl.</p><p>There is some news that Daiichi 2 has had a breach in the reactor vessel. That means that there is in all likelihood some fuel material out of the vessel and in the primary containment structure. Not time to panic yet, just need them to keep cooling that containment."</em></p><p><em>"Worst case...all the threatened containments fail and/or the fuel pools drain/collapse. The amount of radioactive material released is huge and we get an Asian version of Pripyat.</p><p>The reactors are shutdown now and they are getting water into the vessels (borated seawater). So, we are dealing with decay heat and it is not likely there will be a massive explosion a la Chernobyl, but the release could still be huge."</em></p><p>The Wikipedia entry for the Fukushima disaster is being updated constantly.  Here's the article on the timeline of events: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents</a></p><p>That also shows that NISA rates this as a Level 4 nuclear disaster, whereas ASN rates it as Level 6.Â Here's the International Nuclear Event Scale explaining those levels: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale</a></p><p>Also, in you're wondering, they are about 15 nuclear power sites across Japan housing 55 nuclear reactors.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan</a></p><p>Several of the northeastern plants have been shut down automatically from the tremors.  As such, Japan is operating under a huge power loss.  They have dimmed down electricty in Tokyo is conserve as much power as possible.  They have also roaming scheduled blackouts to keep the electrical output needed at a minimum.</p><p>Eva Geeks comments that there's a grassroots movement of nerds to dub these blackouts and brownouts after an event that happens in the Evangelion television show and movies, entitled Operation Yashima.  In the show, Japan consolidates all of the energy output of their nation to fire a cannon against the alien threat. <a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2011/03/operation-yashima-website/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2011/03/operation-yashima-website/">http://www.evageeks.org/2011/03/operation-yashima-website/</a></p><div class='title'><b>Continuing Coverage</b></div><p>As far as news sources, I've been paying attention to reddit and Google News for new information and sifting through it to find the relevant news.</p><p>Google has an amazing map showing the devastation: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ftr=crisisresponse.kmlpanel:src=japan_earthquake_2011&amp;cad=japan_earthquake_2011" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?ftr=crisisresponse.kmlpanel:src=japan_earthquake_2011&amp;cad=japan_earthquake_2011">http://maps.google.com/maps?ftr=crisisresponse.kmlpanel:src=japan_earthquake_2011&amp;cad=japan_earthquake_2011</a></p><p>Also, be sure to <b>Donate</b>!!

Despite the constant protests, the republicans of Wisconsin did not care at all.  "Busting" the unions was their ultimate goal and financial situations played no part in it.</p><p>The people of Wisconsin, and citizens of the Midwest responded by showing up to the Capitol on Saturday to show their disapproval.</p><p>The Saturday rally comprised of 2 events.  Before Noon, the Wisconsin Farmer's Association drove their tractors to the Capitol and circled the square for about an hour in solidarity.  At 2pm, the main rally took place on the State St. side of the Capitol with several musical acts and speakers.</p><p>Jess, Jon and I got up to the Square to check out the tractors, which was more parade-like that protesting.  I don't really have any pictures of that because it was about as interesting as a parade.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1749.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1766.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1772.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1777.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110312_protest/IMG_1779.webp"  /></p><p>After roaming around for a while, we went to lunch.

| March 7, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dead Space Extraction</b></div><p>In 2009, the now Visceral Games produced a Dead Space spinoff named Extraction.  It was a Wii title, and it was an on-rails shooter.  What better direction for the series than to make this moody adventure game into a fast paced action game.  And then to release it on a platform that has the least amount of your fan base.  I'm not really sure why they thought this was a good idea.  And it seems they won't make that mistake again as it horribly tanked in sales.</p><p>Being a fan of Dead Space, I had eventual plans to buy it.  My local Wal*mart always has copies, and I would probably take the plunge once the price point hit $20.  But last year's E3 came with some amazing news.  With the upcoming release of the Playstation Move, Visceral was upscaling the graphics, and including the game FOR FREE with each initial copy of Dead Space 2!</p><p>And thank god it was free.  I finished it the other day, and $20 is still a bit much.  It's a decent on-rails shooter, but the name "Dead Space" brings in some very weighted expectations.  Dead Space is a very solitary experience.  It's a game that crawls into your head and exercises your ears.  Most enemies are taken on a few at a time, and using the environment can lend itself well to taking down swarms of them.</p><p>An on-rails shooter is the exact opposite of that.  Enemies pop up, and you shoot them down.  Hit the weak spot for massive damage.  Bang bang bang!  Also, now it's two player! No longer a solitary experience. And you're always running around in a group of two to five people.</p><p>I am glad I played though it, though.  Story-wise, Dead Space Extraction takes place directly before Dead Space 1.  You play several characters on the surface of Aegis VII (or whatever) when the outbreak occurs.  You find a couple of survivors, escape the surface of the planet to the Ishimura, and then eventually escape the Ishimura.  It sets up a couple things in Dead Space 1, and ends almost right as the next game begins.</p><p>It's fun to see some of the expanded universe of Dead Space, but I don't really find the story all that interesting.  Hurrah, there's a dangerous space object that turns people crazy and into monsters.  It's really just background setup for the game's senario.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 2 Severed</b></div><p>So anyway, most of your characters in Extraction survive past the end, but their stories aren't over.  Last week, Visceral released an $8 expansion for Dead Space 2 entitled Severed, which continues the tale of two characters from Extraction.  They both happen to be on Titan while Isaac is running around killing things.  You play soldier Gabe Weller, as he tries to make it to his Wife, Luxine.</p><p>Severed is actually pretty amazing.  It's tight and short story that brings together all the aspects I love about Dead Space.  As you're running through the mines, separate areas are distinct by the sounds of the loud, nearby machinery.  The environment actually uses your senses to spook you, rather than scare tactics.  And the story actually adds a little depth to the Dead Space universe.</p><p>It's definitely worth playing.</p><div class='title'><b>The Universe</b></div><p>Besides these games, EA has done a whole lot with the Dead Space IP.  There's a couple other games, plus a few movies and books too.  I haven't touched any of that crap.  But, given my investment into the series already, I might consider checking more of this stuff out.</p><p>Dead Space Ignition - PSN Title and prequel to Dead Space 2<br/>Dead Space Downfall - Animated film that takes place in between Extraction and Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Aftermath - Animated film that takes place after Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Comic Book - A Comic Book that takes place before Downfall<br/>Dead Space Martyr - A novel that focuses on the Unitology religion.<br/>Dead Space Salvage - A Comic book that takes place some time between Dead Space 1 and 2.</p><p>I think this shows how poor the story of Dead Space is. All of these spin-offs center around the events in the game itself.  The only real universe building they've done is that novel which centers on the Unitology religion that keep coming back to.  Everything else is basically "and then this happened!" rather than "and this is why it happened."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Protest!

| March 4, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight! Madison's first ever Ramen restaurant has its grand opening to the public.  It's located on 923 Willy Street, and leading up to its grand opening, they've been having a couple "soft" opening dates this week.  Along with Kyle and Skatje, I attended their soft opening last night, and tried a couple of their dishes.</p><p>The crew of Umami converted an old house that had been on the 900 block since the 1880s into their restaurant.  The outside still has the structure and look at the original house.  But inside is very different.  Inside eminates the feeling of a trendy restaurant you'd find in the downtown area of any urban sprawl.  Piano music plays in the background.  Solid colors of maroon, yellow, and white splash the walls.  The entire place is very clean, stoic and prestine, but the colors bring life to it.</p><p>It's actually nothing like a Ramen restaurant at all.  It's what I'd expect some trendy American Sushi place to be like.  The only Ramen restaurants that I've been to in America have been Japanese owned and operated.  They were ethnic through and through.  This place is just a little too good for Ramen.  Ramen is basically junk food.  Delicious, Amazing junk food.  It's designed to give you a shit load of calories FAST so you can return to work full of energy.  (Or a fantastic drunken snack.)  It has the same status symbol as a Hot Dog.  It's not some delicate menu item, like Sushi.</p><p>This just feels...  wrong.  And the menu prices compliment the trendy nature of the place.  They serve 3 types of Ramen at Umami: Vegetable, Miso, and Tonkotsu, which are $10, $10 and $12 respectively.  It's really the most I've ever paid for a single bowl of Ramen in my life.  Mitsuwa's Ramen restaurant charges $8 that comes complete with a bunch of other delicious goodies.</p><p>I tried their Miso Ramen, and was rather underwhelmed.  This wasn't really Miso Ramen.  They used chicken stock rather than an actual miso base.  Also, the noodles tasted undercooked, but they weren't terrible.  If I made Ramen from stratch, this is probably what it would taste like.  Definitely not authentic, but good enough.  Unfortunately, "Good Enough" does not warrant a $10 price tag.  It don't really care if it's authentic, but it should taste just as good.</p><p>In addition, to the Miso Ramen, I had their Vegetable Dumplings, which were pretty good.  I think they were filled with carrots, bamboo shoots, and ginger.  They provided dumpling sauce which reeked of vinegar.  Way too much vinegar :(  For dessert, I had the Green Tea Creme Brulee since I'm a huge fan of Green Tea Ice Cream.  This was actually quite delicious.  (Though, I would have preferred Ice Cream)  Also, their beer is expensive.</p><p>I had being negative about the place.  Ramen is one of my favorite foods on earth.  Unfortunately, I feel like they're trying to capitalize on the trendy nature of Japan, and the void of Ramen representation in Madison.  I would rather my money go toward how the food tastes, rather than how the restaurant looks.</p><p>Hopefully, I'll make it back there sometime this weekend to give it another try.  Especially the Tonkotsu Ramen, which looked like it had the correct ingredients, anyway.</p><p>Check out their website for a history of their renovations to 923 Willy St. <br/><a href="http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/" title="http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/">http://umamiramen.blogspot.com/</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Protest!

The protests have continued to rage throughout the past week, and Walker still refuses to budge.  This week has taken a bit of turn...  On Sunday evening, the Capitol doors have closed and they are no longer allowing any of the public to enter on their own.  They must be accompanied by an officer to their destination inside, and then escourted outside after their business is concluded.</p><p>Around 60 protestors still remain inside the Capitol, allowing cleaning crews to do their jobs, but continuing to peacefully occupy the space which is constitionally theirs to demonstrate upon.   As such, other protestors who have not been able to get inside have been sleeping outside the Capitol doors, demanding their entry to the building.</p><p>Here's a few photos of the King St entrance on Wednesday night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1088.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1088.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1088.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1090_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1090_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1090_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1090_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1090_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1098_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1098_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1098_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1098_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1098_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1111.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110302_protest/IMG_1111.webp"  /></p><p>Throughout Capitol Square, drums are beaten to the rhythm of democracy.  Chants are constant.  It's really the calm before the storm.  With the Capitol closed, and Walker illegal shuttering people out, the protestors plan for the weekend.  And they plan for a massive demonstration Thursday Night as a taste of things to come.</p><div class='title'><b>Day 18</b></div><p>At 5pm, almost 5000 people gathered at the UW-Madison library off State St, and began marching up State St to the Capitol.  State St was completely overwhelmed with protestors.

people.

| March 2, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan over last weekend, and only 26 days until its release in the states.  I have had mine preordered since Nintendo announced the price and release date, and I am super excited.  Not necessarily because of the 3D capabilties, nor any of the games, but mostly as a replacement for my Nintendo DS Lite.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo DS Lite</b></div><p>My Nintendo DS was part of the second release wave of the Nintendo DS Lite in Japan, almost 5 years ago.  I wasn't initially into the DS, mostly because of the aesentics.  It looked like a frampy piece of tech designed around the chipset inside.  There really weren't that many games for it either.</p><p>When they unveiled the sleak and sexy design of the DS Lite, it completely turned around my opinion.  By that time, there were games that were actually worth my time.  Tetris DS, Phoenix Wright, Electroplankton and Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow were the first games I owned for the handheld, and still remain as some of the best game offered for the platform.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, I have played my Nintendo DS so much that the touch screen can no longer be correctly configured.  Games like Trauma Center and Ouendan are unplayable.  It's time for an upgrade.</p><p>Last year, I planned on replacing my DS with one of those DSi XLs.  Unfortunately, Nintendo made an incredibly stupid PR move.  One week before the DSi XL were to be released in the states, they announced the Nintendo 3DS.  The successor to the DS platform.  I was all set to replace my DS with a $190 DSi XL, and they lost my money.  Upgrading to the new platform is a much more lucrative prospect.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo 3DS</b></div><p>And now we're just 26 days away!  While there really aren't any launch titles that interest me, there are several on the horizon I care about: Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D, Professor Layton v. Phoenix Wright, Megaman Legends 3 and the newly announced Super Mario title.  There's also plenty of DSi Ware games that I haven't had a chance to play having never owned a DSi.</p><p>But!  What really interests me are the built games and features of the 3DS.  You can capture 3D photos and film. There are augmented reality games to play.  There's a built in pedometer that unlock rewards.  And there's a thing called <b>Street Pass</b>.</p><p>The Street Pass is a communication sensor that will connect to any other 3DSs you may pass by throughout your day.  It will transfer your Mii to them, and their Mii to you.  Besides building a social gaming web of your daily life, you can use these Miis with two built-in games: a Puzzle game and a Quest game.  For the puzzle game, Each Mii you meet you can exchange jigsaw puzzle pieces, and form some random Nintendo images.  In the Quest game, each Mii will take on monsters in a dungeon until they're scared off.</p><p>Here's a video showing off the Street Pass stuff: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ</a>.</p><p>I would expect conventions and other massive nerd gatherings to be invaluable towards building a huge list of stranger's Miis.  PAX West this year should be fantastic. ^_^</p><p>Anyway, I'm excited.  Though, I'll mostly use the 3DS to play DS titles.  Namely Pokemon.  Now that I'll have two DSs, I can trade Pokemon back and forth between my games willy nilly, and not need to borrow a friend's.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 28, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dead Space 2 is a game of many emotions.  For me, it was a 3 stage process.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 1: Disappointment</b></div><p>Isaac awoke from his bed in a medical lab somewhere and was told to get running!  Oh my, I don't remember these contols being so disorienting.  If you break the display into 3 sections, Isaac is positioned right between the left and middle sections.  Initially, this forces me to think that pushing directly up on the joystick will make Issac turn to the left slightly.  So, I try to compensate by push up and right, which make him run forward to the right.  I compensate by pulling back left, but then he doesn't move as far left I was thinking.  ugh :(</p><p>Also, Isaac was in a straight jacket the whole time, so that might be why it was so disorienting.  After an hour of running around, I was getting rather frustrated, so I put it down and went to bed.  I picked it up the next day with my expectations realigned, and ready to continue the journey.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 2: Delightment</b></div><p>Once I had become one with the controls, Dead Space's wonderful concept of immerson took center stage.  I was no longer controlling Isaac, I WAS Isaac.  Dead Space 2 is right at home with everything I loved about the first game, namely the environment and the sound.</p><div class='title'><b>The Moon!</b></div><p>While going through offices, homes, and stores in this mess of a space station or space ship or whatever, people kept referring to it as "Titan".  I figured it was just the name of the place, until I entered a room with a complete view of the outside.  It was Saturn!  The planet Saturn!  It hung so beautifully in the spacey sky.  And I realized that by "Titan", they meant the MOON!</p><p>In Dead Space 1, they just made up some planet for the Ishimura to crack.  I think it was called Aegis?  Actually, seeing how Aegis is greek, there probably is a moon with that name in our Solar System, but no where near reknowned as Titan.</p><p>The Titan moon base continued with Dead Space's theme of an organic, yet synthetic environment, ala Alien Resurrection.  And it's horrific display of gore and twisted ideals, ala Event Horizon.  Unlike the Ishimura from the first game, the Titan moon base feels much more comfortable.  Much of the environment feels dank because all the lights have been blown out and there's blood everywhere.  Before all hell broke loose, I'm sure much the locations looked a lot like Star Trek, or Mass Effect.  They just needed a fresh coat of blood to tear them down.</p><p>Now that we're running through a sustainable ecosystem, rather than an engineering vessel, there is much more variety.  You find yourself going through residential units, a mall, a church, and an elementary school, before you get to the space station stuff.</p><p>Dead Space doesn't miss the opportunity to go creepy with the elementary school.  There are now baby necromorphs and 5th grader necromorphs.  I think the 5th graders are my favorite enemy in the game.  10 or 15 of them will appear from a doorway and attempt to swarm you, while keeping their distance.</p><p>Rather than shooting them down with my gun, I always go for melee. Â It reminds me a lot of this website: <a href="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/" title="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/">How many five years olds could you take in a fight?</a> The website is purely theoretical, and this was my "real life" chance to find out!  I was able to take down about 6 of 'em, before 3 more jumped on top of me and brought me down.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp">Get these goddamn children off of me!</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Mood</b></div><p>Unfortunately with the amount of variety in the environment itself, sound took second place to art.  While the mood is as immersive as the first game, each area is distinct because of the environment itself, not because it sounds different.  Two of my favorite moments from Dead Space 1 were the engine room, and the first moment you hit space.</p><p>The engine room was massively loud.  The whirring of the engine completely over came my senses, and made progress a bit disorienting.  Even more so when the enemies broke into the room and I had to fight them while the huge, loud engine was right on top of me.  There is nothing like this in Dead Space 2.</p><p>The only parts in Dead Space 2 where the sound takes center stage is Space, which is completely the same as the first game.  There are several points when you are thrust into the vacuum of space to complete your task.  When this happens all sound is sucked out of the environment, and the only thing you hear is yourself.  The beeping on your oxygen tank, your breath as you exhale into your helmet, and the muddled clomps of your foot steps.</p><p>Astronauts describe the feeling of being in space as very isolating.  There is nothing between you and space, but the layer of your space suit.  Dead Space nailed this feeling perfectly, so I'm glad they brought it back for the sequel.  And now you have thrusters to fly through Space!</p><div class='title'><b>Mood Killer</b></div><p>One thing I really hate about Dead Space 2 is the use of scare tactics.  Dead Space 2 does an incredible job of immersing you in the environment and lulling you into an intent state, only to tear everything down by a monster popping out of the wall, or jumping out at you from behind a corner.  It doesn't make the game scary.  Being startled is not being scared. Â By the fourth or fifth time, I just shrug it off and blow them away. There's no sense of danger, or being spooked.</p><p>It's the difference between somewhere coming up from behind you and yelling "BOO", rather than walking through the woods at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 3: Frustration</b></div><p>It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt :(</p><p>Dead Space 2 is quite an enjoyable experience until you get to the final chapters of the game.  All story points converge at the government sector of the moon base.  You've lead all the enemies of the game to this point, so now you need to fight them all.  And you have a new enemy which cannot be killed, only slowed down.</p><p>Throughout the entire game, ammunition and health had never really been a problem.  I have died quite a bit, but it was usually because I did something stupid.  Dead Space would train me not to do that, and point out it should be done this way.  I adapted and continued.  I would always have enough health packs lying around to heal me, and plenty of ammo around to keep me moving through the hordes of enemies.</p><p>In the second to last chapter, Dead Space pretty much gave up on this balance.  The enemies were more difficult, and there were more of them.  I started using a whole lot of ammunition taking them down without enough to return to take on the next wave.  So, I started getting hit more, and using up my health packs.  Wave after wave of enemies continued, and I no longer had health to regen.</p><p>I basically pushed and shoved my way through all the enemies to make progress, which resulted in many many lives, and many many restarts.  Yes, I wasn't really thinking about how I could improve, but with constant failure, I just wanted to get it done.  I finally made it to the final checkout, which was complete with a Store to resupply.</p><p>What awaited behind that checkout was another constant horde of enemies, I had to push through to get to the final boss.  But when I made it, I was all out of ammo and health again.  Basically fucked.  I tried taking them down, but after 30 minutes, I quit.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>With a good night's rest to think about my options, I returned with a plan.  I sold all my extra ammo and focused completely on the only gun I had completely leveled up, my Plasma Cutter.  With my strategy realigned, I tore through the horde, pushing most of them aside to greet the final boss, again.  This time I blasted the shit of them.  They hardly stood a chance.</p><p>Overall, Dead Space 2 did not let me down.  I feel like it had a few incredible scenes and sequences, sewn together by a solid base.  Before I got to the end, I had a very enjoyable time, and I'll probably pick it up again to chew away at the remaining achievements.</p><p>I would totally recommend Dead Space 2 for anyone that has fond memories of the original.</p><p>Also, the legend continues (or begins) with Dead Space Extraction included on the disc!  Plus, there is DLC releasing tomorrow that ties Extraction into Dead Space 2, entitled "Severed".<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/37">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/35">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
