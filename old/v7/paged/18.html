| May 6, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I took part in the Nakagawa Half Marathon <span class='ja'>中川ハーフマラソン</span>, located in a beautiful valley of southern Nagano prefecture <span class='ja'>長野県</span>.  I came across this marathon by browsing through <a href="http://runnet.jp/" title="http://runnet.jp/">runnet.jp</a>, Japan's premiere website for signing up for marathons.  (Very similar to active.com in the states.)  Unlike the Takaoka Marathon, which I've "run" twice now (<a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">Nov 18th, 2013</a>, <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2" title="/takaoka-marathon-2">Jun 18th, 2014</a>), this was much more laid back and treated as a community event, rather than an athletic competition.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" /></p><p>They actually had a marathon expo prior to the event where people could do packet pick-up.  I was unable to make it there the day before, so I went the morning of the marathon.  Packet Pick-up was quite smooth.  With each packet, you could enter a raffle to win several local goods.  I won an apple.</p><p>Inside the packet was a bunch of advertisement, and coupons.  Also included is the marathon "program" which includes a list of ALL participants.  The Takaoka Marathon did this, too.  Looking through the list, I was one of only 3 or 4 foreign participants, out of the entire ~3000 person list.  They gave out 2 bibs, too.  The front one contains the timing chip.  The back one shows which prefecture you've come from.</p><div class='title'><b>Opening Ceremony errata</b></div><p>On the day of the race, the expo was open from 7:00am to 8:20am.  At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" /></p><p>This lasted 40 minutes. :/  The speakers didn't take all that long, but the special guests absorbed a ton of time.  Musical guest: Parallel Dream came to cheer us on.  This is an idol group from Nagano.  And M<span class='ja'>高史</span> (Takashi), which is apparently some kind of famous runner, or a comedian, or both? I dunno.</p><p>They entertained the crowd, and then everyone did the morning exercise routine.  I left and wandered around.</p><p>The race finally began at 9:30am.  I really miss the 7:00am start times in America.</p><div class='title'><b>The Course</b></div><p>M<span class='ja'>高史</span> fired the starting pistol, and then started giving everyone high-fives as they ran passed him.  It was SO congested, I don't think I started actually running until 1km in.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" /></p><p>For the first 3.5km, it was completely uphill.  We started at 470m above sea level, and kept climbing and climbing.  At 3.5km, we reached the highest point in the marathon, 620m.</p><p>The view along the way was great.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going downhill is so much easier.  Gravity does most of the work. :)  But, it was still too congested to actually glide down the hill.  And now we were running against the people behind us still climbing the hill.</p><p>Just past the 4km mark, the last person went by, and road width essentially doubled.  I launched myself into the other lane, and somewhat leapt down the hill.

The roads weren't completely shut down, so some cars would drive by, and try to make it through the packs of people.</p><p>Around the 8km, the "bottom" of the course became visible.  The lowest point of 420m, which were flat farm plots.  You were able to see almost everyone in front of you, and the direction of the course.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When running marathons, I really prefer to think about the course one mile, or one kilometer at a time.  I like knowing which mile or kilometer I'm running, but being able to see the entire course is just too much to take in.  "I need to run all of that?!"  And there are so many people in front of me.  Bleh…</p><p>On top of that, the course zig-zags around the rice fields, rather than going in a straight line.  It's somewhat demoralizing when a course doesn't take the most efficient route.  It feels like I'm wasting time, rather than getting to the finish as fast as I can.</p><p>It's quite beautiful, though. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last leg of the course was an uphill climb to the finish line.  At this point, it was nice to look back and see the course, and remind myself just how far I've traveled.  Seeing the course here is way more rewarding rather than seeing it near the middle of the run.</p><p>Only a short kilometer or two remaining, until crossing the finish line.  After crossing the finish line, they drape you in a large tower with the marathon's logo on it.  Really nice.  My time was 2 hours 40 minutes 13 seconds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not bad. :)  I did a bit better than I thought I would.  Continuing back to the expo hall, you could take some bottled water, fruit, and other post-race food.  Like an actual marathon back in the states!</p><p>Overall, I really liked this race.  It went through some beautiful scenery, and with the 3 hour limit, there were many more casual racers, rather than a legion of athletes.  The race was nice and casual, and was very fun.  This race was the most like any marathon I've done back in the states.  Very positive, and fun.</p><p>I'll definitely do this again next time.</p><p><u>Update (June 25th):</u>  Man.. I have been 100% sick since doing this race.  I've been coughing every day, and my lungs are constantly full of flem.  Ech.  I most've inhaled pollen or dust or something airborne during this race that has ruined my lungs. :(<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Tanake 高根村" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane">Revisiting Tanake 高根村</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Takane is one of Takayama's eastern-most neighborhoods. Back in the day, all of the pockets of modern day Takayama had thriving neighborhoods in the middle of nowhere. The people there worked in mines or with logging companies. </p><p>Because of their remoteness, these neighborhoods had their own elementary and junior high schools. During winter, there was so much snow that the roads became difficult and dangerous to drive. However, over time, people who grew up in these neighborhoods moved closer to Takayama proper for jobs. Mining and Logging jobs went away. Few young people remained. Also, with modern snow plows and busses (and also with climate change) traveling on those mountain roads were no longer that difficult.</p><p>Both Takane Junior High and Elementary closed, and any students living in Takane now had a bus to bring them to the next nearest school.</p><p>I visited Takane <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">last year</a> and peered around the old schools which were still there. Even though the schools closed, they were reused at community centers for cooking classes and other community classes. Now, one year later, the elementary school still stood, but the junior high has been completely demolished.</p><p>Below are the photos.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ikegaharashitsugen 池ヶ原湿原" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ikegaharashitsugen">Ikegaharashitsugen 池ヶ原湿原</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Unfortunately, it was missing one important thing that I really love about modern cars:  a direct AUX input for the car stereo.

I was super hungover from drinking with teachers and parents the previous night, but it was too perfect a day to waste sleeping.  A perfect day such as this requires a trip to the Shinhotaka Ropeway.  On such a nice day, you can see everything the view has to offer.</p><p>Shinhotaka <span class='ja'>新穂高</span> refers to the base area in Takayama underneath a collection of mountains known as Mount Hotaka <span class='ja'>穂高岳</span>.  These mountains rest in northeastern Takayama bordering Nagano prefecture, and are some of the tallest mountains not only in Gifu, but all of Japan.  The major peaks of Hotaka are Okuhotaka <span class='ja'>奥穂高</span>, Karasawa <span class='ja'>涸沢</span>, Kitahotaka <span class='ja'>北穂高</span>, Maehotaka <span class='ja'>前穂高</span>, and Nishihotaka <span class='ja'>西穂高</span>.  <a href="/old/v7/norikura-snow" title="/norikura-snow">Mount Norikura</a> <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> is not part of the range, by the way.  That is a separate mountain directly south from the Hotaka Range.  Though the Hotaka Range is mostly obscured from view in downtown Takayama, I do have a clear view of these mountains everyday from my junior high school in <a href="/old/v7/december-snow-2" title="/december-snow-2">Kiyomi</a>.</p><p>I rolled out of bed around 10:30am, climbed into my car, and drove the 70 minutes to the ropeway station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Shinhotaka Ropeway is a gondola ride that brings you to a station 2155 meters in the sky.  It rests on a plateau on the side of Mount Nishihotakadake <span class='ja'>西穂高岳</span>, which has an altitude of 2909 meters.  </p><div class='title'><b>Shinhotaka Ropeway - Lower Station</b></div><p>There are two stations at the bottom of the mountain, and another gondola ride between them.  I parked at the lower station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The above photo shows a counterweight passing by.  This is used to balance the weight from the other car carrying passengers.  The lower ropeway used to have two cars running on its ropeway, but on January 19th, they had an accident.  One of the cars (carrying 8 people at the time) was swaying back and forth and smashed into one of the support structures.  One woman was injured, but not seriously.</p><p>On January 31st, only the second ropeway had reopened, and not until last week, March 20th, had full service resumed operation.  The cause is not fully known yet, but I think they're simply blaming it on the heavy winds from that day.  Here's an article about it: <a href="http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2015031690200848.html" title="http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2015031690200848.html">click!</a>.</p><p>Inside the station, I bought my ticket, and waited for my ride.

This made some people gasp, and look around nervously.  Of course, it was not windy in the slightest this day.  Only a breeze.</p><div class='title'><b>Shinhotaka Ropeway - Second Station</b></div><p>From the second station, the gondola cars are much bigger, much bulkier, and much safer, too.

These were the only schools I noticed, and due to the size of these schools, I'm assuming these were made in their art clubs.</p><p>As the next gondola arrived, I boarded it, and descended back down to my car.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5637.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5637_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5637_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5637_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Wasabi Ice Cream</b></div><p>Located in the lower ropeway station is a small cafe with some noodles, and other small treats.  If you ever have the chance to come to the Shinhotaka Ropeway, you ABSOLUTELY must try the wasabi ice cream, which is rather unique to the ropeway.  I haven't seen this flavor available anywhere else.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are two very strong flavors that are completely opposite.  There's the sweet, cold delicious taste of the ice cream.  And there's the hot, spicy, sometimes incapacitating flavor of wasabi.  I think some people avoid wasabi as much as possible because it's so potent.  I think that wasabi ice cream is a rare chance where the spiciness is so overpowered by the ice cream, you can actually taste wasabi for its distinct flavor, rather than its hot spicy texture.</p><p>Initially, you are hit by the sweetness of the ice cream.  For the first few seconds, it just tastes like normal ice cream.  But as the taste lingers in your mouth, and spice of wasabi starts to set and grow.  It's not hot, or overpowering.  It's just the flavor.</p><p>It's so good.  It's really the absolute softest safest approach to consuming wasabi.  All wasabi and almost none of the spice.</p><div class='title'><b>Foot Bath</b></div><p>One of my favorite places is on the way back to central Takayama.  Just west of Tochio <span class='ja'>栃尾</span>, is <span class='ja'>火山の恵</span> <span class='ja'>広場</span>, which apparently translates as the Volcano Wisdom Plaza.  Here you can pay 100<span class='ja'>円</span> ($1), and soak your tired feet for the recommended 30 minutes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hot, scalding, therapeutic waters burn away dead skin cells and excite the muscles.  After, your skin is left clean of death, and very smooth.  Several times, I exited the bath, and walked in the snow to flash fry and freeze my feet.  It didn't completely work.  Also, the bath really wasn't all that hot on this day.  Maybe I'm getting used to scalding water on my feet, though.</p><p>Sitting down, and burning away your feet would be a nice relaxing end to a day of hiking.  But for me, it was simply the end of a day riding a gondola.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hina Matsuri ひな祭り in Hida no Sato 飛騨の里" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato">Hina Matsuri ひな祭り in Hida no Sato 飛騨の里</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

That's not really the case in Hida.  Not only is there still snow on the ground, but it still continues to snow!  It just snowed today, too.  As such we have our own regional "girl's" festival celebrating Hina Matsuri and the arrival of Spring called Ikibina Matsuri.

| March 12, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For my final 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> and 6<span class='ja'>年生</span> classes of the year, we played <b>Four Square</b>.  This was a game my friends and I played quite a bit back in elementary school, so I thought it would be fun to teach students this game, and see what they thought.  I'm pretty sure it's still played today in American elementary schools.</p><div class='title'><b>Initial Plans</b></div><p>Originally, I wanted to do something else this year, since I had done Four Square <a href="/old/v7/lessons-h25-special-four-square" title="/lessons-h25-special-four-square">last year</a>.  But scheduling classes at the end of the year is difficult as graduation practice is very important and takes over much of the schedule.  In order to have a final game for a class, I would have to teach all 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> together at one of my schools.</p><p>Whatever.  I pulled out my Four Square plan from last year, and suggested we could do this in the gym with everyone together.  We found a free period for the gym, and scheduled the 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> class for that time, then scheduled all my other classes around that.</p><p>And yesterday, we played!</p><div class='title'><b>Set Up</b></div><p>Last year, I made only 2 four square courts.  I had 80 students, and was able to teach each class at a time.  Everyone had a great time, but with 20 kids per court, many kids were bored on the side lines waiting to get into the game.  They didn't pay attention half the time, and just sat with their friends doing whatever.</p><p>Given the space we had in the full gym, and all 70 students this year together, we were able to make 6 courts.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4693.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4693.webp" /></p><p>The night before we were to play Four Square, I went to school.  The 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> teachers and I laid down the tape to create 6 courts.  As you can see above, we cheated a little bit and used some existing lines.</p><p>Each court is 5 meters by 5 meters, and then divided down the middle at the 250 cm mark.  Since we cheated, these courts were actually 470 cm in "diameter".  Whatever, close enough.</p><p>I bought this tape at my local Daiso <span class='ja'>ダイソ</span>, which is a chain of 100<span class='ja'>円</span> stores.  Each roll of tape had 16m.  2 rolls were required to make one complete court.  So, I bought 12 rolls to cover the 6 courts we had planned.  Since we used those existing lines, we only used 6 rolls.  Plus I had some left over from last year, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4692.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4692.webp" /></p><p>We also laid out the tape for the numbers.  Number 1 and 4 must be opposed, but other than that, the layout of the numbers doesn't matter at all.  And really, that 1-4 rule is considered more of a "house rule" anyway.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's Play!</b></div><p>I had already thoroughly explained the rules to my teachers, so they already knew how to play.  We even played a few practice rounds together after making the courts so everyone fully understood the rules.</p><p>During class, I explained the rules in English, and they would translate for the students that couldn't understand.  Eventually the teachers took over the explanation since we had to stop every minute to tell the kids the shut up.</p><p>It took a little while to explain all the rules but many of the students understood.  We got 5 students as volunteers, and had them play a mock game to further demonstrate the rules for the students.  Then they were off!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The teachers and I each went to a court to referee some students and get them started.  We explained that if you are waiting in line, you must referee the game, too.</p><p>Everything went AMAZING.  So smooth.  Way smoother than last year.  Last year, there was at least one student in all my classes left crying.  Other students got really pissed off when they lost.  There was none of that this year.  All the 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> were very sportsmanlike in their defeat, and victories.</p><p>Having the extra courts really kept the students moving and into the game.  Also, any fight or contested result was simply met with a do-over.  <span class='ja'>もう一回</span>!  We weren't keeping score, so there were no real stakes.  5 or 6 games of waiting in line, and you were back into it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp"/></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>For the first 10 minutes, we made everyone stick to their teams.  For the remaining 6 or 7 minutes, when they lost, they would advance to the next team, and continue cycling around to different teams.  That way they could start playing with other kids, rather than being stuck with their team.</p><div class='title'><b>Success!</b></div><p>As mentioned before, the students loved every minute of running around, and smashing balls into the floor.  Some students immediately understood strategies of hitting the ball near the opponent's feet.  Many students had no reservations of diving for the ball, and lightly knocking it into their opponent's squares.  Others were quickly dodging balls headed out of bounds.</p><p>Despite having many annoying kids with attention problems, and constantly having to shush and yell at them in class, they paid enough attention to understand the rules.  And even if they didn't, the other kids put them in line when they made mistakes.</p><p>At the end, I connected this back in class by mentioning that I played this game when I was an elementary student.  And that it's still played today by many elementary students in America.  So, <b>culture</b> is my excuse for this one.  </p><p>Also, I made them remember the name of the game since it's vocabulary they should know.</p><div class='title'><b>Clean Up</b></div><p>After class had finished, all the students ran around and helped me tear down the courts.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4697.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4697.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4697.webp"/></a></p><p>Awww, that was nice of them.  But then, they started making tape balls, and throwing them at each other, and being annoying again.</p><p>It was a good day, though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Writing Lesson Plans" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/writing-lesson-plans">Writing Lesson Plans</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Currently, I am an ALT teaching English in Takayama, Gifu, Japan.  I teach at both junior high and elementary levels.  My role in junior high is more of an assistant to the full-fledged English teachers at school.  But my role in elementary schools is much more autonomous.  I teach English with the home room teacher, HRT, and the HRTs are usually not English teachers.  They tend to leave all the planning, preparation, and execution of the class to me, the ALT.</p><p>For planning and preparation, and for every class I've ever done, I've written a lesson plan.  A lesson plan is exactly what it sounds like.  It's a (somewhat) detailed account of everything I plan to do for the lesson, including how long things might take, and what materials are required.  It's essentially a recipe.</p><p>In the next year, I plan on changing how I write my lesson plans, and how I conduct class.  This post is the story of my past, present, and future of writing lesson plans.  It's where I've been, where I am, and where I intend to do in the next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I've been</b></div><p>This is where I've been.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4614_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is a collection of every lesson plan, and worksheet I've written over the last two years.  Both fifth and sixth grade have one hour of English of each week.  There are 43 weeks in a school year, but only 35 are required for English.  I teach the other lower grades about once a month.</p><p>Here are two example lesson plans.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-self-intro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-self-intro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-self-intro.webp" /></a></div></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-lesson-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-lesson-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h26-fifth-lesson-1.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These are my first two classes for fifth grade 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> for the 2014 school year.  The first class is my self-introduction.  The second class begins the material from Hi Friends 1, the official text book for the course.</p><div class='title'><b>Flow</b></div><p>Almost all of my lesson plans follow the common "Engage -> Study -> Activate" pattern.  I learned this from that online TEFL course I attended two years ago.  The <b>engage</b> phase essentially warms up the students.  It gets them thinking about the subject and recalling knowledge they already know.  The <b>study</b> phase introduces new content to the students.  The <b>activate</b> phase gives the students a chance to use this knowledge for themselves.</p><p>My self-introduction lesson doesn't follow this pattern exactly, but my plan for Lesson 1 does.  For all my lesson plans, my review section is the engage phase.  "Today's Aim" is the study phase.  And "Activity" is the activate phase.</p><p>The review phase is essentially a tool box.  I'm making a list of everything a student needs to continue the lesson, and putting those contents on the black board.  Even if a student was absent, or totally forgot the previous class, everything they need to know to continue is presented to them at the top of class, and put into view.</p><p>Then, continuing the lesson, I add something new.  A new tool for the tool box, if we continue this analogy.  I give them the tool, explain it to them, teach them how to use it, and then we practice.</p><p>At the end of every lesson is the activity.  The activity makes use of the new tool, and uses the other tools as well.  This gives students a chance to use what they've learned for themselves, and understand it better.</p><p>In class, I'm very upfront about what we plan on doing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the top of class, I place cards on the black board detailing the outline of my lesson plan.  Sometimes I go into detail upfront, but only if it's something irregular, or new.</p><div class='title'><b>Collaboration</b></div><p>Prior to every class, I meet with the home room teacher, give them a copy of the lesson plan, and discuss the contents.  And I usually do this several days in advance.  I rotate around to 3 separate elementary schools, and before I leave one elementary school for a day, I will meet with all the teachers for classes I have on my next visit.  So when I'm done for the day, everything is set up for the next time I'm there.</p><p>During our meeting, I will make it clear if there's anything I need the home room teacher to do, or prepare in advance in order to make class go as smooth as possible.  Also, we can iron out any problems that might occur with my plan, or address any problems specific students might have in class.</p><p>Explaining everything is great for both of us.  I can hear myself talk and essentially practice explaining things the way I will in class.  Hell, if I can't explain my games to the students, there's no way the students will understand.  And if the students don't quite understand me, the teacher knows what is going on, and can make things clear for the students.</p><div class='title'><b>Ideas</b></div><p>I should quickly mention where I actually come up with my ideas for lessons.  The crux of every ALT is coming up with appropriate and effective games and activities for students to use what they've learned.  ALTs use a variety of resources to come up with these ideas.</p><p>I rarely actually come up with a completely new original idea that really works in class.  Sometimes it happens, but more often it's a variation of something else.</p><p>All of my best ideas have come from other ALTs and teachers.  Other ideas have come from the recommended lesson plans, the Gifu published lesson plans, predecessor's lesson plans, Englipedia, and that Team Teaching Pizza book.  I actually use the text book on occasion, too.</p><p>All the ideas that I use (or steal) are ones that I can visualize myself doing in class.  If there's something amazing game out there, but I can't actually see how it fits into my teaching style or plans, then I'm not going to use it.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning Ahead</b></div><p>After writing my first few plans, it became VERY clear that I needed to plan further ahead than just the next week.  I needed to organize all the goals for a lesson, and put them in a clear and logical order that makes sense.  Otherwise, I was forgetting some parts of the lesson, or introducing them too late, or not fully understanding the point of the lesson.</p><p>I started writing a syllabus for the whole lesson and quickly wrote down the review, aim, and activities for each class.  I should've added one here as an example, but it was basically just a straightforward, topdown list.  This really helped me visualized the end, which helped make the journey more successful, and content rich.</p><p>I began giving these to my teachers whenever we began a new lesson in the book so they could see the end, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Evaluation and Keeping a Journal</b></div><p>After every lesson, and every day at school, I record the results of my lesson plans in my schedule book.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4609_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I write about the good and the bad.  I write about events that happen at school, and whether or not the students were more annoying than usual.  I also write about events that happen on the weekend, like results of Kendo tournaments, or information from conferences.  Usually things I don't write blog posts about.</p><p>I feels good to have a handwritten account of my daily life, even though most of this information is recorded elsewhere.  It's all in one place in this book, and easy to reference.</p><p>It's really good for evaluation.  It also proves to the other teachers how much you think about the quality of your lessons, and how you might improve them.  Many teachers have done the whole <span class='ja'>すごい</span> thing after taking a look.</p><p>Beyond that, it's a great keepsake for the future after I'm done here.  I can look back and recall daily events I had forgotten. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Homework</b></div><p>As I've gotten more and more confident teaching in classrooms, and thinking more and more about what I can do for the students to learn better, I began introducing homework into my class.</p><p>The focus of teaching English in elementary school is communication.  We are to get the students to talk, to learn some things, and to get super comfortable with the idea of the language before shoving it down their throats in junior high school.  English in elementary school is not graded in any official manor.  Teachers obviously make notes about the students, and talk to them about participation, but it doesn't really matter.</p><p>But with the focus on communication, listening and speaking, elementary education is missing out on half of what makes up a language: reading and writing.  ALTs aren't supposed to teach it, blah blah blah, but it's still very important.  </p><p>Well, I teach that to the students outside of class in the form of homework.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4587_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I give students these vocabulary sheets at the start of each lesson after I've introduced all the new words.  Then at home, they can practice writing out the words.  They can practice reading them, too.  If they've completed the homework, then I reward them with a sticker. :)</p><p>Homework extends my reach as a teacher outside of class.  Students can continue the lesson, and continue to learn and practice the contents.  Also, my homework tends to list out of the contents of the lesson, so students have a clear account of what's expected of them.  The text book does not do this at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I am</b></div><p>This is what I've been doing for the past year and a half.</p><p>As the <span class='ja'>平成</span>26 school year comes to a close, for the first time, I have a full picture of an entire school year from start to finish.  I can start thinking about how other lessons in the book relate to each other.  And I can think about how I can further build that tool box throughout the entire year, rather than just a lesson at a time.  And how I can write lessons that keep students coming back to their tool box.</p><p>But before that, there is a fundamental problem with my current lesson plans.  </p><div class='title'><b>Actual Collaboration?</b></div><p>Elementary school English is meant to be team taught by the home room teacher and ALT.  I've been running the show the entire time, and not giving the teacher a chance to teach, or even learn themselves.  Usually they relegate themselves to the side or back of the room, and watch the class along with the students.  They tend to keep the peace, and help out students, too, but it's a very secondary role in class.</p><p>This is bad because if and when I leave a school, I will leave a massive hole.  New ALTs are completely inexperienced in almost all aspects of teaching.  I was an absolutely wreck in the beginning.  Current teachers won't necessarily know how to continue my lessons because I'm doing everything myself.  New ALTs won't know what to do, either, and teachers will have a difficult time keeping class together at first.</p><p>My teaching style needs to teach the teachers, too.  I need to give them confidence to teach English just as much as I do.  I need to start focusing on team teaching, and for the next year I'm rewriting my lesson plans to do exactly that.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I'm going</b></div><p>Here are my new lesson plans for <span class='ja'>平成</span>27, 2015.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/IMG_4603_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYTRVNW90eDJXdFk/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYTRVNW90eDJXdFk/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-self-intro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-self-intro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-self-intro.webp" /></a></div></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MMnkxaEJERzlhOFU/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MMnkxaEJERzlhOFU/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-lesson-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-lesson-1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-lesson-1.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These are the exact same lessons from earlier, but with the addition of 3 more columns.</p><p>There's an ALT column, and an HRT column.  These two columns detail exactly what our responsibilities will be during class, and how we can work together.  The ＊ depicts the lead for each section.</p><div class='title'><b>Goals</b></div><p>There's also a goal and purpose column which was sorely missed from my previous plans.  This is actually something required for writing lesson plans that I had never included before.  For each part of the lesson, I'm essentially justifying why I'm doing it, and what I expect the students to get out of it.  </p><p>This is a massive boon as it helps the HRT understand why I'm doing what I'm doing.  Additionally, when writing the plan, it helps me think of more meaningful contents for the lesson, and allows me to get rid of useless, time wasting components.</p><p>Obviously flow is still important.  Lessons can't all be meat.  There still needs to be some fluff to give the meat more meaning.  But this column simply states that everything is in here for a reason.  No bullshit.</p><p>This is all personified in the middle of the document with the Aim.  The Aim is a catch-phrase for the goal of the lesson, which is further detailed underneath.  I plan on writing out the aim on the board for each lesson.  Hopefully this will give more clarity to the students about what is going on in class.</p><div class='title'><b>Syllabus</b></div><p>I've also rewritten my syllabus.  Now that I've been through an entire school year, and can look back, I tried to write something that shows the relationships between each lesson as they go forward.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MV2ZNdU9tZHBsTWs/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MV2ZNdU9tZHBsTWs/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-syllabus.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-syllabus.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150309_lessons/h27-fifth-syllabus.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Each column is a micro version of each lesson that includes the bullet points, and the contents I intend to teach.  If those contents are used in the next lesson, I try to show that relationship.  This is amazing for teachers to understand where things are going, and how to get there.</p><p>Also, they can see everything I plan on teaching for the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>Website - Backend</b></div><p>All of my lesson plans and materials are already hosted on this website, but now I'm making that more apparent by including a URL at the bottom of every plan.  If teachers are missing an old plan, they can easily retrieve the file.</p><p>If some ALT in the future finds a single plan and wants to know more, they can do so.  I've rewritten my entire ALT materials page to be more front facing, and easily to get at the actual files.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="/old/v7/lessons" title="/lessons">theschlock.com/lessons</a>!</p><p>Along with the plans and materials, I have a blog post attached writing out all of thoughts about why I did what I did, what went into making the materials, and how each class actually went.  The good, the bad.  The surprises, the boredom.  And the results.  Plenty of pictures, too. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Successor</b></div><p>Through writing plans in this way, and pointing them back to my website, hopefully I can more properly educate my incoming successor when I leave.  Hopefully they can understand the flow of class, and how to manage it, and the amount of work needed to make their classes effective.</p><p>At the end of the <span class='ja'>平成</span>27 school year, I'll have an entire book created and ready to hand off.</p><div class='title'><b>Homework</b></div><p>As I've continued to get more confident giving out homework, there's really no reason I shouldn't do this more often.  If we're doing an interview in class, I think it's a great idea to give the students an extra sheet, and have them interview their parents, other family members, or teachers.  Using their newly learned language outside of class should really be the goal from the start.</p><p>These sheets can have more writing practice, too.  They can actually practice writing sentences, and use the grammar in a written way.</p><div class='title'><b>Time Investment</b></div><p>All of this does take some time to complete.  My <span class='ja'>平成</span>26 plans can take up to 20 or 30 minutes to write.  Though, I've been able to bang them out in 10 minutes if I know exactly what I plan to do.</p><p>For <span class='ja'>平成</span>27, I've only written those 2 plans thus far.  The first one took about an hour and a half, but I was also experimenting and organizing the format of the document, too.  I wrote the second plan as more of a proof of concept for my layout.  That one took 40 minutes.</p><p>With the increased detail and thought, I expect each of these new plans to take more than twice as long to create.</p><div class='title'><b>Legitimacy</b></div><p>But I think the benefits FAR outweigh any discomfort of having to actually do the job.  Writing lesson plans in this way makes you look incredibly professional.  You like an actual legitimate teacher, and the other teachers start treating you that way too, rather than some gaijin clown hired only to entertain the kids.</p><p>And the pattern is cyclical.  You begin to feel more confident in your job.  You feel like a legitimate teacher, and that your presence in these school is actual valid, and justified.  You feel proud of your work.</p><p>I certainly feel proud of this work.</p><div class='title'><b>Back to the Present</b></div><p>We have two weeks left in this school year, and then everything begins again.  I think the school year starts on April 6th, or 7th, or something.</p><p>Currently, I'm quite far behind with putting my lesson plans on the site.  I plan on catching up with that over Spring Break.  And there's a few more updates I plan on making to the lesson pages, too.</p><p>Hopefully everyone finds something useful out of these plans, and can further improve their teaching because of it. Obviously using someone else's plans is almost impossible.  So much of myself, my teaching style, and my thought process are put into these plans.  Every teacher has a different style, different personality, and a different way of things that work for them.</p><p>I wouldn't suggest someone use these plans directly, but if you find something interesting or useful, write those ideas into your own plans.  It doesn't take much work to write your own, in your own voice, with your teaching style in mind.</p><p>Or, hell, use the plans directly if you want. :)  You know you.  Good Luck.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to バッジとれ〜るセンター" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/3ds-badge-capturing-center">バッジとれ〜るセンター</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Though, <span class='ja'>とれる</span> could be "catch", "take", or "collect".  It basically refers the action in a UFO machine, or crane game when you get something.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSPhE3zckZcQ.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSPhE3zckZcQ.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSPhE3zckZcQ.webp" /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSyUoB84lBR2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSyUoB84lBR2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSyUoB84lBR2.webp" /></p><p>Badge Center is free on the eShop in Japan.  It was just recently released, too!  It came out on December 17th, 2014.  Here's the website: <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/eshop/jwvj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/eshop/jwvj/index.html">http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/eshop/jwvj/index.html</a>  </p><p>In this game, you control a UFO machine and get a bunch of badges.  These badges can be placed on your home screen, and it turn it into something amazing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" /></p><p>This is my current home screen.  I have my game cart on the left.  Street Pass, Badge Center, and my current Picross game on the right.  And then that folder with the rest of my games.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin</b></div><p>When you start up the game, you're greeted by that shifty rabbit who sold you those Street Pass games, and he rolls you through the process.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" /></p><p>Ya know, now that I actually look at this photo, he ends his sentences with <span class='ja'>っす</span> for no real reason.  It seems like Japanese characters tend to do this a lot.  Not necessarily <span class='ja'>っす</span>, but some kind of sentence suffix.  I think it's intended to make the character sound cute.  I guess…</p><p>After his spiel, you are presented with a couple different machines.  There's the practice machine <span class='ja'>本当りつき</span>！<span class='ja'>練習キャッチャー</span>, badge catcher <span class='ja'>バッジキャッチャー</span>, Miiverse, theme shop <span class='ja'>テームショップ</span>, and information <span class='ja'>インフォメーション</span>.</p><p>What you want, what everyone wants, is the badge catcher.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS5V8RbIQ4sP.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS5V8RbIQ4sP.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS5V8RbIQ4sP.webp" /></p><p>Inside this option, you can switch around between several different machine with badges.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSl6wrgbkcoO.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSl6wrgbkcoO.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSl6wrgbkcoO.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSqH8YdhD93K.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSqH8YdhD93K.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSqH8YdhD93K.webp" /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSXNg55bZwQO.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSXNg55bZwQO.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSXNg55bZwQO.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSe0UhjxCNqq.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSe0UhjxCNqq.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSe0UhjxCNqq.webp" /></p><p>There's the typical UFO catching style using the crane.  Those Famicom badges use that style.  For those underground Mario badges, those games use the hammer.  The hammer is something new they introduced in the past two weeks.  And it does just what you'd expect.  The hammer lowers they smacks whatever is underneath, sends badges flying, and then several of the badges fall down and are caught.</p><p>But HERE is perhaps the problem..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" /></p><p>In order to play this game, you must give them money.  5 plays for 90<span class='ja'>円</span> (90 cents).  You can change those options to 10 for 180<span class='ja'>円</span>, or 15 for 270<span class='ja'>円</span>, but there are no deals.  This is why I hesitated to play this game in the first place.  You can receive free plays, though.  </p><p>Every day, you have access to the practice machine one time.  You get 5 plays on the practice machine.  When you catch badges in this machine, they build towards a counter.  Every 10 catches will get you 3 free plays on the regular machines.  Every time you catch the hidden targeted badge, you get 3 free plays on the regular machines.</p><p>5 plays is a pretty good number, though.  I've been able to completely clear machines (at least with the hammer) in 3 to 6 plays.  In one case, I was able to clear a whole screen in one try.</p><div class='title'><b>Rotation</b></div><p>The contents of these UFO machines change every single day.  If you take a look at those Famicom pics again, <span class='ja'>今日で終了</span> means "ends today."  Tomorrow, there will be different badges in their place.  Those Famicom games weren't there yesterday either.  Yesterday, they introduced a bunch of Tomodachi Life items.  The day before that, they had Majora's Mask items.</p><p>From what I can tell, there have been the following series of items: Animal Crossing, Tomodachi Life, Famicom, Mario Kart 8, Zelda Majora's Mask, Zelda Link Between Words, Rhythm Heaven, 8-bit Mario, and regular Mario.  Those 8-bit Super Mario Bros sprites have a whole lot of variations.  Currently there are underground sprites, but there's been overworld ones, clouds, castle, Christmas, and some business suit ones, too.  Actually, right now they have some limited Animal Crossing badges for Hina Matsuri, which is a national holiday in Japan (March 3rd).</p><div class='title'><b>Themes</b></div><p>Additionally, if you spend at least 180<span class='ja'>円</span> in a single day, you get a free theme for your home screen.  All of these themes fit a category of badge.  I spent the money, and got that Mario underground theme, so I can closely recreate a Mario level.  These rotate, too.  Today, there was a Mario Kart 8 theme.</p><p>There are also badges which replace the standard 3DS apps (like the eShop, Street Pass, etc) so your home screen can still have a lot of functionality.  I've only been playing this game since Thursday, so I haven't gotten those yet.</p><div class='title'><b>Ornamental Goods</b></div><p>The idea of selling ornamental goods is not a new thing.  But it has never felt right.  It has always felt shady.</p><p>For the 3DS, this began last year with the sale of themes.  You would spend $1 or $2, and it would change the image and colors of things on your home screen.  There were free themes, too, but those were just solid colors.</p><p>When I originally found out about this game, I thought it was just a new level of this nonsense.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" /></p><p>This is what my screen looks like before.  Super clean, everything accessible.  My American 3DS home screen looks similar.  If I got a couple of badges in the game, where would I put them?  What would I do?  My home screen would be littered with a bunch of non-function garbage that didn't really fit at all.</p><p>Then I got this Club Nintendo theme which looked really nice.  It was 20 points through Club Nintendo. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" /></p><p>It changed the folders to Famicom carts, and made 8-bit sounds when you navigated the menu.  It was nice, and I figured those Famicom badges would actually fit with theme, and perhaps look good.</p><p>I downloaded the game, and went through the tutorial.  The first 17 or 20 minutes of this game is on Youtube, by the way.  That video shows you exactly what you're getting into.</p><p>Again, I started playing this game on Thursday.  And on Thursday, those Famicom badge weren't available in the rotation.  Bah, annoying.  I played the practice machine, and got some free plays.  With those plays, I got my first underground Mario badges.  Then, through the hammer tutorial, I got some more Mario badges.</p><p>Why not?  I dumped in 90<span class='ja'>円</span>, played again, and got a ton more badges.  Then I did it again so I could get the free theme.  And I got plenty more badges, too.  Enough to create that underground scene from earlier.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" /></p><p>The "free" themes are what really make the badges come alive.

For example, each one of those coins are an individual badge I've captured in the game.  You do not have infinite stock.  Though, apparently once you've gotten 100 of a single badge, the counter turns to a star.  Maybe then it's infinite.</p><p>To place badges on the screen, click the settings in the corner.  The badge menu shows up directly under the theme menu.  From there, you pull badges from your menu, and place them on your home screen.  Also, "opening" a badge on the home screen always brings up the badge menu.</p><div class='title'><b>Bleh</b></div><p>My home screen looks pretty awesome, but I feel like all this is taking advantage of that part in my brain that just can't say No to collecting crap.  And now, I want to get more Mario sprites and build more levels within folders.  I would LOVE to get some Zelda sprites, too, and some other 8-bit games.  Maybe some Pokemon badges...  Ugh stop!</p><p>Man, I don't like this.  It's a bunch of 3DS "hats"!</p><p>Showing off your home screen to other people is about the extent of the worth.  But that continues the cycle of making it viral.</p><p>I don't think they've made any announcement about this game coming to the US (or other territories), but the user base in Japan has surpassed 1 million unique users.  I wonder how much money they've made from this.  If each person spent $1, they've made a million dollars on practically nothing.
