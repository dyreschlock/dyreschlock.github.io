| March 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Fucking Amperos.. yet another late night venture ruined by insecurity</p><p>Amperos is an 8 story all-girls dormatory which lies at the bottom of the mountain that Gaidai sits atop of. Gaidai being short for Nagasaki Gaigokokugo Daigaku, which is japanese for Nagasaki Foreign Language University. Through some sorrid twist of fate, they put the girls dormatory right next to the school, but the guys dorm is a mile or two away.</p><p>One year, some guy started harassing some girls and tried to break in through the front. I mean, come on.. who wouldn't right? So, they erected a 7 foot fence circling the perimeter to keep the old perverts out of there.</p><p>That wasn't enough for another old guy, since he just went over the fence and then was free to harass. Steps had to be taken.. They lined their 1 foot thick concrete fences with 2 inter-weaving lines of barbed wire. But only along the landlocked portion of the perimeter.</p><p>Since Amperos is near the bottom of the mountain, its' north side hugs the road the continues up the mountain to gaidai. This has been easy to climb up and jump over before. The south face over looks the mountain as it continues down into a ravine. The drop is about 5 or 6 stories into the runoff river below. So, they must've figured that no one would get in that way.</p><p>This was still an invitation for some guys, who have tried to scale that muddy rock wall to reach the fence and climb right on in. I don't know if they put barbed wire along the south wall yet.</p><p>I think all this over security just breeds challenge for those uninvited. Its not possible to ever be 100% secure. The illusion of all this safety really just puts a big spotlight on yourself.</p><p>Anyways, needless to say, they are pretty strict about the 'girls only' rule. Each person entering the building is greeted by an orderly who stands watch during the hours when Amperos is open. Girls must return to Amperos by 10p or 11p depending on the night or else they are locked out for the evening. I guess they can't pay someone to be at the post 24 hours.</p><p>This whole thing really screws them over when they want to go out for the night to a bar and drink until whenever they've had enough. More over, it screws up a guys night when he wants his friends to join him at beardo. Much like last night.. Of course, the night probably would've been fine if i still had a room at the guy's dorm :/.. oh well</p><p>This is how last night ended.. Hoping a bus back downtown to five's place, getting some sleep and watching Fugitive 2 on the movie channel.</p><p>Overall yesterday was quite fun. I met up with mennat, natalie, miho and tina for dinner. 3 of which live in Amperos.</p><p>I ran into a couple random friends, too. A chinese guy from the forms and a chinese girl from the dance club. Both pretty surprised to see me. My chinese pal's first words to me, after asking why i was here was, "wahh, you're fat".. thank you.. at least someone said what had been on my mind for the past couple weeks. "Americans like to eat a lot of meat," he said, "its so cheap." I love non-westerner simplistic honesty..</p><p>"yeah.. that and i hardly get any exercise, eat fast-food a little too often, and have been developing a fatty recipe for about two months," i replied. Hmm... well there are 3 easy things i can change about my current lifestyle right off the bat.</p><p>Maybe i'll also try utilizing Madison's metro system as an excuse to use my legs for a change. Then again, i'll probably get back and just say fuck it. Its earie how easy it is to be lazy in America. If fast food was healthier, in general, the whole population would start to become just a little bit healthier, in general. It sucks, because all the healthy food in America either tastes bad, takes preparation, or too expensive. Blah blah blah..</p><p>Yesterday also marked plenty of video game shopping. Almost too much, actually..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Back to Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/back-to-japan">Back to Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Now, i'm thinking about what i should do tonight: stay in Fukuoka or bus to Nagasaki. Spend the night at a cybac or an actual hotel..  Or bother five for a night.</p><p>My home away from home.  More exercise and better food..  though, more expensive with no income.</p><p>__</p><p>Also, my slick ass American phone doesn't catch reception over here.  Surprise, surprise.  I think i was supposed to sign up for some international service before i left, though.  Oh well..  It still works as a great text editor.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Vacation Time" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/vacation-time">Vacation Time</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Off to Japan.</p><p>I leave Saturday Morning (right now, actually) and return next Sunday afternoon.  That's about 8 1/2 days; however, subtract 2 days out of that for traveling.  And another 2 days of travel between Fukuoka and Nagasaki.  So i've got about 4 whole days in Nagasaki, which doesn't really seem like a lot :/</p><p>Hmm...  I might actually be able to grab a bus to Nagasaki in Fukuoka right as i arrive.  I should probably arrive around 10pm, and those buses continue until Midnight.  That should probably work.  Then i could probably hit up cybac in Nagasaki, rather than fukuoka.  That would give me an extra day in Nagasaki.</p><p>of course, that would decrease the amount of time spent in Fukuoka.  I think i'd rather do that on the way out though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Game Library" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-library">Game Library</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I ran across a fun thread on the NeoGAF, where people would post all of the games they plan on purchases over the next month, though i think the intent was to post games that had purchased throughout the month..  I thought it was pretty neat.  You can see what people are actually buying, rather than look at sales numbers or just what people are complaining about, or simply what they are playing.</p><p>Concurrently to this, personally, i've been keeping track of all the games i own for well over a year.  I think i inventoried all my games around the Summer of 2004, or sometime in that Fall season.  Actually, maybe it was that christmas break.  Some people at SPAMM had their own game lists, and i knew my game library kicked the ass out of their game library.  So i cataloged.</p><p>Here's the old one: <a href="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html">http://www.theschlock.com/misc/games2.html</a>.  It worked out pretty well.  All the code is stuffed into one html file, which makes updating and upkeep rather easy.</p><p>Of course, no one really gave a shit..  None the less, i kept it updated and linked it from Cheap Ass Gamer like a bunch of other gaming nerds do.</p><p>In recently months, i had actually been doing something similar to what the NeoGAFers had been doing, but only in comment form..  If you view the source of that page, you'll notice after the more recently entries they have a '//added mm/dd/yyyy' after them.</p><p>I hadn't extended this idea to code or design, but that's what i did yesterday.  I think the NeoGAFers were onto something, so i took it and ran with it.</p><p>Here's the new games list: <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/games2.html</a>.</p><p>The games2.html page is pretty much the same.  The only thing i did was pull out most of the javascript and css into their own files for the other page to share..  <a href="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/sales.html</a> is the new file that extends my games list with all my recent purchases.  I also took the idea a little further by adding where i bought the game, and how much it cost.</p><p>Even though, i could probably go back a couple months and fill in information, i think i'm just going to pitch March 2007 as my starting point.  That way it'll be 100% correct, rather than missing a few pieces.</p><p>In the future, it might be fun to start adding in statistic gathering and create Trend graphs and the like.  Before that, i should probably update this with server-side scripting so it loads as fast as possible.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Backlog" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/backlog">Backlog</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Despite considering alternatives, i decided to get in my car and drive up to the twin cities to check out Digweed at that new club in maplewood.  I'd never been a big fan of Digweed..  His Kiss 100 sets never really stuck with me, and i never really listened to his CDs at great length.  I finally just the chance to see him back in 2004 (<a href="/old/v7/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis">pics</a>), and it blew me away.  His progressive style is really brought out by the massive amounts of bass pumped into the atmosphere.  I was quite turned around after that point ^_^.</p><p>On the way up, i stopped off at Best Buy and as luck would have it, they had a copy of Digweed's new CD, Transitions vol. 2.  It's a great listen ^_^</p><p>I got to Myth around 10pm and crap!  This place is huge.  I thought it was pretty hilarious that they a built a club right next to Maplewood mall, but think of the convience!  Hardly any traffic and parking up to wazoo.  Now you'll actually get the people that care about being at that club..  Not just a bunch of drunks bar hopping around Minneapolis' warehouse district.  It's still kinda weird though..  Big fancy ass club nestled in between an Ashley's furniture and Toys R Us.  I probably should've taken a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" /></p><p>Anywho, as i got inside the air was filled with the incredible sounds of Eccentric Beats, Phil Martinez and his pal.  The air was also filled with smoke.  I walked past some staff saying that they couldn't stop it..  By it, they meant the smoke machines, not a fire.  I thought it was rather odd that there was this much smoke in the building..  I mean, you couldn't see but several feet in front of you.</p><p>15 minutes later, this bit the club in the ass as the fire alarm went off.  I thought it was pretty hilarious that some people were still dancing to the fire alarm before they realized it WAS a fire alarm.  Hell, i thought it was music too for a couple of moments.</p><p>The fire alarm went on for about another 15 minutes before they finally got their act together and fixed the problem..  How embarrassing..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" /></p><p>Eventually eccentric beats finally got control of the sound system back and began to rip tracks and tear up the place, but not before Jack Trash came up with a little bit of an announcement.  Mstrkrft, the other main attraction, were apparently stuck in their hotel's elevator upon their embarkment to Myth.  So JT got Digweed to the club as fast as possible while Hotel security tried to free Mstrkrft from their cage.</p><p>It certainly seemed like it was the night of disasters.. jesus.  In fact, Mstrkrft ended up being stuck in that elevator all night and finally got to the club around 2am.. closing time.  But, this meant a full 2 hour long set by Digweed, so it worked out great for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" /></p><p>Digweed came out on stage and began his set around Midnight.  Amazing.  Bass filled the air, and pounded my body.  I was bathed in rich creamy Sound.   Unfortunately, since i don't listen to Digweed all that often, i couldn't trainspot any of the tracks..  His Transitions CD is a good vantage point to reliving this music though...  you just need a wall of bass to actually experience it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" /></p><p>Anywho, my pictures are rather few from this event since i was rocking out up front the entire time in anticipation of getting my Transitions CD signed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" /></p><p>Success!

I was pretty damn surprised to see them, as they were i, but after we thought about it.. duh.  It's Digweed in Minneapolis for godsake.  It was good to see them again ^_^.  I think the last time i ran into them was at Sasha last time he was in Minneapolis (<a href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis">pics</a>).</p><p>Andy works for a cellphone company in the Minnetonka area developing those international chips for cell phones.  Which means he writes assembly all day long in the pursuit of happiness.  Since he works on international soft/hardware he gets to travel quite a bit..  His job has shipped him over to France and Austrailia.  Pretty soon, he's going over to Tokyo too.  All expenses paid, so it's not all bad ^_^.</p><p>So those little international chips that are in those new DoCoMo 'world' phones in Japan are developed back over here in Minneapolis ^_^.  That's pretty slick.</p><p>___</p><p>Anywho, the next huge event going on in Minneapolis looks to be Paul Van Dyk hitting Myth on May 10th.  I'd absolutely go to that, if it weren't on a Thursday..  But, going to Minneapolis affords many opportunities other than musical..  It might be worth a vacation day ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 300" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/300">300</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, my roommates and i all had premiere tickets for the new action-packed Frank Miller comic-book adaptation, <em>300</em> in fitchburg's Imax theater.  300 is about 300 spartans against the invasion of the Persian empire.</p><p>Visually this movie is absolutely stunning.  Few movies have such a rich quality of picture that literally any screen shot is a vivid photo suitable for framing.  It does borrow some special effects from Sin City, where eyes and other light elements of silhouettes are illuminated..  Such as the Persian soldier's eyes as they crept over the hills.</p><p>300 is one of those movies where i have certain expectations coming into the film.  Ya know, i've seen trailers and heard about the story, and all this stuff.  I hype myself up, and when i exit the theaters.. i feel disappointed.  Like the movie totally missed the mark for me.  This is happened with a couple other movies, such as Matrix Reloaded and Scanner Darkly.</p><p>Afterwards, i get home... go to bed..  Throughout the night and the next day, i keep thinking about it more and more, and start appreciating the movie for what it is.. not what i thought or someone else thought it was supposed to be.  You can't judge some romance movie because it didn't have enough action, or comedy because it didn't have enough serious moments..  I don't really know what i was expecting 300 to be, but it stands on its own.</p><p>The movie is pretty much all action and sex and action.  Battles are waged constantly, and the battle scenes are brutally raw and bloody.  I don't think i've ever seen a movie with so much blood, yet not really consider it to be gore.  Blood flies everywhere during most scenes, but it is shed in such a violent and deliberate way..  The blood is almost a living form within the shots.</p><p>As a whole, much like the battle scenes, 300 is terrifically raw.  Half naked muscle man, stumping across the battle field, beating, and stabbing and thrusting spears into each other, yelling at the top of your lungs.  Not to mention other scenes, with naked women telling the future, and seducing the gimp, and being naked.</p><p>This movie screams Man.  It's almost as manly as ripping off your chest hair, or smashing your head into the hood of a car, or other manly feats as scene on that Snicker's superbowl commercial.  It makes you want to join in the action, and scream your head off..  "SPARTANS!" in all of your awesome glory.  Pick up a spear and join the fight.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fried Spaghetti Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fried-spaghetti-recipe">Fried Spaghetti Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

One day, when shopping at the dinner discount grocery store, i came across some spaghetti noodles.  Oh baby, i hadn't had spaghetti in such a long time.  That's what's for dinner tonight!  I picked up a couple boxes, some spices, and went on my merry way.</p><p>At home though, all i had was a frying pan.  I didn't have a strainer or a big 'ol or any of the usual instruments.  My frying pan was kinda deep, so i figured i could just use that and then drain out the water somehow.  I started frying up the noodles and something amazing happened.  All the water in teh pan either boiled off or was absorbed by the noodles..  All that was left in the pan were the noodles, and i used this opportunity to fry them a little bit for the ultimate taste.  I chucked some cheese on them at the same time, and it was the most delicious spaghetti i had ever tasted..</p><p>Once i got back and started cooking again, and sought to perfect this recipe..  Although it's not quite perfect, i think i'm done eating this fatty spaghetti recipe..  i've gained about 15 lbs. in the past 2 months :/  blech.  That's also because i sit down all day now and then watch tv at night.</p><p>Anywho..  on with the recipe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" /></p><p>here's the ingredients i've been using: some spaghetti noodles, olive oil, a bag of lettuce, some shredded cheese, parmesan cheese, delicious spaghetti sauce, delicious alfredo sauce, and some spices such as garlic and organo.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" /></p><p class='img'>Start off by putting some Olive oil in the pan.

| March 6, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, i was testing some ordering processes at work and needed a Credit Card to continue.  I filled out all the fields with random characters to see if i could get with that, but no..  I went through the code to check out the validation and there are 3 things that must be true in order for a Credit Card to be valid before it even considers processing.  One of these things was just that it wasn't expired, but the other 2 dealt with the number itself.</p><p>Since i was inputting a VISA card, the number had to follow a few conventions.  It had to be either 13 or 16 digits long, and had to start with a 4.  Our processing software has a bunch of other card types as well, each with their own conventions specifying the length of the number, and the first couple digits prefixing the number.</p><p>The real interesting requirement was the number had to follow the Luhn Formula, which i later looked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">wikipedia</a>.  The Luhn Formula states that when you double every other number starting from the end up the digit sequence and then add all the digits together, their sum is divisible by 10.</p><p>So...</p><p>If you have a some random number sequence: a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6</p><p>Double every other digit starting from the back: 2(a1) a2 2(a3) a4 2(a5) a6</p><p>Add them all together:  2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6</p><p>They should be divisble by 10:  (2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6) % 10 = 0 (formula 1)</p><p>Moving some things around we'd get this formula if the number of digits are even: ( 2(a(1..n odd)) + a(2..n even) ) % 10 = 0</p><p>So....  this is how i needed to derive my fake Visa number to continue along the ordering process.  I began using the conventions defined with the card type, so that gave me this template: 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.</p><p>Since we take every other digits, let's split up the variables a little bit: 4xyx yxyx yxyx yxyx.</p><p>Plugging this number into our formula, gives us ( 2(4 + 7y) + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 8 + 14y + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 4 + 7y + 4x ) % 5 = 0 (formula 2)</p><p>That 7 is rather annoying, but we've already hit prime with the 5, so you can't really reduce it much further.  Luckily it's in a cute little formula that we could just plug in numbers to find something simple..  This is, of course, if we wanted all x to be the same and all y to be the same.  Otherwise formula 2 would be formula 1.</p><p>Anywho.. looking at formula 2 for a few seconds may give you an answer.  if y = 1 and x = 1, it succeeds.  I've got my fake Visa number 4111 1111 1111 1111, but you could go the easy route and have y = 0 and find x = 4, or x = 0 and find y = 3.</p><p>I suppose it would've been easily if i kept my number as 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.  Then i would've found ( 4 + 11x ) % 5 = 0, and found x = 1 very quickly..  or that i could use x = 6 too.</p><p>After looking into this stuff, i've realized just how insecure this whole system is. It's pretty easy to make up a fake Visa number, but taking a look at that wikipedia article, the Luhn Formula is not meant for encryption, just validation.  Just a little housekeeping, so someone doesn't screw up and type a 5 rather than a 6 and still get a valid number.  This is used for all credit card numbers too, so if you're bored why not double check your Visa number to see if its valid.</p><p>Math is everywhere ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-3">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><b>Java 6 Features</b> w/ Venkat Subranium</p><p>On this third day of christmas I started of in Venkat's Java 6 features talk, which was rather enlightening.  He talked about how Java 6 has integrated the use of scripting languages into the java language and how scripting languages can use the java libraries on their own.  You can also pull in script files into your java code, run them, and play around with the results of the run code.</p><p>Something that peeked my curiosity a little more was the next feature he talked about: instantiated an instance of the compiler and being able to compile and run new code at runtime.  That's freakin' awesome.  You could do some pretty fun AI functionality by setting up some program that would write, compile and run code all on its own.  I think about having just a simple Body class sitting on a server somewhere.  It doesn't have much... just one method that takes in a filepath.  I'll send that sucker an Arm class..  The body reads and runs that Arm class and instantly makes it its own.  Pretty handy.</p><p>Eventually if you quite giving more intelligent body parts it might be able to start writing up code for making its own limbs and the code monster keeps growing...  Then the terminator would come back through time to kill me.</p><p><b>Advanced Selenium</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>Anywho...  the next panel I went to was Selenium which was also pretty slick.  Even though we use Selenium at work, i never really knew what it was about.  I thought it was just some JavaScript testing tool...  but i guess i got that backwards.  Selenium is a testing tool written in JavaScript.  You can, or write Java code to, fill out table information representing actions taken to traverse your website.  Stuff like..  fill in User text field with 'NameString', click on login, click on this and that, buy this, logout, all the while sticking in several asserts to make sure your system is doing what you want.</p><p>This is a fantastic way to test your webframe work.  Just input all your Use cases into Selenium, hit play, and it'll return all the infractions of your Use cases for you.  Huzzah..  No need to run through everything on your own.</p><p>You could also setup Selenium to run a bunch of macros that will get your within your system quicker..</p><p><b>Expert Panel</b> @ Lunch</p><p>After lunch was the expert panel discussion, which had 8 or 9 speakers take questions from the crowd.  The question of 'how should students be taught programming basics and lore when there are so many modern day languages and tools that remove the need to explicitly know about them?' was posed.  Problems are posed when teaching students only Java as language, because then they know nothing of garbage collection and memory leaks.  Problems are posed when teaching students a loosely typed language, because then type know nothing of type casting and such.  Where do teachers begin the learning process, yet still get them up to speed with the technologies of today.</p><p>Everyone on the panel said their peace about their thoughts..  Certainly, the consensus was don't tie them down to one language and CERTAINLY don't tie them down to one platform.  No one language is infinite.  One quote from the weekend was, "Don't think of software as gold bars sitting in a vault..  Software is more like lettuce.  If you let it sit, it will degrade and rot away.. "  This is true with all technologies in this field.  You have to keep current to be a valued member of this industry or else you'll be structurally unemployed sooner than you think.</p><p>This really extends further to almost all industries..  All industries evolve..</p><p>As an addendum, they added, that that's not to say forget about the past..  You don't need to know how to write code at the byte code level, but you should definitely know how that byte level code is used.  You should know the inner workings of the constructs you are building on.  Computers aren't MAGIC..  they are technological devices built on technologies built on technologies..  If you don't know how the technologies you are using as a foundation, then you have no business building on them.</p><p>Another topic brought up during this time was open source technologies with the slogan, "get your ass out there and help out"  Open source communities are the main driver's for developing these technologies, not just creators of the technologies..  The communities are the ones that pick up the left over parts, fix bugs and clean up the code which shapes and completes the projects..  Even if you needed a selfish reason to work on something, think of the scenario of coming into a job interview and being able to say that you worked on that open source technology that that company is currently using.  Dump that on your resume.</p><p><b>Reflection</b> w/ Ted</p><p>After such stirring lunch conversation, the sessions started up again.  I attended Ted ___'s guide to reflection.  Reflection is basically making an object that is the representation of a class.  This object has all the methods and fields, but this is not an instantiation of the class itself.  With reflection you can actual get to private data and methods..  Which is handy in some instances..</p><p>This is also how annotations are utilized.
