"i know what my top couple games are.. but what are all my top favorite games of all time.. there are so many games that i've played over the past 20 years.. could i possibly remember them all?".. well i think i have, and i assembled a list that i think is a perfect representation of my top 20 games of all time..</p><p>you may notice that my list is 21 games, and not 20.. well, after making my list of games i forgot about Gran Turismo, so i had to add it in there somewhere and i just couldn't knock off my 20th game.. i'm sure i'm missing some games too.. anyways...</p><p class='img'>21. <b>Ultima Online: The Second Age</b> - Origins / PC / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" /></p><p>i just couldn't bump it off the list.. it's the first MMORPG i played, and i loved it quite a bit, even though all i did was mine ore north of britania all day long, and then occasionally go on adventures. i had some great times, playing with my friends from art college, although i never got into PK'ing people as much as they did.. one time they came back with a house deed. oh man, a few moments i felt bad for that poor schmuch eager to make his home amogst the forest.. but that went away when we made that home our home ^_^.</p><p class='img'>20. <b>Fzero GX</b> - Sega/Nintendo / Gamecube / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" /></p><p>Racing has always been a favorite genre of mine.. thanks to wipeout and gran turismo.. although, for me, that genre was brought by games like Need for Speed and Test Drive.. games based on the action aspect of racing, rather than depth. although Fzero is similar to NFS and TD, the action, graphics and enviroment add to atmosphere and topped with excellent music ^_^. Fzero GX brought life back into the sub genre of futuristic racing where Wipeout Fusion had failed..</p><p>I loved this game from the very start, but it wasn't a soft love.. this game had such learning cliff, must people never played it for too long because they couldn't get anywhere in it. Even though i failed numerous times, i had a blast.. so i kept getting better, inch by inch passing the games little tests. This was a game you had to work at, and i loved every minute.. even the times i couldn't withstand how pissed i was for getting knocked off the course at the very end of a grand prix. ^_^</p><p class='img'>19. <b>Ikaruga</b> - Treasure / Gamecube ver. / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" /></p><p>Another game that was tough as nails.. One that you had to work at and understand in order to play it to the best of your ability.. It a beautiful mix of complexity and chaos, where patterns exist, and deciphering the patterns is just the first part of learning the game..</p><p>The first time i played this game was thanks to #five, who burned it for the dreamcast. tough as hell.. when the 'ol spamm house played this game, we couldn't get past stage 2. although it wasn't until i played it during the christmas break on the gamecube that i really got into it, as i did just a little better than i remember.. stu and i played the game the whole weekend trying to get just a little bit further, and a little bit further.. we were hooked ^_^.</p><p class='img'>18. <b>Megaman 2</b> - Capcom / NES / 1989<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" /></p><p>this was the first megaman i played.. and also the first megaman i beat.. although i never owned it, i rented it on at least 4 seperate occasions.. the whole robot theme fighting other robots appealed to my nerd nature, and i fell in love ^_^.</p><p class='img'>17. <b>Rez</b> - Sega/UGA / Playstation 2 ver. / 2002<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" /></p><p>earlier on in the decade, i used to check NCSX everyday to learn of imports, and other various games of the japanese nature.. This game showed up one day, and i had no idea what it was.. it came out in japan for $80.. just a bit too pricey for me at the time, so after half a year passed by and saw it on the release date list at eb, i picked up their last copy the day it came out.</p><p>this game had the familar style of panzer dragoon, but overwhelmed me with the vector sytlized graphics and deep organic electric music.. this game was a unique gaming experience that i only come close to feeling with the wipeout series.. it was magic ^_^.</p><p class='img'>16. <b>Megaman 3</b> - Capcom / NES / 1990<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" /></p><p>following Megaman 2, i caught wind that megaman 3 had just been released thanks to nintendo power. my parents actually bought it for me, even though they never buy anything.. whoo hoo.. since i actually owned the game, i played it much much more than megaman 2..</p><p class='img'>15. <b>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</b> - Sega / Genesis / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" /></p><p>back in the day.. i loved the side scrollers.. i saw the commercials for the sega genesis all the time.. and then the sega genesis included Sonic the Hedgehog.. it was at this point, i was able to convince my parents to buy me one ^_^.. although i played the first one to death, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 had all the elements of the first game with the addition of the ring world, super sonic and much more memorable music.. overall, i loved this game alot more than the first ^_^.</p><p class='img'>14. <b>GoldenEye 007</b> - Nintendo / Nintendo 64 / 1997<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" /></p><p>I played this game all the time with my best friend.. we were absolutely equal in skill at this game, and we played for HOURS.. school would be the morning, and then we'd work at Toys R Us in the evenings.. we'd get off work at 10pm and then go back to his house, and play Goldeneye into 2 or 3am in the morning on a school night. we'd do this just about every night. it was a regular daily event.. Truly one of my fondest gaming memories ^_^.</p><p class='img'>13. <b>Toe Jam and Earl</b> - Sega / Genesis / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/toejam.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/toejam.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/toejam.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/toejam.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/toejam.webp" /></p><p>my favorite genesis game.. yet another title which i played so much that i'm sure my old genesis controller are slightly warped from overplay ^_^. it featured kooky characters who pretended to be idiots. and since they were aliens, it appealed easily to my nerdy side ^_^. i used to doodle toe jam and earl while in class</p><p class='img'>12. <b>Wip3out</b> - Psygnosis / Playstation / 1999<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeout3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeout3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeout3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeout3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeout3.webp" /></p><p>wipeout 3 is probably the most beautiful racing game i've ever played.. it featured simplistic polygon graphics, solid racing gameplay, and a soundtrack arranged and written by my favorite DJ sasha.. the wipeout series with some help from stu is what got me into electronic music. wipeout 3 took the idea of wipeout and rounded it all together in a harmonic package, rather than the darker grittier wipeout xl.</p><p class='img'>11. <b>Chrono Trigger</b> - Squaresoft / Super Nintendo / 1995<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronotrigger.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronotrigger.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronotrigger.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronotrigger.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronotrigger.webp" /></p><p>Final Fantasy was pretty fun, but with Chrono Trigger beat it out in numerous ways. Chrono Trigger was non-linear, featured better music (in my opinion), slightly better battle system, etc.. I had a lot more fun with Chrono Trigger than Final Fantasy VI.. for some reason.</p><p class='img'>10. <b>Gran Turismo 3</b> - Polyphony Digital / Playstation 2 / 2001<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" /></p><p>back in high school, i used to play Racing quite a bit more than i do these days, and when i first saw the realistic looking graphics i couldn't wait to play it. The thing that set Gran Turismo apart from other racing games was the in-depth management of cars. all other racing games were just about the racing, and even gran turismo took that a step further with realistic play control. and took the graphics a step further as well. the first complete racing simulation.</p><p>Gran Turismo 2 took the management one step further, but the graphics weren't that much better. I played both games quite a bit, but i didn't love it quite as much as Gran Turismo 3 because at that time i had friends much more into gaming. We all got the game when it came out and played it all simultaneously. every couple of days we'd get together and race each other with our cars we've been using ^_^. no other racing game could compare to Gran Turismo 3.</p><p>unfortunately my over playing of Gran Turismo 3 tainted me for Gran Turismo 4. i was so hyped for GT4, that i bought all the GT Concepts, and GT4 Prologue, and i loved those games, but when GT4 came out, it was just GT3 all over again.. and unfortunately i was burnt out, and no friends to compete against either. sadness</p><p class='img'>9. <b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b> - iD software / PC / 2001<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" /></p><p>One weekend back at the beginning of college, Stu came to visit and brought a new game with him.. Wolfenstein. We installed it on my computer and didn't leave the room for 2 days after.. The multiplayer aspect was addictive and engaging, but the best part was that everybody sucked at the game. it was new and everybody who played the game was new at it.. it wasn't full of people who would kill everybody and then not get scratched. we were all on the same level, which only added to the addictivity.</p><p>after that weekend, i picked up my own copy and played constantly ^_^. i eventually joined a clan and we picked off several lesser clans.. unfortunately, i got out of the game when the summer came around and i no longer had the strong connection to the internet the school provided.. i tried playing again since then but couldn't get back into it... sigh..</p><p class='img'>8. <b>Final Fantasy VIII</b> - Squaresoft / Playstation / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" /></p><p>known to many as one of the worst final fantasies. i fell in love with this game the moment i heard of it's existance. I played Final Fantasy VII quite a bit, but FFVII retained a cartoony nature that didn't set the game in reality. When i first saw screenshots of FFVIII, i was blown away. A Final Fantasy where the characters actually look like real people..</p><p>Everytime a little bit of information was released about the game, i ate it up. I imported Brave Fencer Musashiden, so that my friends and i would have the first glance at the game in action, and we were not dissapointed at all. It had a slightly more futuristic feel than FFVII, the character's had more substance.. i eventually beat the import at the Arts Institute, when i brought it in to show off.. ^_^</p><p>Overall though, the game was pretty bad. the story was absolutely terrible, and the gameplay was so radical to ever work correctly. it was the characters and the setting that won me over.. it's the idea that makes it my favorite final fantasy, and certainly not the game itself.</p><p class='img'>7. <b>Chrono Cross</b> - Squaresoft / Playstation / 2000<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" /></p><p>As a sequel to Chrono Trigger was announced, i watched the news closely to everything that was leaked little by little. and when i finally got a hold of the trailer, i was blown away by the graphics, the characters, and most of all, the music.. I imported it the day it came out, and loved it. The graphics were the best i had seen on the playstation, and the music flowed through me as i played the game. there were times, i just set down the controller and just listened.</p><p>the story was interesting, and made you think. The characters were beautifully concepted, as well as some of the enemies. this game was in it's own world, and that set it apart from Final Fantasy or any other RPG i've played before. I think Chrono Cross is the RPG that i've played through the most.. i played through the japanese version twice, and then the american version a time and a half.</p><p>It scares me to think that one day Squaresoft was will Chrono Break, and it will suck so bad that all creditibility of the Chrono series will die off.. Yoichi Wada has ruined that company enough.</p><p class='img'>6. <b>Wipeout XL</b> - Psygnosis / Playstation / 1996<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" /></p><p>This was the first wipeout i played, and it blew me away.. i mean, i played Fzero before but it was nothing like this game.. Wipeout was futuristic racing in the deep dark dirty future.. The environments you faced in had the dirty industrial feel of the over industrialized future.. and had music to match. The featured music was the perfect example of the growing underground music scene. it was so wicked. It brought about such an underground feel to the game itself, especially when featured in the hit movie Hackers. ^_^</p><p class='img'>5. <b>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b> - Nintendo / Nintendo 64 / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" /></p><p>The 3D make-up of my favorite 2D game at the time, did not dissapoint me. ^_^</p><p class='img'>4. <b>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</b> - Nintendo / Super Nintendo / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" /></p><p>I played alot of side scrollers, and other action type games earlier on in my life, Zelda was one of my first experiences with an overhead type adventure, which i thought was much more expansive than your typical side scroller, and on top of that wasn't as 'kiddy' as super mario, it was a true hero's adventure.</p><p>this was also the first Zelda i played as well, i went back and tried to play the original and zelda II, but they couldn't compare against the 16bit juggernaut which had more options, side-quests, story elements, and better graphics.</p><p>overall, i think Zelda Minish Cap is a better game, for the same reasons i think Zelda 3 is better than Zelda 1, however playing through Minish Cap was really just an updated version of the original sprite based adventure.

It has been around since the mid eighties, and these days is still one of the biggest tests of gaming ability.</p><p>Back in the day, i used to play the gameboy version all the time (much like all these games, really).. i'd take it somewhere and play. sometimes another kid would have one with and i would battle against him ^_^, usually winning.</p><p>These days, i still play Tetris the Grand master on MAME, but i'm not as great as the greatest players in the world.. maybe i should work on that ^_^.

| June 13, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>well, after a very rough and busy semester, coming back home was a bit different. so much free time. nothing to do. so i finally got plenty of time to play a bunch of video games. and a bunch of video games i have played.. most of the bad. some of them VERY good. here we go, in order of recollection:</p><p><b>Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Adventure</p><p>Sigh.. Konami cannot make a good 3d Castlevania. It's setup very good. the maps are designed as well as Symphony of the Night in a 3d Atmosphere. But the gameplay is so unrefined. Jumps are jadged, attacks are stoic. it's just bad.. the story seems pretty mediocre. you are trapped in a castle and dracula is taunting you. "he's playing a game".. too bad it's as bad as the actual game. the cutscenes add to the boredom with slow and drawn out dialogue. overall, not the good. <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Adventure</p><p>3D is not Castlevania's Cup of tea, but it absolutely excels at 2D. Aria of Sorrow is everything a new Castlevania game should be. It derives from the regular recipe. It takes place in 2035, 36 years after Dracula's death in 1999 (i'm not sure what storyline this follows). At this time, several people have climbed to a shrine to view a lunar eclipse. as the eclispse occurs, Dracula's castle emerges and those at the shrines are transported to the castle.</p><p>You control Soma Cruz, one of these people, who has an uncany ability to control slain monsters. anyways.. Aria of Sorrow perfectly emulates the gameplay of Symphony of the Night and adds the abilties of slain monsters. It's very good. A must own for fans of Symphony of the Night. <font color="red">5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Adventure</p><p>although, Castlevania doesn't always do 2D correctly. well, not consistantly anyways. the gravity of Circle of the Moon is very low as it seems belmont has difficulty jumping. slow on the up-sky, fast on the down-sky. it's really annoying going from Aria of Sorrow to Circle of the Moon. I'm not sure why, but controlling someone other than Belmont makes for a better game, but story-wise and gameplay-wise. the old Belmont versus Dracula is so old. it's more interesting when different. anyways.. <font color="red">1.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>XGRA extreme g racing association</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Futuristic Racing</p><p>i ended up buying this game since Extreme G3 was pretty decent afterall, even though Acclaim makes horrible games. i guess they just got lucky once with Extreme G3, unfortunately XGRA tried too hard. Career mode begins with a gigantic learning cliff. XGRA is pretty fast and intense, but you can hardly see the track. you can't turn precisely enough to make the turns and always knock yourself into walls. although, that's not to say the game is difficult. it took me 10-15 seconds to figure out R1 is the accelerate button, and i eventually caught up to other bikes and took 1st place on a 3 lap race, even with hitting the walls continuously. well it was the first race in the game. the music selection in the game is releatively poor too. way too much BT and not enough underground hits as with Extreme G3.</p><p>overall, the game was pretty disappointing, but Extreme G3 isn't perfect either. i think i should probably give the game a second chance, but i think i'll need to emerse myself in it to start liking it. at the moment <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Stella Dues</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Strategy RPG</p><p>this was the first game over the summe that i actually decided to put alot of time into (i ended up giving up this game for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow). As read in the previous thread, Stella Dues is quite a game. It features beautiful artwork and compelling gameplay, although the difficulty brings down the game. It's not the type of hard where you die all the time, it's the type of hard where you have to pay attention to everything you do during battle. Battle complexity can make regular encounters last 30-40 minutes, which is annoying. I want to progress in the story and not have to spend my time in battle all the time. Plus the sub-par voice acting begins to loose its appeal, along with the uninspired story. overall <font color="red">3 out of 5</font></p><p>the next 3 games are all developed by famed cult favorite Treasure.</p><p><b>Sin and Punishment</b> - Import Nintendo 64 - Rail Shooter</p><p>Sin and Punishment is considered one of their best games ever created, however it couldn't have been made on a worse console. I can't play this game. it's just a horrible presentation. if the revolution can play this game with crisp graphics and a controller that features naturally gameplay, i'll be able to give it a better review. but i cannot control the character with my thumb and press the Z button to fire at the same time. um.. come to think of it, i could change the controls (at least i think i can).. hrmm.. maybe i'll do that and try again. nothing can save the blurry 15 fps, though. at the moment <font color="red">2 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Stretch Panic</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Platformer</p><p>as i was sifting through games in the cheapy bin at wal*mart i found this little game. a treasure game for $15? .. sign me up. Stetch Panic is pretty interesting and quite unique. you control the character with the left stick and with the right stick, you control stretch, a shadow light hand which grabs parts of enemies and the enviroment. it's a unique concept but you need to have a game to compliment your game engine. all you do is walk around stretching and snapping enemies with no idea why your shadow can stretch things, nor what you're doing defeating these big breasts enemies. what the hell? <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Astro Boy</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Action</p><p>Treasure has been disappointing so far. although both the previous titles have their good attributes in other genres, Treasure excels at side-scrollers and shooters. the 2D monolith and Astro Boy is gloriously 2D. Astro Boy features a variety of different attacks you can use on your enemies like punching, kicking, and finger laser. punching is your basic attack, while kicking will topple enemies into each other. the laser will pierce enemies hitting a whole row of baddies. As you progress through the game you can power up aspects of Astro Boy to be more offensive, defensive, or aware of secrets. It's $20 well spent for your gameboy advance library. sometimes the play control of the gameboy gets a little awkward. i could probably have a better time with the game on a gameboy player <font color="red">4 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Contra Shattered Soldier</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Action Shooter</p><p>As mentioned in the deal thread, i picked up a copy of Contra Shattered Solider for pretty cheap. This game is fricken tough. Jesse and Zach don't lie. You have 3 lives to clear a level, during which they are thousands of way to die by accident. and overall you have 3 or 4 continues that which to beat the entire game. i have no idea how many levels there are. this game takes a bit of time to learn and master, but it's all very systematic. enemies and obstacles all appear in the same spots each time, so eventually knowledge can master Contra. but it's an intense ride. and the game has a story too. (very little of which i have been able to see, as i have only been able to beat the first level). overall <font color="red">3.5 out of 5</font></p><p>Lately i've been playing a lot of shooters. I've bought a couple and also played a couple arcade roms as well. in particular, one series that is very good is Vasara.</p><p><b>Vasara</b> - Arcade - Vertical Shooter</p><p>The story of Vasara is set in the Waring States Period of Japan as Nobunaga has begun has conquest/uniting. you take control of one of 3 characters to battle the armies of Nobunaga. stage by stage you destroy his forces and in the final showdown fight Nobunaga himself. the gameplay is quite solid, as it provides difficult and unique arrays of bullets, while having the perfect sized hit box to dodge them with. The main controls are fire and bomb. you can hold down the fire button to charge a slash attack which deflect bullets. Throughout the level, when you kill enemies your Vasara bar fills. When it's full your normal charge slash becomes a Vasara slash, which is about 3 times your nomral shot. 3 times the size, the power, and the duration. it's what you use against the boss ^_^.</p><p>On top of that, the added challenge is to kill named soliders of the war. These soldiers are usually regular enemies in yellow, mini-bosses and regular bosses. Probably names of actual samurai from the past. Each level has 20 regular samurai, plus 3 for the miniboss and boss.</p><p>overall, Vasara is quite challenging and has more to it than just shooting down everything, although that helps too. <font color="red">4 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Vasara 2</b> - Arcade - Vertical Shooter</p><p>Vasara was pretty unique and fun, and Vasara 2 actually adds to the experience with more options and added more challenging level of difficulty. you can choose normal or hard. Normal is about as challenging as the first game, whereas Hard steps it up a notch with twice as many levels, more bullets, and tougher bullets.</p><p>Vasara 2 refines the named Samurai system as well. Everything level has exactly 20 regular samurai, 4 mini-bosses and 1 boss, so you actually know what you need to kill.</p><p>Vasara 2 also expands on the Vasara system. You can now stock up to 3 Vasara, and then use the bomb button to activate them, rather than your regular charge shot. This makes normal really easy because you'll always have one ready to take out a mini-boss when you encounter one, rather than taking an entire level to charge up one and only one Vasara.</p><p>Vasara 2 is a beatiful sequel, and i play it much more than the original, even though the were released less than a year apart. I guess the developers really wanted do more with Vasara after they released the first one, and then quickly refined it ^_^. <font color="red">4.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Mars Matrix</b> - Domestic Dreamcast - Vertical Shooter</p><p>Another shooter i've gotten into is Mars Matrix by the good folks at Capcom. Mars Matrix is pretty intense. tons of enemies, tons of bullets. much like Vasara, your charge shot deflects bullets, which is extremely useful in many cases. Enemies attacks have a good variety of random and structured shots. Bosses can be predictable, but most enemies will sometimes throw you for a loop and have you dodging constantly to the point you are amazed you didn't die ^_^. i love hitboxes.</p><p>Mars Matrix has the added system of experience. everything you kill drops a golden cube and when you reach certain amounts your attack becomes more powerful. this has you running after golden cubes, while dodging bullets and shooting down enemies. you are always moving around, and always have you keep track of bullets. it's pretty intense ^_^</p><p>Near the end of the Dreamcast's short life, It was released over here in the states and was pretty hard to track down for a decent price. thank god for game crazy. overall <font color="red">4.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Zelda: Oracle of Seasons</b> - Domestic Gameboy Color - Adventure</p><p>After completing Castlevania, i wanted some more gmaeboy games to dive into. Zelda Minish Cap is on the list, but i don't want to pay $30 and i hadn't played Oracle yet, so i decided to spend $10 at my local gamestore and purchased the red version of the game.</p><p>It's pretty good, though still restricted when compared with A Link to the Past. Oracle of Seasons is quite linear, but it hides itself well. it takes a little bit to figure exactly what to do and where to go. It's pretty solid, but not very ground breaking. maybe if i start playing the blue version, something interesting will come out of it. <font color="red">3.5 out of 5</font></p><p>______________________</p><p>so this is where i'm at for the moment. I'm currently in level 7 of Zelda battling my way through those annoying knights. After which i'll be down 12 games so far this summer with a number of others on my plate. After Zelda i'll probably start playing Metroid Zero Mission on the gameboy, and then maybe start in with Shadow Hearts.</p><p>Though there are plenty of games i want to play too. like Metal Gear Ghost Babel for the gameboy color, Zelda Minish Cap on the gba, Mekai Kingdom coming out in about a month, In the Groove which comes out by the end of the week, Metal Slug Advance on gba, and maybe even Metroid Fusion if i like Zero Mission.</p><p>what games has everyone else been playing lately? .. any good ones? post your thoughts ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Magic Knight Rayearth impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/magic-knight-rayearth-impressions">Magic Knight Rayearth impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 19, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><div class='title'><b>Intro / History</b></div><p>for those who don't know, Magic Knight Rayearth is an action rpg based off the popular anime series by Clamp. early in the year 1998, the saturn unleased its last batch of games: Panzer Dragoon Saga, Burning Rangers, Shining Force III, and House of the Dead.. i was working at Toys R us at the time, we got only 4 copies of each game, and after that we never got anymore saturn games at all. The saturn had died..</p><p>but towards the end of the year, after Xenosaga and Metal Gear Solid came out for the playstation, speciality gaming store like Electronic Boutique and Funcoland (at the time) received very few copies of Magic Knight Rayearth as a new release, after the saturn's death. i think i remember a few people talking about some game that came out for the saturn at EB, but Toys R us never got a copy for me to take a look at.</p><p>skip ahead 6 years to last christmas break. i found a pretty good deal on ebay for Magic Knight Rayearth, so i picked it up. Then I learned that my saturn was missing it's a/v cable, and i also lost all my saturn controllers as well.. so over the course of the previous semester i had been putting it back together, so to speak. i got a saturn controller from eau claire during no brand con, and then a found a saturn a/v cable online when surfing around.</p><p>with my saturn complete, i arrived home last week, and started to play.</p><div class='title'><b>Impressions...</b></div><p>like most Working Designs game, it's chalk full of voice acting, and anime cutscenes. It took about an hour into the game, until i was actually able to walk around and do some fighting. overall, the game is quite dissapointing.. i suppose that's why i never really heard anything about it after it first came out.</p><p>The game plays just like the old 16-bit Zelda. You have your overhead view of your characters, and then you slash at enemies to kill them. You have 3 characters that you can switch back and forth to and from at will.</p><p>There's Hikaru whose magic element is fire. even though she's kind of the leader, i think she's the weakest one of them all. her slash is generally the same as Link's slash. very close range, i usually get hit by whomever i'm trying to kill before i land an attack.</p><p>Next, there's Umi whose magic element its water/ice. She's the smart one of the group, and her attacks are more useful than hikarus. She also has a sword, but she's a fencer so she attacks forward with more range, plus she takes off more damage than hikaru.</p><p>Finally, there's Fuu. She's the calm collective bitch of the group. Her element is Wind and Healing. Her weapon is a bow and arrow, so she's best with range attacks, although they are quite weak. Her powered up shot, sends 3 homing arrows off to kill enemies. She's the most useful of the group.</p><p>After playing this game a little more and a little more, i realize just how bad it is.. I think A Link to the Past had better, more realistic sounding sound-effects than this game. Plus, when there are more than 15 or 16 sprites on the screen at once, the saturn lags. thats terrible. especially when there's a version of this game on the super nintendo that probably runs seemless.</p><p>plus i get so bored, running around doing meanille tasks, that i just can't play it for hours on end. i usually switch to tv, or go outside for a little while before coming back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So.. Overall, Magic Knight Rayearth isn't all that great. I have no idea why it is so rare, but i'm glad i didn't pay the $120 most people ask for it online. if you are a die hand Magic Knight or CLAMP fan that most see everything there is, then i suggest you rent it.. (and by rent it, i mean check out the snes rom)</p><p>Next...</p><p>i may have my saturn working, but it still doesn't save games. once i fix the memory problem, i'll start playing Panzer Dragoon Saga again, unless i get suckered into buying/playing Eternal Mana or Stella Dues.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anime Video Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anime-video-games">Anime Video Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

(at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to One Piece" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/one-piece">One Piece</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Almost every person, friend or enemy, has a power. So, to keep 'em all straight I thought it'd keep track of all the Devil's Fruit that have been uncovered in the story line in order of appearance, for the most part.</p><p>I put all these details on <a href="/pages/one_piece.html" title="/pages/one_piece.html" title="/pages/one_piece.html">this page</a>.</p><p>Luffy's fruit was uncovered in the first episode. And a couple episodes later, the next fruit was uncovered.  The next episode that mentions a different fruit is episode 49 when Alvida returns.  The first 50 episodes of the series has only 3 fruit. Then, the next 50 episodes have 11 fruit.  There were about 2 or 3 per story arc. </p><p>Speaking of story arcs, I made a list of those as well so when we show One Piece at SPAMM on the weekends, we could show the episodes of story arcs, rather than just a set number of episodes per week.</p><p>Episodes 1 : Luffy Intro<br/>Episodes 2 - 3 : Zoro Intro<br/>Episodes 4 - 8 : Captain Buggy<br/>Episodes 9 - 17 : Ussop Story<br/>Episodes 18 - 19 : Luffy & Zoro Story<br/>Episodes 20 - 30 : Sanji Story<br/>Episodes 31 - 44: Nami Story<br/>Episodes 45 - 53 : Buggy & Rogue Town<br/>Movie 2 : The Clockwork Island Adventure<br/>Episodes 54 - 61 : Apis & Dragon's Nest<br/>Episodes 62 - 63 : Laboon & Vivi Intro<br/>Episodes 64 - 67 : Whiskey Peak<br/>Episodes 68 - 69 : Coby Story<br/>Episodes 70 - 78 : Little Garden<br/>Episodes 79 - 91 : Chopper Story & Drum Kingdom<br/>Episodes 92 - ?? : Vivi & Alabasta<br/>Movie 3 : Rare Monster Island, Chopper's Kingdom</p><p>We'd really only be able to get through a certain amount of episodes each week.  And, by the looks of things, we'll probably need to cut in the middle of some of the story arcs, too.</p><p>Looks like the longest story arc in One Piece is 12 episodes long, and the average looks to be around 9 or 10. This is unlike Dragonball Z whose story arcs round out around 30 with main story arcs of 100 episodes.  One Piece has an overall story goal, but the story arcs round out well enough.</p><p>Ya know, the beginning of One Piece was quite fun and the fun continues on through the point they make it to the Grand Line (episode 61). But after that, the whole caliber of the series begins to drop. Before, the fights were more serious and had more emotion. Now it's become a joke. There hasn't been any contest at all. Luffy easily kicks their asses. No suspense, thats it. Hopefully when they fight Crocodile the 'intensity' will return.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Stressed Out!

I worked all Friday and Saturday grinding away at Modern Algebra and SPAMM upkeep. My brain was fried, so I couldn't concentrate today. There's still so much that needs to be done before school finished in 4 weeks.</p><p>Because I was sick, I decided to eat a bunch of ramen! I'm out of eggs, so I just ate the ramen straight with no fancy additions.</p><p>Today was all about <b>Maruchan Brand Ramen Noodle Soup Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>I cracked open my 6-pack that I purchased for a mere 81 cents. It was the deal of the century! 81 cents for 6! I ate 2 earlier. Later on, I ate a third without even cooking it! I just munched on the noodles, and saved the seasoning for the next meal.</p><p>Man, I don't know why people are so down on Maruchan brand ramen. Of course, it's not the best. But it is not terrible. It's the perfect par in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good flavored soup. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good noodles. And, it doesn't fail at the combination of the two, either.</p><p>I'd say that I ate pretty well today for a net total of 50 cents. What else could you possibly buy for 50 cents? You couldn't buy a Snickers bar. You couldn't buy a bottle of soda. You could buy one of those jumbo gumboils. Or, a hand full of that other crap. But, enough to feed you for a day? No, sir. It also started to heal my illness, too!</p><p>Anywho, despite most people's opinions, I give Chicken Maruchan Ramen a par score of <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. Man, I'm going to buy a few more of these 6 packs before they sell out. I also need eggs, bread, and tuna, and maybe something else to make into fried rice.</p><p>Holy crap! I just noticed that there are recipes on the back to create more interesting dishes. Two of them are standard salads, so who the fuck cares. The other one makes an interesting soup. I should buy some mushrooms and veggies to make this.</p><p>—</p><p>The other day, I had some ramen out of my non-trash stash. I picked out this crazy Korean stuff, <b>Secret Samyang Brand Roasted Chajang Chacharoni Noodles</b>. Secret only because the brand name was hidden on the other side of the package. Hiding something, maybe?</p><p>It was certainly interesting. Everything seemed normal until I added the seasoning into the mix. As I squeezed out the beef stuff, it looked like globs of black ink. It didn't want to come out. When it did, it was heavy and stuck together. After I got most of it out of the pouch, I stirred and blended it into the soup. It turned instantly dark! The noodles absorbed a good amount of the ink, too.</p><p>It tasted pretty good! Though, I'm not sure what was in the other pouch. It could've been cat food for all I know. Little crunchy looking pellets that seemed to disappear once they were added in the soup</p><p>It was quite different than any ramen I've had before. Though, it wasn't all that great. I give Samyang's Roasted Chajang Chacharoni a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Interesting stuff, though there is better. Worth at least one try.</p><p>—</p><p>For my second entree, I wanted something I knew would be crap. I wanted to balance out of the meal with what I just had. I also wanted to save the good stuff, too. I ended up going with <b>5-Minute Express Instant Ramen Noodles Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>These were the cheap Canadian noodles I found at the Dollar store. </p><p>Not a whole lot can be said about this stuff. It also had a solid base with no extra bells or whistles. No veggies or strange soup altering agents. Just simple noodles, and simple soup.</p><p>All in all, I thought it was good. But after my Maruchan Chicken binge earlier today, it pales in comparison to the standards of the United States. I gave 5-Minute Express Chicken Ramen a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Not only does Maruchan taste better, but it's cheaper, too. For the same price, I could get an alternative flavor of Maruchan, rather than Chicken.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to School Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/school-work-and-ramen">School Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All those software projects have backed up since my group and I didn't meet last night. Now, we have to scramble today to catch up. We have a lot of work to do in the next week. I have lots of assignments due tomorrow, too. @_@</p><p>Sigh, but in other news, I had some more ramen this afternoon. Some pretty good stuff, too!</p><p>First off, I had <b>Samyang Brand Sutah Ramen Rich Hot Flavor</b>.</p><p>I saw this package, and I immediately thought, "Holy shit! This is what I'm having today!" Although, I am skeptical now when making Samyang ramen. All their previous ones had turned into sludge, and this is not what I want. Maybe this one would have, too, but I made some corrections. After placing the noodles in the water, I added a little more water. It cooled down the boil, but I let it sit for a few minutes.</p><p>This meal was quite extensive, like the Nong Shim stuff. There was a pouch of soup base, a pouch for the veggies, and another pouch of solid base. I put the solid base in the water first. A little alter, I added the veggies, soup base, and an egg, too.</p><p>This stuff turn out FANTASTIC! Extremely delicious. I was surprised. Although, it makes sense given the quality of packaging and ingredients. It was pretty hot & spicy, but just right for my taste buds. The noodles and seasoning blended perfectly together for the slightly baked taste. Great stuff! I give Sutah Ramen a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Nice job!</p><p>Secondly, I had <b>Nissin Brand Instant Noodles Prawn Flavor</b>.</p><p>Prawn is another specie of Shrimp, by the way. This ramen is also known as the one with the little ramen guy running around on the cover.</p><p>I am a little biased towards Seafood flavored noodles because I LOVE seafood quite a lot. And this stuff totally delivered on the taste. Very seafood-esq. Though, the overall quality of the dish was similar to the cheapness of Maruchan and other American brand noodles. Chucks of crab may have saved this dish, so maybe I'll try that next time.</p><p>Anywho, I give this one a <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. It wasn't bad, but it lacked in overall style and deliciousness.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ramen Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ramen-catchup">Ramen Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I think I fucked up making it or something. They are supposed to be udon noodles, so making them in the microwave is a bit tricky. It takes a lot longer for the noodles to absorb the boiling water and soften. Now, it's no longer a problem for me because I'm using a stovetop. Cooking ramen over heat is the absolute best way to get the best taste out of the instant noodles.</p><p>This stuff was quite good this time. I don't remember how it ended up last time. Probably, the noodles were still hard and tasted funny. Not this time, though. The noodles absorbed the water and seasoning beautifully, and tasted so delicious. The soup was also quite delicious. The perfect blend of spice, veggies, and egg. No ramen sludge. I give Nong Shim's Seafood & Spicy Udon Noodles a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Extremely delicious! And extemely recommended.</p><p>---</p><p>Next up, to counter the Korean excellent, I went with the instant bowled <b>Nissin Brand UFO Yakisoba Oriental Noodle w/ Soup Base</b>.</p><p>Yes, UFO as in Unidentified Flying Object, as spelling out on the cover. I don't get it, but this stuff was certainly NOT out of this world.</p><p>It's not possible to make Yakisoba how it was illustrated on the cover. It can only end up being noodles with yakisoba flavoring. And the yakisoba flavoring tasted like runny meat. It wasn't as bad as that Ichiban Yakisoba, though. This stuff didn't have that crappy taste, and it pulled itself together a little bit. Someone who actually liked yakisoba would proably like it. I give UFO Yakisoba a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I don't think it's possible to make a truly good instant Yakisoba.</p><p>---</p><p>And finally, last week sometime, I made <b>Myojo Brand Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Crab Flavor</b>.</p><p>Speaking of noodles you can't possibly translate into an instant meal, udon noodles will never turn out how they are supposed to. Completely absorbent of their seasoning and meat products soaked in the soup. I tried to boil them longer with the soup base in the broth, but it just doesn't work.</p><p>None the less, this stuff didn't turn out too bad. I find it really odd how well eggs break up in the soup base when making these refrigerated instant meals. It's really weird. Also weird, this stuff tasted nothing like crab. It tasted more like that Chicken flavor in the Maruchan brand ramen. Next time I make this stuff, I certainly must add in that immitation crab they sell at my local grocer. That'll prove to be a delicious meal. But, in the mean time, Myogo Udon Noodles gets a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Better luck next time.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Daily Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/daily-work-and-ramen">Daily Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, it's still early in the week, and I've got plenty of time to do everything. I plan to jet over to Madison tomorrow to do some banking, but I can't stay there for too long. I gotta get back and get stuff done!</p><p>Today for lunch, I filled up with <b>Samyang Brand Sogokimyun Ramen</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" /></p><p>This stuff ended up just like the previous Samyang Ramen...  Sludge. I added a little more water this time, but still, it ended up in sludge. Although, it was very tasty sludge. Pretty good, in fact. It had a very robust strong flavor. Not all THAT great, but pretty good. <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>BUT! After that, I had <b>Sapporo Ichiban Brand Kitsune Japanese Style Noodle</b> with Fried Bean Curd & Soup Base.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" /></p><p>This stuff...  I can't began to describe this stuff. It began looking promising. But, the hint of beef in the seasoning prepared me for a runny meat texture. Cooking the stuff wasn't so bad. The noodles were shaped into a square, but not in a manufactured way, like the Maruchan stuff. The noodles were fatter than regular noodles, too. They seemed to be randomly arranged, but broke apart in the boiling water nicely.</p><p>Inside, with the soup base, there was a chunk of fried bean curd. I'm not very judgey when it comes to food, so I threw it all in the dish. I don't konw if it was supposed to break apart in the water, but it did not. It stayed together as one big chunk while it cooked and even after. Actually, looking at the wrapper, maybe I'm supposed to cut it out.  Oops. I put the whole thing in my mouth and took a bite. *BARF* Ugh. I can't desribe how terrible this stuff tasted. I think the closest taste I could compare it to is vomit. At least, that's exactly how my mouth tasted after I spit it into the garbage. Maybe it's better when cut?? DO NOT eat that thing whole.</p><p>Even after that, the ramen did have that runny beef texture I had prepared for. The noodles were really good, though. I give this one a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Sapporo Ichiban has potential, but I don't know why they keep fucking up. There must be an excellent Ichiban Ramen combination out there. This will be my future goal when I return to the Asian market.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM Trip and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-trip-and-ramen">SPAMM Trip and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

We went to the Korean Market, which had a whole aisle of instant noodles! KOREAN instant noodles. The best kind! I bought some bean sprouts and a bunch of ramen for $7.24. The concluded with our dinner at Ginza. I didn't order too much (only $12). It worked out because other folks ordered too much, and I ate their food.</p><p>Then, we returned back to Platteville to the SPAMM house, drank, and played Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.</p><div class='title'><b>Later...</b></div><p>Even though I skimped on food in Madison, I've totally blown my food budget for the month. I mean, I have enough food to last for a while, but I really need to pay attention to how much I spend.</p><p>Anywho, with this in mind, let's eat some ramen! Tonight I began with <b>Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" /></p><p>There were very helpful instructions on the back: <br/>Step 1 - Boil Noodles<br/>Step 2 - Cook in the Soup Base and Veggies<br/>Step 3 - Cook in the Solid Base (and add an egg and whatever else)</p><p>This is now my preferred method of cooking noodles.</p><p>Perhaps the most underrated feature of Nong Shim instant noodles is that noodles come in a circular disk, rather than a square. It breaks apart in the water naturally. AND it actually fits in the pot perfectly. Square noodles have an awkward shape that I need to squish into my pot. Also, square noodles don't really break apart naturally. There are always chunks stuck together, which tear the noodles. Circular noodles stay fit, so you'll have one continuous noodle in the end. ^_^</p><p>Secondly, the veggies from Nong Shim complement the taste of the soup perfectly. So delicious. I added in some bean sprouts and an egg to this ramen, and they soaked up my of the broth's flavor.</p><p>Overall, this stuff was exteremely delicious. I give Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Don't miss this stuff! If you live in Madison, but the 5-pack. I think it was only $3!</p><p>After the delicious stuff, I tried a different brand rather than eating all of my Nong Shim stuff on the first day. I went with <b>Samyang Foods Brand Kimchee Ramen</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" /></p><p>It was rather interesting, much like the preview Ottogi Brand Jin Ramen. I don't know if it's the noodles, the soup base, or the amount of water or heat, but the whole thing came out like sludge. Very heavy. I cooked it the same way as the Nong Shim Brand stuff, but it came out as sludge.</p><p>Ramen sludge isn't all that different than normal ramen. The taste is still there. The noodles stick together a little bit, so it's difficult to pull them apart while you eat.</p><p>It wasn't bad, though. Still better than normal American noodles. Although, it cannot stand up against the Nong Shim excellence. I gave Samyang's Kimchee a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Good effort, mate! Perhaps I should try again and avoid the sludge to experience what you were going.</p><div class='title'><b>Later yet...</b></div><p>I played a lot of DDR Revivial tonight. I was so hungry that I couldn't go to bed, so I made some of the refrigerated udon noodles, <b>Chikara Brand Udon Hot & Spicy Oriental Style Noodes</b>. I bought them a while ago.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" /></p><p>Hot & Spicy is the over statement of the century here. Although, not surprising from an American company.</p><p>These turned out pretty good, but there's got to be a better way to cook them. Udon noodles are supposed to absorb the taste and have a meaty structure. These noodles were very watery with little taste. I don't get it. Although, because of this, the egg breaks up more naturally compared with cooking the dried out instant noodles. Almost like egg drop soup. ^_^</p><p>Overall, I give Chikara's Udon Spicy Noodles a <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>. These noodles never seem to turn out right, and I'm probably not the reason. I will need to experiment further next time.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/76">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/74">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
