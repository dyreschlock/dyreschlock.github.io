| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the past couple of weeks, there has been a steady stream of xbox 360 things in my living room.. First there was a controller, then a memory card, then Perfect Dark Zero, and then tuesday night, there was an Xbox 360.</p><p>I watched my roommate play PDZ a little bit, but i wasn't really all that impressed.. the graphics looked hokey, and the character movements were pretty primitive.</p><p>After my rough day of studying, testing and finishing up projects, and between playing Chaos Field i decided to check it out since it was just sitting there.<br/>________</p><p>The Xbox 360 is differently designed than all other systems i've played before.. including PC games. When you start up the Xbox 360 and it loads a game, the 360 requires a login. the 360, not the game. You can have multiple profiles on one 360, and each profile needn't have Xbox live. But you must be logged in to play games.</p><p>The game uses this profile for saving progress, records and other data, besides the most import use of having an Xbox Live persona. Each account has it's own settings and data for every game played with that profile.</p><p>So unlike PC games, ps2 or gamecube where each person would have a seperate save file for their data, all data is organized by profile, so if you want your stuff, you only need log in the 360 under your name and the system tells the game which file to load for you.</p><p>very impressive. data management is a snap.</p><p>The wireless controllers have a more user-friendly design than the wavebird controllers. Once you start up the machine, you hit the Xbox button on the controller. It'll assign itself to the xbox, and then light up part of the Xbox button showing which player number it is. This is also represented on the front of the 360 showing how many controllers the system recognizes.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what'll happen when you have 2 Xbox 360 consoles next to each other and attempt to register controllers.. I wonder how they solve this problem.</p><p>Aside from that, it REALLY REALLY REALLY annoys me that the Xbox 360 isn't backwards compatible with every Xbox game. I can play Fable, but i can't play Metal Slug 3 or Fatal Frame 2 or Panzer Dragoon Orta or Crazy Taxi 3. worthless... that was my saving grace for buying some of these games. i could play them now on other's xboxes, and later i can play them on my xbox 360. so much for that one.<br/>_________________</p><p>anyways, my roommate is a huge console fps fan, so naturally he picked up the Xbox 360's flagship title: Perfect Dark Zero.</p><p>PDZ is pretty dissapointing in my opinion. This opinion is pretty justified when my roommate came home last night with a copy of Quake 4 to play instead of this game.</p><p>Perfect Dark Zero is exactly the same game it was 5 years ago with alot of graphical upgrades. The AI will not use any clever tactics to try and take you down. An enemy will not think twice of walking into a room that has your gun fixed on the door. Every single time, i can pop outside and fire a clip. Then duck back into the room, and wait for their slow ass to run in the room, stand in front of me and wait a second for me to shoot them dead.</p><p>Not to mention that the character animation is so stoic, it looks like they used the same animation from the Nintendo 64 game. It feels exactly the same in appearance. how lazy can you be....</p><p>so far i've made it up through Mission number 5 at this point, and the story is absolutely cliche and horrible. Joanna is presented as Lara Croft clone with her veteran pal, Joe, presented as a Bruce Willis clone. Halo 1 and 2 are FAR more interesting than this game, even they are pretty cliche as well.</p><p>Playing this game is pretty annoying, but it's rather addicting at the same time..</p><p>The graphics haven't blown me away at all... there have been some things i've stopped to look it and thought, "that's looks pretty neat.." But then i turn away and get back to the mission. Most of the graphics are have pretty standard for Playstation 2, but the powerful lighting effects of the Xbox 360 pull everything together to give it a clean crisp shiny look.</p><p>On occasion though, the lighting effects look really hokey. Especially when you're infiltrating this chinese palace covered in snow. The snow gives off a blue hue in the moonlight night, but the orange from the fire defuses the reality and makes the enviroment look CG.<br/>____________</p><p>anyways... Perfect Dark Zero thus far has been pretty unimpressive, but it's still kinda fun.. from the purchase of Quake 4, it obviously won't hold over my roommate until Halo 3 comes out next year sometime.</p><p>I'd like to see some great games on the machine though. Fable 2 should be amazing. I really hope they bring Tetris the grand master stateside. I also look forward to Ninety-Nine Knights, Blue Dragoon, and a few other games.. maybe even Final Fantasy XI and Rumble Roses XX.</p><p>The Xbox 360 is pretty well designed, but it feels more like an Xbox 1.5 than a whole new system. The Xbox 360 graphics don't look ALL that better than the Xboxes.. for the time being, anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to News and Recent Shmups" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/news-and-recent-shmups">News and Recent Shmups</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As the weeks continue to wash on by our lives, and the year almost comes to a close, my list of anticipated games becomes less anticipation, and more realization. Most of these games have come out and i have had a great time with ^_^.</p><p>Yesterday, another one of these gems finally came out: <b>Chaos Field</b> for the gamecube. Chaos Field is an updated port from the Dreamcast version which came out exactly one year ago.</p><p>Like most modern shooters, Chaos Field has it's own little quirks and variations on the genre. Many of these quirks are reminiscent of Ikaruga. After destroying enemies, energy cubes with fall from the foe that will fill up your energy meter to the side of the screen. You can use your energy meter for 2 different types of attacks. One attack will lock onto your enemies and attack them with a seeking ray. The other one, though, is shield that will absorb bullets around you.</p><p>One of the more basic maneuvers of your ship, besides firing bullets, is using your sword. The sword can attack your opponent, but also absorb all standard bullets around you, which doesn't make bullet dodging particularly easier.</p><p>The real joy of Chaos Field is change. When beginning a level and in standard combat, you are fighting in the Order Field. At, roughly, any point in time, you change this from Order to Chaos. All of your attacks and defenses become more powerful, however the enemy's attacks become far more rampant. Attacks are more various than in order, hence the name.. chaos. With this addition to the gameplay, you are really playing two different versions of the game.</p><p>You can choose between 3 different ships with very different attacks. Hal's ship is the standard bullet firing ship, which has a static shield for defense. Isumi's ship has some very weak homing lasers, and rotating fire balls for defense. (and) Jinn's ship has a very powerful yet infrequent energy blast.</p><p>Much like modern shooters, Chaos Field awards big points to those who use the combo system correctly. In order to rack up combo points, you must use your energy defense and attacks very frequently to destroy your opponent.</p><p>It's pretty fun, but what really annoys me about the game is each stage is just a solitary boss. For each part of the stage, you're just damaging the boss, bit by bit, until it's completely destroyed. There are no lackies that you can easily destroy, or difficult stage that you must venture through in order to reach the boss. It just all boss fights. oh well.</p><p>The graphics aren't really mind-blowing. In fact, they aren't really mind-blowing for Dreamcast graphics.. They are pretty standard graphics that the Nintendo 64 could probably handle. In one instance, during the second part of the first stage, you're flying right next to a building while battling another ship. The textures for this building is black with bright blue lights indicating windows, which considerably gets in the way of dodging bullets of the same color. I almost get a headache trying to focus on the bullets in front of this background.. luckily i'm not seizure prone.</p><p>but.. as stated above, it's pretty fun and quite challenging. I wouldn't recommend this anyone, though. I'd give it a <font color="red">3 out of 5</font>. If you want a shooter on the gamecube, you need not look further than Ikaruga. However, if you're a fan of shooters, be sure to check it out. ^_^ It's a mere $30 at your local gamestop.</p><p>I'm pretty satisfied with it. In most instances, a Shooter is a Shooter is a Shooter.<br/>____________________________</p><p>As mentioned above the original Chaos Field came out on Dreamcast on Dec 14, 2004 in japan, which might be surprising.. The dreamcast is pretty well dead, but thanks to hardcore shooter fans it still breeds new life. Chaos Field is not the dreamcast's final game though..</p><p>Just this past April, Trizeal was released on the dreamcast as well. Ironically enough, it's limited release outsold a very bad PSP game released on the same day.</p><p>http://spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=2947</p><p>News from a few days ago, indicated that even Trizeal will not be the dreamcast's final game.. Milestone, the creators of Chaos Field, have another shooter coming to the short-lived system. Radilgy will be released on February 16th, 2006.</p><p>Unfortuantely it's very difficult to find information on this game, but from a few screenshots it looks cell-shaded?.. :shrugs:<br/>____________________________</p><p>This news was pretty neat ^_^ and it reminded me of an article i read several weeks ago that caught my eye.</p><p>Alfa Systems announced that Shikigami no Shiro III (Castle Shikigami III) has been in development for a while and will be released in Japanese arcades by February 2006. Alfa Systems has developed all 3 shikigami no shiro games, and also developed Elemental Gearbolt.</p><p>Shikigami no Shiro is a pretty standard shooters with it's own little quirks as well. It has coined the phrase Bullet Hugging, where if your character comes within a certain range right next to a bullet, their attacks become twice as strong.</p><p>The shikigami series is probably known to have the worse localization of any game to date thanks to XS games. Back in 2003, they got their hands on the NA distribution rights to Gunbird and Shikigami 1. They completely gutted the games and slapped on a new title for these completely unrelated games. Gunbird was now Mobile Light Force on playstation, and Shikigami 1 was now Mobile Light Force 2 on playstation 2. In Shikigami, all the cutscenes and character defining traits were taken out of the game, leaving only the core gameplay. With a new name, the game was given an "appriopriate" cover art...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" /></p><p>compared to..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" /></p><p>horrible... ugh.</p><p>but XS games had learned the error of their ways when getting the NA distribution rights to Shikigami 2 and released it with everything in tact, including horrible voice acting.<br/>__________________</p><p>anyways.. i'll bring Chaos Field to the LAN party tonight for people to check out.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anticipating Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anticipating-games">Anticipating Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

O-3 and Sega have confirmed that they are bringing Chaos Field to the states before the end of the year. like most good modern day shooters, it first appeared on the dreamcast and was ported over to the gamecube earlier this year in japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Odama</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/odama.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/odama.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/odama.webp" /></p><p>Odama sounded like a pretty innovative concept. It's a Real-time Strategy Pinball game. you knock the pinball around the battle field taking out troops, it hopes to aid your comrads in battle. It should be out in Japan before the end of the year, no concrete date though.</p><div class='title'><b>Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/zelda.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/zelda.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/zelda.webp" /></p><p>Legend of Zelda has always been one of my favorite game series. It never ceases to amaze me, and the hype surrounding Twilight Princess sounds very positive. I cannot wait ^_^. unfortunately it'll be quite a while before it comes out.</p><p>_____________________________</p><div class='title'><b><u>Playstation 2</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>We Love Katamari</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/katamari2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/katamari2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/katamari2.webp" /></p><p>i love katamari damacy ^_^. even though the sequel doesn't seem to make any drawdropping advancements, sometimes you can't mess with perfection. an $30 expansion is fine with me. it comes out September 7th or 14th.</p><p>http://www.spamm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2445<br/>http://www.spamm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3155</p><div class='title'><b>Shadow of the Collosus</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/wanda.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/wanda.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/wanda.webp" /></p><p>this is game looks magnificent. i've been following it since the first announcement. it's created by the same Sony team that brought us ICO. ICO took a whole new depth to puzzle adventures, and complimented it with an environment that was it's own little world. Now they've taken their simplistic game design approach towards Boss Battles. you fight 15 different collosi in Shadow, each one drastically different than the others. You must use you cunning to figure out how to topple these mammoths. I cannot wait. It is scheduled for release in Japan by September 17th (i think)</p><p>http://www.spamm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2328</p><div class='title'><b>Magna Carta</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/magnacarta.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/magnacarta.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/magnacarta.webp" /></p><p>South Korea's answer to Final Fantasy. they game looks fantastic with amazing visuals and art. It has a fairly large fanbase as well, so it can't be that bad. i'd like to see what it's all about. of course, it's a lot easier to find artwork and fanart of the game than information about the game itself. Should come out in November.</p><p>http://www.spamm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2778</p><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistance</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/mgs3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/mgs3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/anticipation/mgs3.webp" /></p><p>i loved Metal Gear Solid 3, but i never bought it.. i was weary after MGS2.

I asked Tom, the pharmacist, "Why did a product that was clearly for humans need to be labeled 'human'?  Is there some specific animal insulin or...?"  "No no.." he replied.</p><p>Up until around 1991, the pharmacuetical industry used animal insulin injected into humans.  Mostly from farm animals such as cows and pigs.  It worked, but it wasn't perfect.  Numerous times, the diabetic's body would attack parts of the insulin that didn't match with our DNA resulting in an unsightly pocket underneath the skin.</p><p>With advancements of cloning, insulin culturers began to grow human bacteria and used them to produce actual human insulin. This is the insulin we know and use today to help balance levels within diabetics, and is why the box specifically said Human on it, rather than Pig or Horse.</p><p>The new insulin is a perfect match to our DNA structure with no side effects from the cloning process. So, they've been steadily phasing out the old barnyard insulin for the past decade or so since the cloned insulin is nearly flawless.  </p><p>Everyday advancement in the pharmacuetical industry is made, as chemical compounds in drugs are refined and condensed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Harry Potter #6" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/harry-potter-6">Harry Potter #6</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I got to Batman Begins somehow, and from there went to Christian Bale to check out his movies.  Besides the movie listing, there was a picture of him from the movie Equilibrium, a movie that i have never heard of, so i checked it out.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" /></p><p>The description compared it to the Matrix and Brave New World, says that it was a futuristic thriller where society is the enemy.  This sounded pretty good, so i went out to Best Buy and picked up a copy.</p><p>Bad Move.</p><p>While Equilibrium sounds pretty good on the surface, i was quite disappointed with the results.  All the promo's on the DVD jacket stated that it's gun fighting techniques were top-notch, however in execution, the were too over-the-top, set to horrible background music, and just looked goofy.  This movie prides itself on it's gun fighting, but there's not enough of it, and it's awkward in execution.</p><p>The story of Equilibrium is set in the future, when society has developed a drug to supress emotions in humans, since emotions are what triggers conflict, war, etc.  Society has a team of police that hunt down anyone not taking the drug, and they also destroy anything that has to do with emotion.  The future is completely black and white.  Sounds pretty pretentious.</p><p>What was really disappointing was the acting.  or perhaps it was acted so well, that Christian Bale perfectly executed the dull process of a emotion-less tool into a senseful human.  Christian Bale himself is pretty emotionless in his acting in the first place..  perhaps he wasn't the best choice.</p><p>Christian Bale is an interesting fellow, though.  I hardly EVER hear about him at all, yet he has a little cult following known as Bale-heads.  He's extremely buff yet acts in B movies, aside from Batman Begins.  American Psycho was the only other movie i remember him being in that i have actually seen, and ever then i didn't ever know his name.</p><p>anyways..  the story was par, i'd say.  there were too many plot twists at the end that made it unbelievable, not that the story wasn't pretty far-fetched in the first place.</p><p>I really should have rented this movie if i wanted to see it..  oops.  It puzzled me why there wasn't a copy at any of the used movie stores i went to, and i have come to the conclusion that no one bought the movie in the first place..  They must have rented it instead.</p><p>Though i still kinda like Christian Bale, i think i'll check out <b>The Machinist</b> next.  apparently, in preparation for the movie he lost 63 pounds to fit the role, and then after shooting he gained it back for the Buffed up Bruce Wayne.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Your 20 Favorite Games of all time" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/your-20-favorite-games-of-all-time">Your 20 Favorite Games of all time</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

"i know what my top couple games are.. but what are all my top favorite games of all time.. there are so many games that i've played over the past 20 years.. could i possibly remember them all?".. well i think i have, and i assembled a list that i think is a perfect representation of my top 20 games of all time..</p><p>you may notice that my list is 21 games, and not 20.. well, after making my list of games i forgot about Gran Turismo, so i had to add it in there somewhere and i just couldn't knock off my 20th game.. i'm sure i'm missing some games too.. anyways...</p><p class='img'>21. <b>Ultima Online: The Second Age</b> - Origins / PC / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" /></p><p>i just couldn't bump it off the list.. it's the first MMORPG i played, and i loved it quite a bit, even though all i did was mine ore north of britania all day long, and then occasionally go on adventures. i had some great times, playing with my friends from art college, although i never got into PK'ing people as much as they did.. one time they came back with a house deed. oh man, a few moments i felt bad for that poor schmuch eager to make his home amogst the forest.. but that went away when we made that home our home ^_^.</p><p class='img'>20. <b>Fzero GX</b> - Sega/Nintendo / Gamecube / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" /></p><p>Racing has always been a favorite genre of mine.. thanks to wipeout and gran turismo.. although, for me, that genre was brought by games like Need for Speed and Test Drive.. games based on the action aspect of racing, rather than depth. although Fzero is similar to NFS and TD, the action, graphics and enviroment add to atmosphere and topped with excellent music ^_^. Fzero GX brought life back into the sub genre of futuristic racing where Wipeout Fusion had failed..</p><p>I loved this game from the very start, but it wasn't a soft love.. this game had such learning cliff, must people never played it for too long because they couldn't get anywhere in it. Even though i failed numerous times, i had a blast.. so i kept getting better, inch by inch passing the games little tests. This was a game you had to work at, and i loved every minute.. even the times i couldn't withstand how pissed i was for getting knocked off the course at the very end of a grand prix. ^_^</p><p class='img'>19. <b>Ikaruga</b> - Treasure / Gamecube ver. / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" /></p><p>Another game that was tough as nails.. One that you had to work at and understand in order to play it to the best of your ability.. It a beautiful mix of complexity and chaos, where patterns exist, and deciphering the patterns is just the first part of learning the game..</p><p>The first time i played this game was thanks to #five, who burned it for the dreamcast. tough as hell.. when the 'ol spamm house played this game, we couldn't get past stage 2. although it wasn't until i played it during the christmas break on the gamecube that i really got into it, as i did just a little better than i remember.. stu and i played the game the whole weekend trying to get just a little bit further, and a little bit further.. we were hooked ^_^.</p><p class='img'>18. <b>Megaman 2</b> - Capcom / NES / 1989<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" /></p><p>this was the first megaman i played.. and also the first megaman i beat.. although i never owned it, i rented it on at least 4 seperate occasions.. the whole robot theme fighting other robots appealed to my nerd nature, and i fell in love ^_^.</p><p class='img'>17. <b>Rez</b> - Sega/UGA / Playstation 2 ver. / 2002<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" /></p><p>earlier on in the decade, i used to check NCSX everyday to learn of imports, and other various games of the japanese nature.. This game showed up one day, and i had no idea what it was.. it came out in japan for $80.. just a bit too pricey for me at the time, so after half a year passed by and saw it on the release date list at eb, i picked up their last copy the day it came out.</p><p>this game had the familar style of panzer dragoon, but overwhelmed me with the vector sytlized graphics and deep organic electric music.. this game was a unique gaming experience that i only come close to feeling with the wipeout series.. it was magic ^_^.</p><p class='img'>16. <b>Megaman 3</b> - Capcom / NES / 1990<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" /></p><p>following Megaman 2, i caught wind that megaman 3 had just been released thanks to nintendo power. my parents actually bought it for me, even though they never buy anything.. whoo hoo.. since i actually owned the game, i played it much much more than megaman 2..</p><p class='img'>15. <b>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</b> - Sega / Genesis / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" /></p><p>back in the day.. i loved the side scrollers.. i saw the commercials for the sega genesis all the time.. and then the sega genesis included Sonic the Hedgehog.. it was at this point, i was able to convince my parents to buy me one ^_^.. although i played the first one to death, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 had all the elements of the first game with the addition of the ring world, super sonic and much more memorable music.. overall, i loved this game alot more than the first ^_^.</p><p class='img'>14. <b>GoldenEye 007</b> - Nintendo / Nintendo 64 / 1997<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" /></p><p>I played this game all the time with my best friend.. we were absolutely equal in skill at this game, and we played for HOURS.. school would be the morning, and then we'd work at Toys R Us in the evenings.. we'd get off work at 10pm and then go back to his house, and play Goldeneye into 2 or 3am in the morning on a school night. we'd do this just about every night. it was a regular daily event..

I had a lot more fun with Chrono Trigger than Final Fantasy VI.. for some reason.</p><p class='img'>10. <b>Gran Turismo 3</b> - Polyphony Digital / Playstation 2 / 2001<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" /></p><p>back in high school, i used to play Racing quite a bit more than i do these days, and when i first saw the realistic looking graphics i couldn't wait to play it. The thing that set Gran Turismo apart from other racing games was the in-depth management of cars. all other racing games were just about the racing, and even gran turismo took that a step further with realistic play control. and took the graphics a step further as well. the first complete racing simulation.</p><p>Gran Turismo 2 took the management one step further, but the graphics weren't that much better. I played both games quite a bit, but i didn't love it quite as much as Gran Turismo 3 because at that time i had friends much more into gaming. We all got the game when it came out and played it all simultaneously. every couple of days we'd get together and race each other with our cars we've been using ^_^. no other racing game could compare to Gran Turismo 3.</p><p>unfortunately my over playing of Gran Turismo 3 tainted me for Gran Turismo 4. i was so hyped for GT4, that i bought all the GT Concepts, and GT4 Prologue, and i loved those games, but when GT4 came out, it was just GT3 all over again.. and unfortunately i was burnt out, and no friends to compete against either. sadness</p><p class='img'>9. <b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b> - iD software / PC / 2001<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" /></p><p>One weekend back at the beginning of college, Stu came to visit and brought a new game with him.. Wolfenstein. We installed it on my computer and didn't leave the room for 2 days after.. The multiplayer aspect was addictive and engaging, but the best part was that everybody sucked at the game. it was new and everybody who played the game was new at it.. it wasn't full of people who would kill everybody and then not get scratched. we were all on the same level, which only added to the addictivity.</p><p>after that weekend, i picked up my own copy and played constantly ^_^. i eventually joined a clan and we picked off several lesser clans.. unfortunately, i got out of the game when the summer came around and i no longer had the strong connection to the internet the school provided.. i tried playing again since then but couldn't get back into it... sigh..</p><p class='img'>8. <b>Final Fantasy VIII</b> - Squaresoft / Playstation / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" /></p><p>known to many as one of the worst final fantasies. i fell in love with this game the moment i heard of it's existance. I played Final Fantasy VII quite a bit, but FFVII retained a cartoony nature that didn't set the game in reality. When i first saw screenshots of FFVIII, i was blown away. A Final Fantasy where the characters actually look like real people..</p><p>Everytime a little bit of information was released about the game, i ate it up. I imported Brave Fencer Musashiden, so that my friends and i would have the first glance at the game in action, and we were not dissapointed at all. It had a slightly more futuristic feel than FFVII, the character's had more substance.. i eventually beat the import at the Arts Institute, when i brought it in to show off.. ^_^</p><p>Overall though, the game was pretty bad. the story was absolutely terrible, and the gameplay was so radical to ever work correctly. it was the characters and the setting that won me over.. it's the idea that makes it my favorite final fantasy, and certainly not the game itself.</p><p class='img'>7. <b>Chrono Cross</b> - Squaresoft / Playstation / 2000<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" /></p><p>As a sequel to Chrono Trigger was announced, i watched the news closely to everything that was leaked little by little. and when i finally got a hold of the trailer, i was blown away by the graphics, the characters, and most of all, the music.. I imported it the day it came out, and loved it. The graphics were the best i had seen on the playstation, and the music flowed through me as i played the game. there were times, i just set down the controller and just listened.</p><p>the story was interesting, and made you think. The characters were beautifully concepted, as well as some of the enemies. this game was in it's own world, and that set it apart from Final Fantasy or any other RPG i've played before. I think Chrono Cross is the RPG that i've played through the most.. i played through the japanese version twice, and then the american version a time and a half.</p><p>It scares me to think that one day Squaresoft was will Chrono Break, and it will suck so bad that all creditibility of the Chrono series will die off.. Yoichi Wada has ruined that company enough.</p><p class='img'>6. <b>Wipeout XL</b> - Psygnosis / Playstation / 1996<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" /></p><p>This was the first wipeout i played, and it blew me away.. i mean, i played Fzero before but it was nothing like this game.. Wipeout was futuristic racing in the deep dark dirty future.. The environments you faced in had the dirty industrial feel of the over industrialized future.. and had music to match. The featured music was the perfect example of the growing underground music scene. it was so wicked. It brought about such an underground feel to the game itself, especially when featured in the hit movie Hackers. ^_^</p><p class='img'>5. <b>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b> - Nintendo / Nintendo 64 / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" /></p><p>The 3D make-up of my favorite 2D game at the time, did not dissapoint me. ^_^</p><p class='img'>4. <b>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</b> - Nintendo / Super Nintendo / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" /></p><p>I played alot of side scrollers, and other action type games earlier on in my life, Zelda was one of my first experiences with an overhead type adventure, which i thought was much more expansive than your typical side scroller, and on top of that wasn't as 'kiddy' as super mario, it was a true hero's adventure.</p><p>this was also the first Zelda i played as well, i went back and tried to play the original and zelda II, but they couldn't compare against the 16bit juggernaut which had more options, side-quests, story elements, and better graphics.</p><p>overall, i think Zelda Minish Cap is a better game, for the same reasons i think Zelda 3 is better than Zelda 1, however playing through Minish Cap was really just an updated version of the original sprite based adventure. You can change the story all you want, the best part of Zelda is the true quest of the Master Sword v. Ganon.</p><p class='img'>3. <b>Tetris</b> - Nintendo / Gameboy / 1989<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" /></p><p>There's no other game that i have as much respect for than Tetris. Tetris is the chess of the video gaming world. (well.. probably more like checkers, really). It has been around since the mid eighties, and these days is still one of the biggest tests of gaming ability.</p><p>Back in the day, i used to play the gameboy version all the time (much like all these games, really).. i'd take it somewhere and play. sometimes another kid would have one with and i would battle against him ^_^, usually winning.</p><p>These days, i still play Tetris the Grand master on MAME, but i'm not as great as the greatest players in the world.. maybe i should work on that ^_^. They need to release a GOOD recent console version of one of the arcade games. Tetris the Grand Master on PS2. c'mon, port it already!!</p><p class='img'>2. <b>Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Import</b> - Konami / Playstation 2 / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" /></p><p>Dance Dance Revolution is one my favorite games, and my favorite DDR game has got to be DDR Extreme Japan.. no other home version has this many songs crossing this many genres.. there is something for everyone. i've made friends playing this games, and have had some of my favorite times in college playing this game with these friends ^_^. ontop of that, there has been no other game that has come close to the amount of time i've spent on this game.. i've played it for almost two years straight.. lost weight, toned leg muscles.. and i still play it today every now and then when i get bored of ITG.. no other game has changed my life, the way this one has.</p><p class='img'>1. <b>Snatcher</b> - Konami / Sega CD / 1994<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" /></p><p>When i first played this game, i was blown away.. there was nothing else like it that i had experienced.. the story was the most unique take on andriods possing as people, much like terminator.. (at the time, i hadn't heard of blade runner).. gillian seed was so interesting, and the voice acting just astounded me. and the music, my god the music was something i had remembered for so long..</p><p>originally i borrowed it from a friend, and hadn't seen it since.. i could not find this game no matter where i looked, and still have not found a copy to this date. but some of you know that i came across the playstation import at a preplayed earlier this year, and played it a little bit.. after which i searched through the internet, i came across the ROM. and played it twice through immediately after.. ^_^. the graphics are beautiful for a decade old game, the story and characters are so rich.. all the memories came right back.</p><p>________________________________</p><p>there you have it ^_^. i actually spent quite a bit of time writing this post as well.. took me about a day, to first collect all my favorite games, rank them, and write a little paragraph or two about the game and reasons why it is my favorite..</p><p>There are quite a few games that i still consider my favorite but i couldn't put them in the top 20, games like final fantasy vii, final fantasy tactics, vagrant story, perfect dark, earthworm jim 1 and 2, katamari damacy, crazy taxi, dr. mario, animal crossing, pikmin, nights, virtua tennis, metal gear solid 3, tenchu, ssx 1, zelda minish cap, other ddr mixes like ddrmax usa and others i'm sure i'm forgetting.<br/>__________________________________</p><p>It's not as easy as it looks ^_^, but it's fun at the same time, making it a challenging little exercise. i'd like to see what your top 20 games of all time are as well, so feel free to come up with your own list.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Summer Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/summer-games">Summer Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 13, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>well, after a very rough and busy semester, coming back home was a bit different. so much free time. nothing to do. so i finally got plenty of time to play a bunch of video games. and a bunch of video games i have played.. most of the bad. some of them VERY good. here we go, in order of recollection:</p><p><b>Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Adventure</p><p>Sigh.. Konami cannot make a good 3d Castlevania. It's setup very good. the maps are designed as well as Symphony of the Night in a 3d Atmosphere. But the gameplay is so unrefined. Jumps are jadged, attacks are stoic. it's just bad.. the story seems pretty mediocre. you are trapped in a castle and dracula is taunting you. "he's playing a game".. too bad it's as bad as the actual game. the cutscenes add to the boredom with slow and drawn out dialogue. overall, not the good. <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Adventure</p><p>3D is not Castlevania's Cup of tea, but it absolutely excels at 2D. Aria of Sorrow is everything a new Castlevania game should be. It derives from the regular recipe. It takes place in 2035, 36 years after Dracula's death in 1999 (i'm not sure what storyline this follows). At this time, several people have climbed to a shrine to view a lunar eclipse. as the eclispse occurs, Dracula's castle emerges and those at the shrines are transported to the castle.</p><p>You control Soma Cruz, one of these people, who has an uncany ability to control slain monsters. anyways.. Aria of Sorrow perfectly emulates the gameplay of Symphony of the Night and adds the abilties of slain monsters. It's very good. A must own for fans of Symphony of the Night. <font color="red">5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Adventure</p><p>although, Castlevania doesn't always do 2D correctly. well, not consistantly anyways. the gravity of Circle of the Moon is very low as it seems belmont has difficulty jumping. slow on the up-sky, fast on the down-sky. it's really annoying going from Aria of Sorrow to Circle of the Moon. I'm not sure why, but controlling someone other than Belmont makes for a better game, but story-wise and gameplay-wise. the old Belmont versus Dracula is so old. it's more interesting when different. anyways.. <font color="red">1.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>XGRA extreme g racing association</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Futuristic Racing</p><p>i ended up buying this game since Extreme G3 was pretty decent afterall, even though Acclaim makes horrible games. i guess they just got lucky once with Extreme G3, unfortunately XGRA tried too hard. Career mode begins with a gigantic learning cliff. XGRA is pretty fast and intense, but you can hardly see the track. you can't turn precisely enough to make the turns and always knock yourself into walls. although, that's not to say the game is difficult. it took me 10-15 seconds to figure out R1 is the accelerate button, and i eventually caught up to other bikes and took 1st place on a 3 lap race, even with hitting the walls continuously. well it was the first race in the game. the music selection in the game is releatively poor too. way too much BT and not enough underground hits as with Extreme G3.</p><p>overall, the game was pretty disappointing, but Extreme G3 isn't perfect either. i think i should probably give the game a second chance, but i think i'll need to emerse myself in it to start liking it. at the moment <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Stella Dues</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Strategy RPG</p><p>this was the first game over the summe that i actually decided to put alot of time into (i ended up giving up this game for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow). As read in the previous thread, Stella Dues is quite a game. It features beautiful artwork and compelling gameplay, although the difficulty brings down the game. It's not the type of hard where you die all the time, it's the type of hard where you have to pay attention to everything you do during battle. Battle complexity can make regular encounters last 30-40 minutes, which is annoying. I want to progress in the story and not have to spend my time in battle all the time. Plus the sub-par voice acting begins to loose its appeal, along with the uninspired story. overall <font color="red">3 out of 5</font></p><p>the next 3 games are all developed by famed cult favorite Treasure.</p><p><b>Sin and Punishment</b> - Import Nintendo 64 - Rail Shooter</p><p>Sin and Punishment is considered one of their best games ever created, however it couldn't have been made on a worse console. I can't play this game. it's just a horrible presentation. if the revolution can play this game with crisp graphics and a controller that features naturally gameplay, i'll be able to give it a better review. but i cannot control the character with my thumb and press the Z button to fire at the same time. um.. come to think of it, i could change the controls (at least i think i can).. hrmm.. maybe i'll do that and try again. nothing can save the blurry 15 fps, though. at the moment <font color="red">2 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Stretch Panic</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Platformer</p><p>as i was sifting through games in the cheapy bin at wal*mart i found this little game. a treasure game for $15? .. sign me up. Stetch Panic is pretty interesting and quite unique. you control the character with the left stick and with the right stick, you control stretch, a shadow light hand which grabs parts of enemies and the enviroment. it's a unique concept but you need to have a game to compliment your game engine. all you do is walk around stretching and snapping enemies with no idea why your shadow can stretch things, nor what you're doing defeating these big breasts enemies. what the hell? <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Astro Boy</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Action</p><p>Treasure has been disappointing so far. although both the previous titles have their good attributes in other genres, Treasure excels at side-scrollers and shooters. the 2D monolith and Astro Boy is gloriously 2D. Astro Boy features a variety of different attacks you can use on your enemies like punching, kicking, and finger laser. punching is your basic attack, while kicking will topple enemies into each other. the laser will pierce enemies hitting a whole row of baddies. As you progress through the game you can power up aspects of Astro Boy to be more offensive, defensive, or aware of secrets. It's $20 well spent for your gameboy advance library. sometimes the play control of the gameboy gets a little awkward. i could probably have a better time with the game on a gameboy player <font color="red">4 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Contra Shattered Soldier</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Action Shooter</p><p>As mentioned in the deal thread, i picked up a copy of Contra Shattered Solider for pretty cheap. This game is fricken tough. Jesse and Zach don't lie. You have 3 lives to clear a level, during which they are thousands of way to die by accident. and overall you have 3 or 4 continues that which to beat the entire game. i have no idea how many levels there are. this game takes a bit of time to learn and master, but it's all very systematic. enemies and obstacles all appear in the same spots each time, so eventually knowledge can master Contra. but it's an intense ride. and the game has a story too. (very little of which i have been able to see, as i have only been able to beat the first level). overall <font color="red">3.5 out of 5</font></p><p>Lately i've been playing a lot of shooters. I've bought a couple and also played a couple arcade roms as well. in particular, one series that is very good is Vasara.</p><p><b>Vasara</b> - Arcade - Vertical Shooter</p><p>The story of Vasara is set in the Waring States Period of Japan as Nobunaga has begun has conquest/uniting. you take control of one of 3 characters to battle the armies of Nobunaga. stage by stage you destroy his forces and in the final showdown fight Nobunaga himself. the gameplay is quite solid, as it provides difficult and unique arrays of bullets, while having the perfect sized hit box to dodge them with. The main controls are fire and bomb. you can hold down the fire button to charge a slash attack which deflect bullets. Throughout the level, when you kill enemies your Vasara bar fills. When it's full your normal charge slash becomes a Vasara slash, which is about 3 times your nomral shot. 3 times the size, the power, and the duration. it's what you use against the boss ^_^.</p><p>On top of that, the added challenge is to kill named soliders of the war. These soldiers are usually regular enemies in yellow, mini-bosses and regular bosses. Probably names of actual samurai from the past. Each level has 20 regular samurai, plus 3 for the miniboss and boss.</p><p>overall, Vasara is quite challenging and has more to it than just shooting down everything, although that helps too. <font color="red">4 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Vasara 2</b> - Arcade - Vertical Shooter</p><p>Vasara was pretty unique and fun, and Vasara 2 actually adds to the experience with more options and added more challenging level of difficulty. you can choose normal or hard. Normal is about as challenging as the first game, whereas Hard steps it up a notch with twice as many levels, more bullets, and tougher bullets.</p><p>Vasara 2 refines the named Samurai system as well. Everything level has exactly 20 regular samurai, 4 mini-bosses and 1 boss, so you actually know what you need to kill.</p><p>Vasara 2 also expands on the Vasara system. You can now stock up to 3 Vasara, and then use the bomb button to activate them, rather than your regular charge shot. This makes normal really easy because you'll always have one ready to take out a mini-boss when you encounter one, rather than taking an entire level to charge up one and only one Vasara.</p><p>Vasara 2 is a beatiful sequel, and i play it much more than the original, even though the were released less than a year apart. I guess the developers really wanted do more with Vasara after they released the first one, and then quickly refined it ^_^. <font color="red">4.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Mars Matrix</b> - Domestic Dreamcast - Vertical Shooter</p><p>Another shooter i've gotten into is Mars Matrix by the good folks at Capcom. Mars Matrix is pretty intense. tons of enemies, tons of bullets. much like Vasara, your charge shot deflects bullets, which is extremely useful in many cases. Enemies attacks have a good variety of random and structured shots. Bosses can be predictable, but most enemies will sometimes throw you for a loop and have you dodging constantly to the point you are amazed you didn't die ^_^. i love hitboxes.</p><p>Mars Matrix has the added system of experience. everything you kill drops a golden cube and when you reach certain amounts your attack becomes more powerful. this has you running after golden cubes, while dodging bullets and shooting down enemies. you are always moving around, and always have you keep track of bullets. it's pretty intense ^_^</p><p>Near the end of the Dreamcast's short life, It was released over here in the states and was pretty hard to track down for a decent price. thank god for game crazy. overall <font color="red">4.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Zelda: Oracle of Seasons</b> - Domestic Gameboy Color - Adventure</p><p>After completing Castlevania, i wanted some more gmaeboy games to dive into. Zelda Minish Cap is on the list, but i don't want to pay $30 and i hadn't played Oracle yet, so i decided to spend $10 at my local gamestore and purchased the red version of the game.</p><p>It's pretty good, though still restricted when compared with A Link to the Past. Oracle of Seasons is quite linear, but it hides itself well. it takes a little bit to figure exactly what to do and where to go. It's pretty solid, but not very ground breaking. maybe if i start playing the blue version, something interesting will come out of it. <font color="red">3.5 out of 5</font></p><p>______________________</p><p>so this is where i'm at for the moment. I'm currently in level 7 of Zelda battling my way through those annoying knights. After which i'll be down 12 games so far this summer with a number of others on my plate. After Zelda i'll probably start playing Metroid Zero Mission on the gameboy, and then maybe start in with Shadow Hearts.</p><p>Though there are plenty of games i want to play too. like Metal Gear Ghost Babel for the gameboy color, Zelda Minish Cap on the gba, Mekai Kingdom coming out in about a month, In the Groove which comes out by the end of the week, Metal Slug Advance on gba, and maybe even Metroid Fusion if i like Zero Mission.</p><p>what games has everyone else been playing lately? .. any good ones? post your thoughts ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Magic Knight Rayearth impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/magic-knight-rayearth-impressions">Magic Knight Rayearth impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The saturn had died..</p><p>but towards the end of the year, after Xenosaga and Metal Gear Solid came out for the playstation, speciality gaming store like Electronic Boutique and Funcoland (at the time) received very few copies of Magic Knight Rayearth as a new release, after the saturn's death. i think i remember a few people talking about some game that came out for the saturn at EB, but Toys R us never got a copy for me to take a look at.</p><p>skip ahead 6 years to last christmas break. i found a pretty good deal on ebay for Magic Knight Rayearth, so i picked it up. Then I learned that my saturn was missing it's a/v cable, and i also lost all my saturn controllers as well.. so over the course of the previous semester i had been putting it back together, so to speak. i got a saturn controller from eau claire during no brand con, and then a found a saturn a/v cable online when surfing around.</p><p>with my saturn complete, i arrived home last week, and started to play.</p><div class='title'><b>Impressions...</b></div><p>like most Working Designs game, it's chalk full of voice acting, and anime cutscenes. It took about an hour into the game, until i was actually able to walk around and do some fighting. overall, the game is quite dissapointing.. i suppose that's why i never really heard anything about it after it first came out.</p><p>The game plays just like the old 16-bit Zelda. You have your overhead view of your characters, and then you slash at enemies to kill them. You have 3 characters that you can switch back and forth to and from at will.</p><p>There's Hikaru whose magic element is fire. even though she's kind of the leader, i think she's the weakest one of them all. her slash is generally the same as Link's slash. very close range, i usually get hit by whomever i'm trying to kill before i land an attack.</p><p>Next, there's Umi whose magic element its water/ice. She's the smart one of the group, and her attacks are more useful than hikarus. She also has a sword, but she's a fencer so she attacks forward with more range, plus she takes off more damage than hikaru.</p><p>Finally, there's Fuu. She's the calm collective bitch of the group. Her element is Wind and Healing. Her weapon is a bow and arrow, so she's best with range attacks, although they are quite weak. Her powered up shot, sends 3 homing arrows off to kill enemies. She's the most useful of the group.</p><p>After playing this game a little more and a little more, i realize just how bad it is.. I think A Link to the Past had better, more realistic sounding sound-effects than this game. Plus, when there are more than 15 or 16 sprites on the screen at once, the saturn lags. thats terrible. especially when there's a version of this game on the super nintendo that probably runs seemless.</p><p>plus i get so bored, running around doing meanille tasks, that i just can't play it for hours on end. i usually switch to tv, or go outside for a little while before coming back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So.. Overall, Magic Knight Rayearth isn't all that great. I have no idea why it is so rare, but i'm glad i didn't pay the $120 most people ask for it online. if you are a die hand Magic Knight or CLAMP fan that most see everything there is, then i suggest you rent it.. (and by rent it, i mean check out the snes rom)</p><p>Next...</p><p>i may have my saturn working, but it still doesn't save games. once i fix the memory problem, i'll start playing Panzer Dragoon Saga again, unless i get suckered into buying/playing Eternal Mana or Stella Dues.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anime Video Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anime-video-games">Anime Video Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

(at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/76">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/74">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
