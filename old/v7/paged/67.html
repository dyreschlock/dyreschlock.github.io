One day, when shopping at the dinner discount grocery store, i came across some spaghetti noodles.  Oh baby, i hadn't had spaghetti in such a long time.  That's what's for dinner tonight!  I picked up a couple boxes, some spices, and went on my merry way.</p><p>At home though, all i had was a frying pan.  I didn't have a strainer or a big 'ol or any of the usual instruments.  My frying pan was kinda deep, so i figured i could just use that and then drain out the water somehow.  I started frying up the noodles and something amazing happened.  All the water in teh pan either boiled off or was absorbed by the noodles..  All that was left in the pan were the noodles, and i used this opportunity to fry them a little bit for the ultimate taste.  I chucked some cheese on them at the same time, and it was the most delicious spaghetti i had ever tasted..</p><p>Once i got back and started cooking again, and sought to perfect this recipe..  Although it's not quite perfect, i think i'm done eating this fatty spaghetti recipe..  i've gained about 15 lbs. in the past 2 months :/  blech.  That's also because i sit down all day now and then watch tv at night.</p><p>Anywho..  on with the recipe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07480.webp" /></p><p>here's the ingredients i've been using: some spaghetti noodles, olive oil, a bag of lettuce, some shredded cheese, parmesan cheese, delicious spaghetti sauce, delicious alfredo sauce, and some spices such as garlic and organo.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070307_spaghetti/DSC07482.webp" /></p><p class='img'>Start off by putting some Olive oil in the pan.

I filled out all the fields with random characters to see if i could get with that, but no..  I went through the code to check out the validation and there are 3 things that must be true in order for a Credit Card to be valid before it even considers processing.  One of these things was just that it wasn't expired, but the other 2 dealt with the number itself.</p><p>Since i was inputting a VISA card, the number had to follow a few conventions.  It had to be either 13 or 16 digits long, and had to start with a 4.  Our processing software has a bunch of other card types as well, each with their own conventions specifying the length of the number, and the first couple digits prefixing the number.</p><p>The real interesting requirement was the number had to follow the Luhn Formula, which i later looked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">wikipedia</a>.  The Luhn Formula states that when you double every other number starting from the end up the digit sequence and then add all the digits together, their sum is divisible by 10.</p><p>So...</p><p>If you have a some random number sequence: a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6</p><p>Double every other digit starting from the back: 2(a1) a2 2(a3) a4 2(a5) a6</p><p>Add them all together:  2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6</p><p>They should be divisble by 10:  (2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6) % 10 = 0 (formula 1)</p><p>Moving some things around we'd get this formula if the number of digits are even: ( 2(a(1..n odd)) + a(2..n even) ) % 10 = 0</p><p>So....  this is how i needed to derive my fake Visa number to continue along the ordering process.  I began using the conventions defined with the card type, so that gave me this template: 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.</p><p>Since we take every other digits, let's split up the variables a little bit: 4xyx yxyx yxyx yxyx.</p><p>Plugging this number into our formula, gives us ( 2(4 + 7y) + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 8 + 14y + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 4 + 7y + 4x ) % 5 = 0 (formula 2)</p><p>That 7 is rather annoying, but we've already hit prime with the 5, so you can't really reduce it much further.  Luckily it's in a cute little formula that we could just plug in numbers to find something simple..  This is, of course, if we wanted all x to be the same and all y to be the same.  Otherwise formula 2 would be formula 1.</p><p>Anywho.. looking at formula 2 for a few seconds may give you an answer.  if y = 1 and x = 1, it succeeds.  I've got my fake Visa number 4111 1111 1111 1111, but you could go the easy route and have y = 0 and find x = 4, or x = 0 and find y = 3.</p><p>I suppose it would've been easily if i kept my number as 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.  Then i would've found ( 4 + 11x ) % 5 = 0, and found x = 1 very quickly..  or that i could use x = 6 too.</p><p>After looking into this stuff, i've realized just how insecure this whole system is. It's pretty easy to make up a fake Visa number, but taking a look at that wikipedia article, the Luhn Formula is not meant for encryption, just validation.  Just a little housekeeping, so someone doesn't screw up and type a 5 rather than a 6 and still get a valid number.  This is used for all credit card numbers too, so if you're bored why not double check your Visa number to see if its valid.</p><p>Math is everywhere ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-3">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p><b>Java 6 Features</b> w/ Venkat Subranium</p><p>On this third day of christmas I started of in Venkat's Java 6 features talk, which was rather enlightening.  He talked about how Java 6 has integrated the use of scripting languages into the java language and how scripting languages can use the java libraries on their own.  You can also pull in script files into your java code, run them, and play around with the results of the run code.</p><p>Something that peeked my curiosity a little more was the next feature he talked about: instantiated an instance of the compiler and being able to compile and run new code at runtime.  That's freakin' awesome.  You could do some pretty fun AI functionality by setting up some program that would write, compile and run code all on its own.  I think about having just a simple Body class sitting on a server somewhere.  It doesn't have much... just one method that takes in a filepath.  I'll send that sucker an Arm class..  The body reads and runs that Arm class and instantly makes it its own.  Pretty handy.</p><p>Eventually if you quite giving more intelligent body parts it might be able to start writing up code for making its own limbs and the code monster keeps growing...  Then the terminator would come back through time to kill me.</p><p><b>Advanced Selenium</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>Anywho...  the next panel I went to was Selenium which was also pretty slick.  Even though we use Selenium at work, i never really knew what it was about.  I thought it was just some JavaScript testing tool...  but i guess i got that backwards.  Selenium is a testing tool written in JavaScript.  You can, or write Java code to, fill out table information representing actions taken to traverse your website.  Stuff like..  fill in User text field with 'NameString', click on login, click on this and that, buy this, logout, all the while sticking in several asserts to make sure your system is doing what you want.</p><p>This is a fantastic way to test your webframe work.  Just input all your Use cases into Selenium, hit play, and it'll return all the infractions of your Use cases for you.  Huzzah..  No need to run through everything on your own.</p><p>You could also setup Selenium to run a bunch of macros that will get your within your system quicker..</p><p><b>Expert Panel</b> @ Lunch</p><p>After lunch was the expert panel discussion, which had 8 or 9 speakers take questions from the crowd.  The question of 'how should students be taught programming basics and lore when there are so many modern day languages and tools that remove the need to explicitly know about them?' was posed.  Problems are posed when teaching students only Java as language, because then they know nothing of garbage collection and memory leaks.  Problems are posed when teaching students a loosely typed language, because then type know nothing of type casting and such.  Where do teachers begin the learning process, yet still get them up to speed with the technologies of today.</p><p>Everyone on the panel said their peace about their thoughts..  Certainly, the consensus was don't tie them down to one language and CERTAINLY don't tie them down to one platform.  No one language is infinite.  One quote from the weekend was, "Don't think of software as gold bars sitting in a vault..  Software is more like lettuce.  If you let it sit, it will degrade and rot away.. "  This is true with all technologies in this field.  You have to keep current to be a valued member of this industry or else you'll be structurally unemployed sooner than you think.</p><p>This really extends further to almost all industries..  All industries evolve..</p><p>As an addendum, they added, that that's not to say forget about the past..  You don't need to know how to write code at the byte code level, but you should definitely know how that byte level code is used.  You should know the inner workings of the constructs you are building on.  Computers aren't MAGIC..  they are technological devices built on technologies built on technologies..  If you don't know how the technologies you are using as a foundation, then you have no business building on them.</p><p>Another topic brought up during this time was open source technologies with the slogan, "get your ass out there and help out"  Open source communities are the main driver's for developing these technologies, not just creators of the technologies..  The communities are the ones that pick up the left over parts, fix bugs and clean up the code which shapes and completes the projects..  Even if you needed a selfish reason to work on something, think of the scenario of coming into a job interview and being able to say that you worked on that open source technology that that company is currently using.  Dump that on your resume.</p><p><b>Reflection</b> w/ Ted</p><p>After such stirring lunch conversation, the sessions started up again.  I attended Ted ___'s guide to reflection.  Reflection is basically making an object that is the representation of a class.  This object has all the methods and fields, but this is not an instantiation of the class itself.  With reflection you can actual get to private data and methods..  Which is handy in some instances..</p><p>This is also how annotations are utilized.  When you grab the class, you can get the annotations from that class and process that information.  huzzah.  This was a repeat of Venkat's annotation talk the previous morning.</p><p><b>10 Ways to Improve your code</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>stuff to come...<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-2">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This whole conference seems to be very Jave development oriented and  showcases several brilliant developers of Java and Java-like technologies.  There is also a huge focus on thw web services side of Java development,  which makes this conference right up my own alley, as well as, Widen's alley.</p><p>It's pretty much like any convention except the people speaking are actual experts rather than amatuer fans of the product.  Case in point, the three speakers I attended today were actually developers of the framework they showcased.  David Gaery showcased JSF, Venkat Subramaniam showcased Grails, and Scott Davis showcased Atom, though Davis isn't really responsible for Atom.  It is really amazing to listen to these heavyweights of the Java community talk about their passion.</p><p>Atom certainly caught my eye today, but what i'm really shopping around for is a web framework I can use and implement for theschlock.com.</p><p>JSF was kinda fun, but it felt rather heavy duty for what I wish to accomplish.  Grails is simply amazing, but it seemed difficult to customize.</p><p>What I want to do with theschlock.com is quite simply.  I want to make it a navigatable portfolio of all my old art and other random crations i've had over the years.  An end all resource of all the crap I've done.</p><p>I want to use one of these crazy new technologies because it'll give me the experience of playing around with something new and cool, as well as demonstrate my proficency of applying said technology.</p><p>After thinking about a few things though: what I want to do is quite simply.  A ton of entries sorted by date and possibly by category.  This is easily accomplished using technologies i've been using for the past couple of years.  Hell, just build a javascript 'database' type file and have page javascript load and render all those elements and huzzah..  i've got my website.  :shrugs: I guess I could do it that way.  why make things more complicated then they have to be.</p><p>Maybe i'll just search for a technology to develop a beautiful photo navigator for all the 15,000 pictures i've taken over these last four years.</p><p>Anyways, Grails is pretty amazing.  I wouldn't mind playing around with that.  Much like its' initial model: rails, it utilizes Convention over Configuration, which means you do everything a specific way rather than write up a bunch of config files to tell he framework what the hell you are doing.  This type of framework lends itself extremely well to Agile development, since you can write code fast, rather than spending time configuring everything.</p><p>The highlight of the evening was Scott Davis' keynote speach, which confronted the question of choice...  basically.</p><p>ugh...  I'm typing this up on my phone and getting rather bored.  i'll finish this up later.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Vista work around" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/vista-work-around">Vista work around</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday we watched one of my favorite movies..  <b>War of the Worlds</b>.  Man i love this movie.  That 2005 Friday evening was a very magic evening.  Nature truly applauded the release with a lightning storm of its own.  That summer i went to the theaters a total of 3 times to see it.  Later on, i downloaded it from the internet and watched it quite a bit more.</p><p>I hadn't seen it in a while, so i needed my fix.  War of the Worlds falls into the same category as other great films like Matrix Reloaded, where the movie itself is very shallow.  It won't win any awards, but there are many aspects of the movie that are rich in substance.</p><p>I really seem to like these movies.  They appeal to my manic adrenaline side, but still offer more than that outside of the film.  I think that's why i don't really like Crank all that much.  There's really nothing there..</p><p>One of the things i noticed about War of the Worlds were the death machine designs compared to the alien design.  The aliens themselves, are 3 legged creatures with 3 fingers on each hand.  They can also walk on walls, which suggests the tip of their fingers have suction cups or something like that.  Their torso's are quite small compared to their leg span.  They have tiny little arms, and their heads fan out kinda like a spoiler.</p><p>The death machines can be described in the exact same way.  3-legged machines with tiny bodies.  Small little arm instruments on that body with a fanned out head..  So these alien death machines are actually alien mecha, machines built in their creator's own image.  Much like how anime such as Gundam model their massive machine after the human body.  It interesting to see a alien race so bent on vengence and rage would adopt one of our most arrogant traits.  It's quite... human.</p><p>When i was in Japan, #five and i got onto this subject somehow and he was telling me about an article some guy wrote about the movie.  It dealt with the time periods in which these movies were made.  For the original War of the Worlds books and movies, it was always about the aliens coming to air.  Flying their air ships from the sky, and zapping all the humans.  All those remakes came at a time when war was waged between countries.  The threat was always external.  Fear of invasion.</p><p>In the new War of the Worlds, the aliens were always here.  Underneath us..  biding their time.  They didn't come from the outside.  This parallels the wars that are waged today.  The war with terrorism.  The threat isn't external: it is internal.</p><p>This really makes the 2005 War of the Worlds an <em>adaption</em>, not a remake. ^_^</p><p>____</p><p>Anywho, this movie is all manor of kick ass, so if you haven't seen it you must.  I was rather surprised that one of my roommates hadn't even heard of it..  That was actually the real reason behind watching it.</p><p>A while ago, i developed the War of the Worlds drinking game which is both simple and works quite well.  All you have to do is take a drink when:</p><p>1) Someone asks an unanswered question.</p><p>That's it.  It worked quite well on Niehaus the first night he decided to drink.  I've got pictures hidden around this site if you're interested ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shining" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shining">Shining</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>As indicated by the previous articles, a couple of weeks ago i purchased a Wii.  A thread on Cheap Ass Gamer stated that Wal*mart was holding on their shipment of Wii to be released on that coming Sunday.  So, that sunday, i woke up at stupid o'clock in the morning, put on my jacket and drove over to Wal*mart.  It was only 5 minutes away from my house anyways.</p><p>I got their 15 minutes before they opened, and received the number 17 to indicate my place in line.  Apparently, this was more well known than i thought.  They had plenty of Wii machines to go around, though.  I got home and went back to bed for a little while.  Later on that day, we hooked it up and started messing around with Wii Sports, but got bored of it.  I wanted something fun to play that took advantage of the Wii-mote's capabilities.</p><p>I went out and picked up Trauma Center as my first Wii title.  I thought this was rather nostalgic since Trauma Center was also the first title i purchased for my DS.  I got home, put it in, and started to play.</p><p>For some reason, i thought this was a brand new game.  Since the full title of the game is "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", i thought that meant this was Trauma Center 2.  They couldn't really make a sequel of Trauma Center DS, but they could've had more doctors in other parts of the Trauma Center universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trauma Center Wii is a port of the DS title.  The story, characters and surgeries are the same fun missions you tackled on the portable venue.  How disappointing..</p><p>They did add another character at the last minute.  When you complete a story arc, you unlock another story with another character.  These missions take full advantage of the Wii controller.  In the first mission, you twist the Wii-mote to place a shattered broken bone back together.</p><p>On its' own, Trauma Center really starves the player.  The gameplay really lends itself to an Arcade setting, but the bulk of time spent in game is reading character dialogue.  The player sits through boring text until they finally get to experience the action and fast-paced setting of the surgery gameplay.  As far as i know, you can't skip this dialogue..  i should look into that.  Unfortunately, if they removed all story and just had a bunch of surgeries, the game wouldn't have any depth.</p><p>The gameplay is where Trauma Center really shines.  You have several different tools that you switch back and forth through while performing the surgery as outlined in the dialogue.</p><p>I'm not really sure which version of Trauma Center i prefer.  In the DS version, you have the extra precision of pinpoint pen strokes on the touch screen, but with the Wii version you have the speed and agility of an extra controller to switch between instruments.</p><p>There are other little differences as well.  On the Wii version, you actually use the defibrillators rather than the nurse automatically doing it for you.  Using the healing touch i've found to be much more difficult, but i think i just need to get used to the timing.</p><p>Anywho, i do love Trauma Center, but there are many downfalls that make it difficult to recommend to people.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-3">Twilight Princess (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This weekend, i finally came across Twilight Princess on the Wii for a cheapy price tag, so i picked it up.  Thinking back, i'm not really sure why.  In the past two months i've started 6 games that i have not finished.  These games would be Portrait of Ruin on DS, Final Fantasy XII on PS2, Cooking Mama on DS, Hotel Dusk on DS, Trauma Center on Wii, and Picross DS on DS.  I've been playing Picross quite a bit, but the other games are becoming lost causes..  Starting ANOTHER game would be foolish right?</p><p>Whatever..  i want a fun Wii game that i can sink time into.  I like the Wii quite a bit, but i'm stuck in Trauma Center, and Wii Sports and Wii Play don't really hold my interest.  The only other game i play quite a bit on my Wii is Gunstar Heroes, but i'm getting my assed kicked on Level 5.</p><p>Anyways..  i bought Wii Twilight Princess and started playing it yesterday.  There's a pretty stunning difference between the gamecube version and the wii version of the game, which everyone already knows about.  Traditionally Link is a left-handed sword wielder, but the vast majority of earth's population are right-handed sword wielders.  Rather than re-code Link's physics or model, they decided to mirror the entire game.  In other words, Right is Left and Left is Right.  Now link is right-handed... i guess.</p><p>I didn't think this would really bother me at all, but i find myself getting lost every now and then when i'm trying to find a house or navigate throughout the world.  Dungeons are pretty easy though, since i hadn't spent nearly the amount of time i have in villages or the world overall.</p><p>The obvious difference is most certainly the controls.  I'm not a big fan of the Wii controls.  Aiming with the slingshot, boomerang, etc is FAR better with the Wii-mote, but sword play is way too flexible.  On Gamecube Twilight Princess, you just hit the B button to slash and beat up things, but on the Wii you swing the Wii-mote back and forth motion which loses a lot of precision.  It's far worse than using an analog PS2 controller for a fighter..  The jousting event took me about half an hour to finally figure out when the sword actually swings when i jerk the Wii-mote to the side.  With the Gamecube controller, you hit the button and Link swings the sword right then.  Precision is key when you come to events based on timing and the Wii-mote doesn't offer that type of precision.  I eventually figured it out, though ^_^</p><p>The other thing that annoys me is the lack of camera views in the Wii version.  On the Gamecube controller the C-button left and right would move the camera left and right.  The C-button up and down would pull and push the camera away from and towards Link.  Unless i'm missing it, there is no camera movement in the Wii version at all.  I've been using the Z button to correct the camera's placement.</p><p>They should've used the D-pad for the view changing, but ended up using that to store weapons.  In this way, Link can have 4 total weapons out at once rather than 3 in the Gamecube version.  The Wii controller is a little disadvantage for button mapping though.  Both controllers have 8 buttons, an analog stick and a D-pad, but the Wii controller lacks that C-button stick on the Gamecube controller.  So, rather than code around this problem, it seems that they just omitted camera controls from the game.</p><p>Unless i'm missing something..  I'm probably missing something..  maybe you can do Camera control with the B button on the Wii.  I dunno..  i'll try that out tonight.  oh wait...  B button is for items..  i shall consult the instruction manual.</p><p>Anyways, I still prefer the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess for a few reasons.  1) It was designed and developed to take advantage of the Gamecube, whereas the Wii is just a port.  The whole mirrored world thing is pure proof of that, which removes the traditional left-handed Link.  2) The sword swinging feels too loose, and lacks the precision that a simple button push provides on the Gamecube.  and 3) I'm probably bias towards the Gamecube version because i played through it before the Wii version.</p><p>I dunno.  I think that if i had played the Wii version first, i probably would've liked the feel of the controller better, but be annoyed about the aiming schema. :shrugs:  I guess we'll see what happens...  It's still the great amazing game you must play if you own a Gamecube or a Wii.  Quite possibly the BEST gamecube game ever made. ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/68">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/66">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
