With only a few weeks before I move across town, laying down on the floor, tip-typing away no longer appeals to me all that much.  Something had to be done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  now i can say to myself, "no matter what happens, i've got that desk situation under control.  it's taken care of.  i'm done.  complete."</p><p>It's amazing how an elevated flat surface can add so much order, harmony and cleanliness to a room.  Luckily, if i still want to use a computer like a hobo, i've got my handy laptop fixed.</p><p>The whole black and white theme could be quite attractive, but several pieces on my desk need repairment to promote it.  Some new white computer speakers would be rad, and possible a new mouse too.  I've had those computer speakers for nearly 8 years.  I guess they'll just be another computer hand-me-down for my parents.</p><p>Thanks go out to Erika and Stephen for helping me bring this desk all the way from Chicago back to Madison.  I'm not too sure if my crappy car would have been sufficient transport.</p><p>While in Chicago yesterday, we made the mandatory stop at Mitsuwa.  I had never appreciated that place as much as i do now.  It's the midwest's little piece of Japan.  The stores are squished together like in Japan, the employees are polite like in Japan (though, they speak english to us westerners :/), and everything is in Japanese (w/ plenty of subtitles).  It's really the most Japanese i've been immersed in since returning to that states.  I love walking up to a restaurant and being able to read the menu.  ã?«ã??ä¸¼, ã¶ã£ã?ã?ã?ã©ã??, é³¥ã?«ã?¬ã?ã©ã??.  ^_^</p><p>I purchased several items in bulk, and called it a day.  There were plenty of kids from Anime Central hanging out as well.  Unfortunately, ACen neglected to have a saturday only pass available for purchase, or else i may have thought of considering going for a few hours.</p><p>Shade.</p><p>Wheeewww.  Desk!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Questing for Bugs" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/questing-for-bugs">Questing for Bugs</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

When i don't have anything particular to work on, I'll log into our bug tracking software. This has a list of all bugs and cases that people are and aren't working on. I sort for unassigned cases, and then assign it to myself. This is pretty much like any bulletin board you'll find around anywhere, especially in an old medieval town, usually on the back wall of a tavern. "Search for a Dragon", "Provide safe passage across the Bog of Sorrow", "Fix order processing", "This image doesn't show up in IE".. ya know. Daily Quests.</p><p>Once i pick up my quest, it's time to journey into the wilderness. The dark forest which contains complex webs of Java code. I delve deeper into the darkness, running over what happened to the contractor when he was doing the same thing. Finding the problem, developing a strategy/solution, and going through with it. I'm sure i could come up with a clever analogy if i thought about it.</p><p>Success. The quest has been complete, back to town to report my success. As, i return to town, I sync up my code base to be completely current with events and things that have happened while i was away. I didn't get any emails about Build Errors, so it appears the town was safe while i was away. I reach the gates of the inner city, and run my JUnit test suite, just to make sure the results of my quest don't infect and harm my fair town.</p><p>Crap. It appears by slaying this particular dragon, I have violated this one test that says there are only 7 of these left in the world. Now that there are 6, it fails. Well... i'll just rewrite that test to indicate 6.</p><p>Success again. The tests are green, and i'm good to go. I reach the tavern inside the city and lay down my solution on the bar counter, committing these changes to the repository. The commit message indicates which Quest this dead dragon is for.</p><p>And I'm set to go. Another job well done, and time to look for a new quest. Occasionally I'll get handed down an official assignment from city officials, like a feature request or refactor.</p><p>Abstraction is key to developing any application.. though, sometimes it helps to keep things a little more grounded.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Use the Google" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/use-the-google">Use the Google</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 8, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My life revolves around Google quite a bit lately.  Whenever I open up a browser, I'm in my own little Googlized world.  My personalized homepage is complete with the current weather outside, quick submit links for ebay and wikipedia, quick links various websites, news feed from digg.com, and the Gmail gadget and Google Reader gadget.  When Firefox opens up, i've automatically checked my mail and all my RSS feeds.  It's pretty handy when you don't want extra programs running in the background.</p><p>Thanks to Google Reader, I now know that kotaku.com is FAR faster at getting video games news to the Internets than Jostiq.com, most of the time.</p><p>My personalized homepage is also pimpin' with the Japanese fox theme, even though i'm pretty sick of it now.  Google is also pretty handy on my phone, when I'm not at work or home.  My personalized homepage is just as easy to access, so i can still get my mail and my news.  Google Maps is pretty slick on my phone, too.</p><p>Speaking of which, Google Maps made some pretty slick upgrades recently.  Besides new Satellite photos, you can save your own 'maps' and easily import and export from Google Earth.   I made a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1"> quick map of points</a> that those studying abroad might be interested in knowing ahead of time.  Just a couple basic areas.  I'll probably make another map that works with my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">Games List</a> a little better than my current solution.  These maps can be saved as a KML file, which loads directly into Google Earth.</p><p>If you haven't played around with Google Earth, it's free for download.  Just go to <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="http://earth.google.com/">earth.google.com</a>.  Google Earth is a 3 dimensional atlas of the world.  You start up far above the earth, and can zoom into anywhere you'd like.  The surface of the earth is skinned with the same Satellite images from Google Maps and works similarly.  When you get closer to the ground, the details of Earth become more clear..  The satellite images are high enough quality most of the time that you can see buildings, cars, and houses quite distinctly, just like Google Maps.</p><p>However, Google Earth can do far more than that.  Google Earth also renders terrain and buildings in 3D.  You can tilt the view to get a good grasp of what the area actually looks like.  Here's the Nagasaki area:</p><p>Google Earth streams all these images and information in real time, so it takes up very little space on you computer.  Though, it does load all its' cache into memory, which doesn't make it very light weight.</p><p>Google Earth also has links to Wikipedia, Google Earth communities, and  Panoramio: a community photograph repository.  People from around the world, can upload their photos and input coordinates on where their picture was taken.  Each month, Google grabs all the new information from Panoramio and hooks it into Google Earth.</p><p>Yesterday, i finally decided to make my own Panoramio account and start uploading photos.  I went through pictures #10000 through #17000 on my camera.  Basically, the time i was in Japan and the summer before hand.</p><p>Here's my account: http://www.panoramio.com/user/449013<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost - Purgatory" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-purgatory">Lost - Purgatory</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><em>Lost Spoilers ahead</em></p><p>Last night's episode of Lost put a solid structure on one of those internet theories about the Island.  This theory states pretty much exactly what has been said in the last two episodes that "all the 'survivors' of 815 actually died in the crash and the island is Purgatory."  Naomi confirms this by saying that in the real world they found Oceanic flight 815 at the bottom of the ocean, in tact, with all passengers in tact and very dead.  Locke's father also says the same thing.</p><p>Lets examine everyone else's back story of how they got to the island.  Naomi's helicopter just crashed in the sea, Desmond was thrown overboard in a violent storm, Juliet drank some unknown substance given to her, Locke's father was smashed into a median, Danielle's research ship crashed on the island.  Perhaps they did all die, and this is the gateway to the afterlife.  Perhaps their actions on this island will determine where they spend enternity.  The island follows a similar construct to life, but with a few changes.  If you die on the island, do you go to hell or heaven?  Is the island itself Heaven, considering the others are a group of "good" people.  Since Ben is their leader, does that make him God, or Jesus?  Or is the Island hell, as Locke's father puts it, which would make Ben Satan or some devil?</p><p>I guess this explains why the others kidnap certain people.  They are separate the bad ones from the good ones..  The heaven candidates from the hell candidates.</p><p>Does this make the big bad black cloud of smoke the Reaper? Does that make the sonic fence the divide between heaven and hell?<br/>The whole thing with the babies also promotes this theory.  Life cannot be conceived on the Island, because everyone is already dead.  I guess the writers believe that Life begin at conception.  This is why Claire's baby is fine, and why all the other mothers die before the baby is born.</p><p>However, this whole "island = purgatory/afterlife" debate has a couple holes in it.  What about Michael?  If this is the afterlife, where did Ben send Michael?  To be reborn?  To heaven?  Or to wake up from purgatory back in the real world?  What about Ethan?  If he can leave the island to the real world and recruit people like Juliet, what does that make him?  An angel?</p><p>How do the numbers play into this theory?</p><p>The end of the season should be interesting.. even though this concept is very Twilight Zone-esq.  The really hasn't been a lot of build up, but it seems like the other's incoming attack on the survivor's camp with be the climax.

A gigantic pile of stuff that i own, but don't really want to deal with.  I like owning things.</p><p>One thing that was incredibly liberating about living in Japan for a while was my absence of stuff.  I left America with a suitcase filed with clothes, a laptop, my DS and games, and a couple personal items.  In Japan, i was free of all my worldly attachments as they were back on planet America.  Liberated.  Though, it was very reassuring that i hadn't lost anything.  A world away, my huge pile of stuff still sat there.  Still mine.  There was, maybe, once or twice that i wished i had a movie of mine with me in Japan, but beyond that, it never brought me down that i didn't have my stuff.</p><p>Well, i suppose i did have my online 'Stuff' with me.  My blog, pictures, and tons of other crap.</p><p>Truthfully, i had really been doing this for years during college.  My parents house is home to my main pile of stuff, and i would leave it up in Minneapolis, as i lived down in Platteville.  Throughout that time, i would acquire some new things and every one in a while, I would add these new things to my gigantic pile of stuff in Minneapolis.  I was never in a position where i couldn't visit my stuff pile without great difficulty.</p><p>Throughout my time in Japan, i did acquire several new things.  I started growing a new pile of stuff, and forget about what i had at home.  When i got back home, all my stuff was in one place, yet again.  My game library was all together.  My books were there, comics, flyers, etc...</p><p>But how much does all this stuff weigh me down.  Why do i need issue 43 of Nintendo power?  Who do i need a Club flyer of Bad Boy Bill from 2003?  Why do i need all my CS notes from College?</p><p>These are really just piles of stuff, and the only reason i feel the need to own them is because of sentiment.  I got that issue of Nintendo Power in the mail in 1990, and used the maps inside to beat that Nintendo Game.  I got that flyer from The Quest or Vital Vinyl when i was there that Summer and probably took pictures.  I spent fruitless amounts of time copying those notes down because it was imperative for later use.  They are a part of my history, it's not necessarily that they are monetarily valuable.  It's like being the curator for my own personal library.</p><p>This stuff is primarily relics from the past, but i hold onto things for the future.  What if i or some friend wishes to play this game, or read this book, or watch this movie, or etc?  Then we can share in part of my past.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Indigo Prophecy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/indigo-prophecy">Indigo Prophecy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.  Ikaruga on Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p>... and probably some other ones too.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/68">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/66">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
