| May 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, was the ending of Heroes Vol. 1 and I'm not really sure how i feel about the ending.</p><p>One can't simply watch Heroes and not compare it to Lost, being it the other prime time networked Sci-Fi show.  Lost does a lot of things that really keep me watching, but others constantly complain about.  Lost is all about compounding mystery and never really giving the audience any specific closure.  The writers allow the audience to build up theories and speculate about the show's direction, so the mystery will always be there.  Specifically with the way they end a Season.  Each season constantly builds up to a massive climax where the audience isn't given enough information to solve a mystery, but ends in such a way where the first 4 or 5 episodes of the next season undoubtedly will.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b><br/>For example, at the end of Season 1, no mystery was really solved, but there was closure on the current events.  Sayid and Charlie dispelled the Other's incoming attack, while Jack, Locke, Kate, and Hurley blew open the Hatch and while Sawyer, Jin and Michael were blown into the Ocean.  The biggest mystery of Season 1 became the main focus of Season 2: The Hatch.  The first 3 or 4 episodes finally gave the audience what they wanted throughout Season 1 and the rest of the Season compounded the mystery.</em></p><p><em>The same happened with the end of Season 2.  Well, i suppose one very large mystery was solved at that time: "What would happen if the counter went past 0?"  Also, we learned why/how the plane crashed on the Island.  Season 2 was kinda at odds with itself, since it juggled two mysteries at once.  The ending of season 2 gave closure to Hatch, while climaxing on the Others.  I suppose another mystery solved was the identity of Henry Gale.</em></p><p><em>Anyways, the point is that the Season 2 ender setup Season 3 to give the audience what the wanted with the Others.  Even though, they spread out the answers across the entire Season.</em></p><p><em>The same will true with tomorrow night's Season 3 finale.  All current events will be resolved, and a 'larger' mystery will show itself to be the focus of Season 4.  What could it be?  I think Jacob or something involving Jacob will be the focus of Season 4, while half-way through the Season, 'The Rescue' will start showing its face and probably be the focus of Season 5, with Season 6 something to do with Dharma.</em></p><p><em>If I were to name the seasons, I would name season 1: the crash, season 2: the hatch, and season 3: the others.  perhaps season 4 will be 'the island', season 5: the rescue, and so on.</em></p><p>Anyways, the reason I bring up Lost is that the Season ender gives the audience something to look forward to.  It ends on a cliffhanger that makes the audience squirm.  Heroes did not do that last night, in my opinion.  The whole season led up to Peter and Sylar fighting and the writers gave them exactly that.  The battle to save the world and enough of the aftermath to bring the audience back down from their high.  Volume 1 is closed.</p><p>The only cliffhanger the audience was given was the first 5 minutes of Volume 2, with Hiro back in time when the eclipse happened.  That's not what i care about at the moment.  I cared about Sylar fighting Peter, and stopping the bomb..  but all that is done with now.  I can't get attached to a story element in Season 2 when i've only been given 5 minutes of it.</p><p>The ending also eluded to Sylar being alive, and I'm sure Peter is still alive as well.  If Season 2 focuses on this, it'll just be Season 1 all over again.</p><p>So, yes..  I don't really know how i feel about it, because on one hand: i was given exactly what i wanted, but on the other: now what do i look forward to.  Lost gets it in this department..  even though, so many people complain about it.</p><p>So that's how i feel about that.  I can't wait for the finale of Lost tomorrow. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>Lost will be a total of 6 Seasons with the remaining 3 seasons only 16 episodes each, as opposed to 24 episodes.  Each episode will air consecutively.</p><p>Heroes will be back with 24 episodes, and a companion 6 episode series entitled Origins.  Each episode of Origins will focus on a single New character that might be brought into the main show.</p><p>In an interview with the creator of Heroes, he states that he wanted to make the cast of each Season as independent from each other as possible.  Originally, he was planning on killing off almost all of the current cast, with only 2 or 3 continuing characters into Season 2.  Season 2 would feature an almost entirely new cast.  He changed his mind after the audience really responded to the current set of characters.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, it makes sense to give that much closure to Season 1.  Then you can begin anew.</p><p>(sorry.. i don't have sources, at the moment, for these 3 tidbits)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to This day in Starcraft" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/this-day-in-starcraft">This day in Starcraft</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I had never appreciated that place as much as i do now.  It's the midwest's little piece of Japan.  The stores are squished together like in Japan, the employees are polite like in Japan (though, they speak english to us westerners :/), and everything is in Japanese (w/ plenty of subtitles).  It's really the most Japanese i've been immersed in since returning to that states.

| May 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm starting to notice some similarities between my daily routine of fixing bugs and working on enhancement cases at work, and any general role playing game. When i don't have anything particular to work on, I'll log into our bug tracking software. This has a list of all bugs and cases that people are and aren't working on. I sort for unassigned cases, and then assign it to myself. This is pretty much like any bulletin board you'll find around anywhere, especially in an old medieval town, usually on the back wall of a tavern. "Search for a Dragon", "Provide safe passage across the Bog of Sorrow", "Fix order processing", "This image doesn't show up in IE".. ya know. Daily Quests.</p><p>Once i pick up my quest, it's time to journey into the wilderness. The dark forest which contains complex webs of Java code. I delve deeper into the darkness, running over what happened to the contractor when he was doing the same thing. Finding the problem, developing a strategy/solution, and going through with it. I'm sure i could come up with a clever analogy if i thought about it.</p><p>Success. The quest has been complete, back to town to report my success. As, i return to town, I sync up my code base to be completely current with events and things that have happened while i was away. I didn't get any emails about Build Errors, so it appears the town was safe while i was away. I reach the gates of the inner city, and run my JUnit test suite, just to make sure the results of my quest don't infect and harm my fair town.</p><p>Crap. It appears by slaying this particular dragon, I have violated this one test that says there are only 7 of these left in the world. Now that there are 6, it fails. Well... i'll just rewrite that test to indicate 6.</p><p>Success again. The tests are green, and i'm good to go. I reach the tavern inside the city and lay down my solution on the bar counter, committing these changes to the repository. The commit message indicates which Quest this dead dragon is for.</p><p>And I'm set to go. Another job well done, and time to look for a new quest. Occasionally I'll get handed down an official assignment from city officials, like a feature request or refactor.</p><p>Abstraction is key to developing any application.. though, sometimes it helps to keep things a little more grounded.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Use the Google" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/use-the-google">Use the Google</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Whenever I open up a browser, I'm in my own little Googlized world.  My personalized homepage is complete with the current weather outside, quick submit links for ebay and wikipedia, quick links various websites, news feed from digg.com, and the Gmail gadget and Google Reader gadget.  When Firefox opens up, i've automatically checked my mail and all my RSS feeds.  It's pretty handy when you don't want extra programs running in the background.</p><p>Thanks to Google Reader, I now know that kotaku.com is FAR faster at getting video games news to the Internets than Jostiq.com, most of the time.</p><p>My personalized homepage is also pimpin' with the Japanese fox theme, even though i'm pretty sick of it now.  Google is also pretty handy on my phone, when I'm not at work or home.  My personalized homepage is just as easy to access, so i can still get my mail and my news.  Google Maps is pretty slick on my phone, too.</p><p>Speaking of which, Google Maps made some pretty slick upgrades recently.  Besides new Satellite photos, you can save your own 'maps' and easily import and export from Google Earth.   I made a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1"> quick map of points</a> that those studying abroad might be interested in knowing ahead of time.  Just a couple basic areas.  I'll probably make another map that works with my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">Games List</a> a little better than my current solution.  These maps can be saved as a KML file, which loads directly into Google Earth.</p><p>If you haven't played around with Google Earth, it's free for download.  Just go to <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="http://earth.google.com/">earth.google.com</a>.  Google Earth is a 3 dimensional atlas of the world.  You start up far above the earth, and can zoom into anywhere you'd like.  The surface of the earth is skinned with the same Satellite images from Google Maps and works similarly.  When you get closer to the ground, the details of Earth become more clear..  The satellite images are high enough quality most of the time that you can see buildings, cars, and houses quite distinctly, just like Google Maps.</p><p>However, Google Earth can do far more than that.  Google Earth also renders terrain and buildings in 3D.  You can tilt the view to get a good grasp of what the area actually looks like.  Here's the Nagasaki area:</p><p>Google Earth streams all these images and information in real time, so it takes up very little space on you computer.  Though, it does load all its' cache into memory, which doesn't make it very light weight.</p><p>Google Earth also has links to Wikipedia, Google Earth communities, and  Panoramio: a community photograph repository.  People from around the world, can upload their photos and input coordinates on where their picture was taken.  Each month, Google grabs all the new information from Panoramio and hooks it into Google Earth.</p><p>Yesterday, i finally decided to make my own Panoramio account and start uploading photos.  I went through pictures #10000 through #17000 on my camera.  Basically, the time i was in Japan and the summer before hand.</p><p>Here's my account: http://www.panoramio.com/user/449013<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost - Purgatory" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-purgatory">Lost - Purgatory</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><em>Lost Spoilers ahead</em></p><p>Last night's episode of Lost put a solid structure on one of those internet theories about the Island.  This theory states pretty much exactly what has been said in the last two episodes that "all the 'survivors' of 815 actually died in the crash and the island is Purgatory."  Naomi confirms this by saying that in the real world they found Oceanic flight 815 at the bottom of the ocean, in tact, with all passengers in tact and very dead.  Locke's father also says the same thing.</p><p>Lets examine everyone else's back story of how they got to the island.  Naomi's helicopter just crashed in the sea, Desmond was thrown overboard in a violent storm, Juliet drank some unknown substance given to her, Locke's father was smashed into a median, Danielle's research ship crashed on the island.  Perhaps they did all die, and this is the gateway to the afterlife.  Perhaps their actions on this island will determine where they spend enternity.  The island follows a similar construct to life, but with a few changes.  If you die on the island, do you go to hell or heaven?  Is the island itself Heaven, considering the others are a group of "good" people.  Since Ben is their leader, does that make him God, or Jesus?  Or is the Island hell, as Locke's father puts it, which would make Ben Satan or some devil?</p><p>I guess this explains why the others kidnap certain people.  They are separate the bad ones from the good ones..  The heaven candidates from the hell candidates.</p><p>Does this make the big bad black cloud of smoke the Reaper? Does that make the sonic fence the divide between heaven and hell?<br/>The whole thing with the babies also promotes this theory.  Life cannot be conceived on the Island, because everyone is already dead.  I guess the writers believe that Life begin at conception.  This is why Claire's baby is fine, and why all the other mothers die before the baby is born.</p><p>However, this whole "island = purgatory/afterlife" debate has a couple holes in it.  What about Michael?  If this is the afterlife, where did Ben send Michael?  To be reborn?  To heaven?  Or to wake up from purgatory back in the real world?  What about Ethan?  If he can leave the island to the real world and recruit people like Juliet, what does that make him?  An angel?</p><p>How do the numbers play into this theory?</p><p>The end of the season should be interesting.. even though this concept is very Twilight Zone-esq.  The really hasn't been a lot of build up, but it seems like the other's incoming attack on the survivor's camp with be the climax.  Along with whatever Jack knows.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Enter the Pidgin" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/enter-the-pidgin">Enter the Pidgin</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A gigantic pile of stuff that i own, but don't really want to deal with.  I like owning things.</p><p>One thing that was incredibly liberating about living in Japan for a while was my absence of stuff.  I left America with a suitcase filed with clothes, a laptop, my DS and games, and a couple personal items.  In Japan, i was free of all my worldly attachments as they were back on planet America.  Liberated.  Though, it was very reassuring that i hadn't lost anything.  A world away, my huge pile of stuff still sat there.  Still mine.  There was, maybe, once or twice that i wished i had a movie of mine with me in Japan, but beyond that, it never brought me down that i didn't have my stuff.</p><p>Well, i suppose i did have my online 'Stuff' with me.  My blog, pictures, and tons of other crap.</p><p>Truthfully, i had really been doing this for years during college.  My parents house is home to my main pile of stuff, and i would leave it up in Minneapolis, as i lived down in Platteville.  Throughout that time, i would acquire some new things and every one in a while, I would add these new things to my gigantic pile of stuff in Minneapolis.  I was never in a position where i couldn't visit my stuff pile without great difficulty.</p><p>Throughout my time in Japan, i did acquire several new things.  I started growing a new pile of stuff, and forget about what i had at home.  When i got back home, all my stuff was in one place, yet again.  My game library was all together.  My books were there, comics, flyers, etc...</p><p>But how much does all this stuff weigh me down.  Why do i need issue 43 of Nintendo power?  Who do i need a Club flyer of Bad Boy Bill from 2003?  Why do i need all my CS notes from College?</p><p>These are really just piles of stuff, and the only reason i feel the need to own them is because of sentiment.  I got that issue of Nintendo Power in the mail in 1990, and used the maps inside to beat that Nintendo Game.  I got that flyer from The Quest or Vital Vinyl when i was there that Summer and probably took pictures.  I spent fruitless amounts of time copying those notes down because it was imperative for later use.  They are a part of my history, it's not necessarily that they are monetarily valuable.  It's like being the curator for my own personal library.</p><p>This stuff is primarily relics from the past, but i hold onto things for the future.  What if i or some friend wishes to play this game, or read this book, or watch this movie, or etc?  Then we can share in part of my past.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Indigo Prophecy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/indigo-prophecy">Indigo Prophecy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/68">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/66">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
