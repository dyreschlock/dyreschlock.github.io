I got mine <a href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming" title="/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">a week and a half ago</a>, and yesterday Tony ordered <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org/?p=229" title="http://blog.t-kun.org/?p=229">one of his own</a>. ^_^.  But, it looks like we're not the only ones.</p><p>Last week, marked the first week the PSP has beaten the DS in a long time, if not ever.  But not only did the PSP beat the DS, it beat out all other consoles.  and NOT only did it just beat out of the other consoles, but it fricken creamed them by nearly 4 fold.</p><p>The PSP generated sales in the 277,000 with the PSP Slims debut week.  The week prior, the FFVII PSP sold around 75,000 of its 77,777 units.  I guess with the release of FFVII Crisis Core, sales are booming.  They've finally got their system seller.  <em>source: <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/only-in-japan/simple-2000-the-japanese-hardware-chart-304681.php" title="http://kotaku.com/gaming/only-in-japan/simple-2000-the-japanese-hardware-chart-304681.php">kotaku</a></em></p><div class='title'><b>Domestic Releases</b></div><p>Well that's good for Japan, but the PSP is looking very bright fot the month of October here in the states.</p><p>On October 9th, <b>Final Fantasy Tactics Lions War</b> is released which is a port/remake of the original Playstation One title.</p><p>On October 23rd, <b>Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles</b> is released which is also a port/remake of Rondo no Blood on the MSX.  This also contains a port of Symphony of the Night.</p><p>These two titles are huge and will definitely bring more people into the PSP area..  In fact, I'm sure these are the two biggest, if not only, reasons Tony finally got a PSP of his own ^_^.  These are, like, his two favorite games of all time.</p><p>Also in the month of October, <b>Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus</b> is released..  This is an expansion Disc for the original MGSPO, and I think it requires it too.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Life is good</b></div><p>With Final Fantasy Tactics, Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII, the PSP is starting to look VERY VERY nice, and has ample amounts of niche puzzle and rhythm titles too.</p><p>That said, I find it ironic that I haven't played my PSP for more than an hour at a time every since I got it.  Of course, I've only been playing those niche puzzle and rhythm games I own.  Once Halo 3 winds down, I plan on starting Metal Gear Solid, so that'll rack up PSP time.  Hopefully, I'll finish that up before Castlevania comes out. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/brain-age-2-rainbow-styli">Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After playing Online co-op with Justin on the first day of Halo, it was apparent that I needed a headset in order to communicate back and forth with him.  Typing up messages through AIM was simply too slow, and, unfortunately, I could not find Gage's headset anywhere.. even after tearing apart that closet.</p><p>So, I ran out to stores real quick and picked up the Halo 3 Limited Edition Wireless Headset.. Oohhh..  It comes with everything you see here:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" /><br/>Yeah, that's it.  Just the headset and the recharging cord, all for the high ticket price of $60.  This was also the same price as the non-Halo 3 headset.  I decided to go with the Halo 3 one because its subtle Halo 3 design wasn't blatant or as ugly as those Halo 3 controllers.</p><div class='title'><b>Way too expensive</b></div><p>Obviously, the big problem with this thing is the price.  The regular wired headset is only $20, and just recently Microsoft released an official Messenger kit, which comes with a mini-keyboard you can hook into your controller, and also comes with a wired headset.  That little pack costs $30.</p><p>I coulda shoulda woulda picked up one of those two products, except I went to Shopko, rather than Best Buy, Gamestop, and another store that probably would have had a bigger selection.  So my choices were a $60 normal set, or a $60 limited edition set.  I really just wanted to get back, rather than spend an hour shopping around, so I pushed aside my cheap ass nature, and bit the bullet.</p><p>It's probably difficult to manufacture, but this thing should really be $40.  Especially when you have the headset and messenger kits far cheaper.</p><div class='title'><b>How it works</b></div><p>This little thing is actually pretty slick.  Once fully charged, you sync up the headset to the 360 like you would with a wireless controller.  Once your 360 is on, hit the synchronize button, and then hit the synchronize button on the headset.  It'll connect to your 360 and link up with the first available player.  You can hit the sync button to cycle through which player the headset is for.</p><p>Unfortunately, that means I bought a $60 headset that is proprietary to the Xbox 360 and can't be used for any other devices.  It's not a blue-tooth headset, so that means, I can't use it on my phone, I can't use it on my computer, and I can't use it on a PS3 (whenever I get one).  That's definitely one advantage the PS3 has over the 360.  Use of non-proprietary products all around.</p><p>If I want a wireless headset for all these devices of mine, I'll need to drop another bit of cash for one.</p><p>Annoying.</p><p>I'm pretty sure you could use any regular wired headset with the 360 controller and  I don't think those are proprietary.</p><div class='title'><b>Crystal Clear</b></div><p>Despite it's cost, It works incredibly well, for the few hours I was using it yesterday.  It didn't pinch my ear and  I could easily and clearly hear Justin on the other end, and he said his end was just the same.  I don't know if I had the sensitivity too high, but he could hear other things going on in the background too.  Like the TV, which I did have kinda loud in the first place.</p><p>It'd be rather interesting to test that out..</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Overall, I'm not too pissed off how useless it outside of Xbox Live..  It works great.  Hopefully they'll be more games I actually want to play on the 360 over Xbox Live for me to take advantage of it..  Otherwise, that $60 really will go to waste.</p><p>Perhaps after my gaming schedule clears up, I'll pick up Tenchu Z and play Co-op with Justin online in that.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this thing at all, unless you play A LOT of Xbox Live.  Even then, I think you'd be FAR better off picking up that Messenger Kit for $30 which comes with the mini-keyboard and wired headset.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3 Initial Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After a brisk day at work on a dreary rainy day, I finally put my Halo 3 disc into the 360 and joined the One Million users online for its first day.  My main goal was to meet up with Justin and play through some Campaign levels.</p><p>So far, my experience with Halo 3 has been nearly identical to my experience with Halo 2..  Exactly the same gameplay as the previous titles, with very subtle graphic improvements.  It's really funny how identical the graphics are.  I mean, the textures are far more detailed, but the models looks the same, the animations look the same.</p><p>Of course, I'm several months late into this news.  Everyone else already experienced and bitched about it when the Beta began.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Halo 3 takes up right after the end of the Halo 2.  Master Chief finally lands after destroying another Halo, and Cortana is still missing in the hands of the enemy.  Another prophet is hell bent on exterminating humanity, and descends on earth.  You begin your assault against this prophet to protect humanity...</p><p>Something like that anyways...  Despite playing through Halo 1 and 2, I really never paid attention to the story.  The actual story portreyed in those games seemed like running from battle to battle.  The action is what really drove the game, and all the back story and plot fell behind for me.</p><p>That.. and I never cared for Halo at all, so I didn't care to pay attention.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Co-op</b></div><p>Well, today is a brand-new day, and once Justin and I got into the same lobby online, we were off into the single player.  Unfortunately, Co-op campaign was just a little bit laggy for me to really get into it.  It wasn't terribly laggy, but just enough for me to notice.  Running side-by-side with Justin was quite entertaining.</p><p>We only played a little bit, since staying up all night to buy the game really didn't give us time to sleep.  After he took off, I played a bit of Solo.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo Player</b></div><p>Solo I found more legible to play.  I actually knew what was going on, and could find my way around without too much trouble.  I could also stop and look at the environment without getting left behind by Justin.. heh.</p><p>Halo 3's beginning is very parallel to the beginning of Halo 2, but without the whole cheesy special effects space battle at the beginning which was quite entertaining.  I love being back on earth, but I haven't gotten to any cities or urban areas yet..</p><p>One thing I did love about Halo 2 was seeing the metropolis off in the distance, gradually traveling closer, and eventually fighting the covenant inside the city..  fighting in buildings, driving warhogs through the streets..  You actually got to battle the aliens on our home turf and showed them we meant business.</p><p>In Halo 3, I'm still on earth, and they're still plenty of aliens to ward away, so hopefully we'll get into urban environments..  then again, it probably doesn't want to copy Gears of Wars too much.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>I didn't want to get too far in the campaign mode without Justin, so I went over to Multiplayer in full expectations of getting my ass kicked and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get completely killed, though.  I was able to pull off a couple wins and gain a few ranks</p><p>Halo 3's leveling system is kinda neat.  You get so much Experience points for your placement in ranked matches, which will determine who you are matched up against to battle.  The matchmaker service does everything for you, and it took me NO time to get into a room and start fighting people.  MUCH MUCH better than Lost Planet, which took me 30 minutes to find a decent room on my own, and then be "matched" up against top-level people when I was just beginning.</p><p>Levels are kinda screwy at the moment since everyone is just starting out, but by next week or the week after, the top-players will really start to distance themselves for the mediocre players, and games should be quite balanced.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Statistical Tracking</b></div><p>Bungie keeps track off ALL Xbox Live ranked matches and will update all your stats online with much more detail than what the game will tell you.</p><p>Here are my awesome stats: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock" title="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock</a></p><p>Whooo...  At the time of this writing, they aren't exactly up to the minute.  I think I'm a private now, after 6 or 7 matches.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Halo 3 is pretty fun so far..  I think its hilarious how Microsoft is marketing this as the biggest multimedia seller of all time, but, as Tony had pointed out, it's not as big as Harry Potter.</p><p>Also, I'm a mere 3 chapters into the story of the game, and there are supposedly a total of 9 chapters..  short, much?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3 Midnight Release" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This evening marks the release of one of the most anticipated games of all time, Halo 3.  It's a strike for western gaming in the console market.  When Microsoft began treading into Console territory, would anyone had guessed that their IP would be the number one best selling pre-order of all time?</p><p>To mark this event further, Best Buy announced several midnight releases at their stores throughout the country.. One of these stores just happened to be a few blocks away from my house, here in Madison ^_^.</p><p>After watching the season premiere of Heroes, Tony graciously joined me in line in front of Best Buy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" /></p><p>At 9pm, the line really wasn't all that long at all.  Tony and I parked at the end and played some Pacman Vs. on DS.  I was actually surprised that one other person in line actually had a DS, but I wasn't so surprised that most of the other avid Xboxers were tossing around a football and yelling obscenities at each other as loud as they could.  It also didn't surprise me when one of their friends drove on by with Rap music blasting out of their car speakers.</p><p>2 hours went by pretty quickly. After Tony beat me 3 out of 5 matches in Pacman, I tried to write up my Phoenix Wright article but got distracted really easy by Wikipedia and other various pieces of information on the internet.  Apparently Wisconsin has a state fossil..  it's a trilobite.  Minnesota, on the other hand, does not have a state fossil -_-;;</p><p>At 11 o'clock, one of the managers came outside with blue tickets for the Halo 3 inflatable chairs..

| September 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After toying with what to do this weekend throughout the course of the week, at the last minute, I actually decided to go home.  I really needed to get up to UW-Eau Claire and retrieve my bowling ball, which was in my little brother's possession, and while together, we decided to go the extra couple of driving hours to reach Minneapolis.</p><p>Today on the way, we stopped off in downtown Minneapolis and took a look at something I didn't get around to doing when I was home last time.  I think that was around 2 months ago.</p><p>We took a look at what was left of the 35W bridge that had collapsed into the Mississippi River on that July Thursday evening around 6pm.</p><p>Parallel to the 35W bridge is another bridge about 200 feet away that connects part of the yuppie downtown area to dinkeyville and the UofM on the other side of the river.  We ended up parking a block or two away from the north foot of that bridge in the fraternity sector of campus and begin to make our way south along the bridge overlooking the disaster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" /></p><p>Here's the northern foot of 35W, collapsed into a train yard.  Those two train cars were udderly crushed from the weight of the bridge and its rush hour inhabitants.  Here's a closeup:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" /></p><p>There were two very large chunks of the bridge still left for disposal.  The closest chunk used to lay atop one of the shelves at the base of the river.  When I first saw this chunk, i thought, "jesus.. no wonder this crappy bridge feel apart."  Honestly, that bridge has got to be the most brittle construction job ever done.</p><p>It looks like 35W was nothing but a thin slap of concrete stretching all the way across the Mississippi being held up by a couple steel beems balancing on 3 or 4 raised shelves.  This bridge should've been torn down years ago and replaced..  I guess time did that for them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" /></p><p>Further down, all the metal beems that linked itself to this whole chunk were absolutely warped, crushed, bent, squished, etc..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" /></p><p>In the river, another team was worked on pulling part of the bridge emerged in the water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" /></p><p>and further on in that picture is that other most solid chunk left of the wreckage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" /></p><p>It's really bizarre to think that a heavily used highway was there only 2 months ago.

| September 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, my work day was spent using POI HSSF, which can read and write Excel spreadsheets in Java.  You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Currently, I'm in the middle of 2 games: Oblivion and Phoenix Wright 3.  Since starting Oblivion, I haven't touched Phoenix Wright 3, which is making things difficult.  I want to finish up Phoenix Wright 3 and get it out of the way before Halo 3 comes out next week, but I also want to enjoy Phoenix Wright 3..  I find it somewhat annoying that I'm putting so much emotion stock into Halo 3.....</p><p>Phoenix Wright 3 is a bit better than its previous game, but it's just as boring..  I really only want to progress through the game to the full grasp of story and finish off that series.  I think this weekend, I'm really going to have to power through it, and write my peace on it.</p><p>Getting into Oblivion wasn't the greatest idea either...  I figured that I would just play it for a couple hours and then stop cold turkey because of how crappy it is.. but unfortunately, it is actually better than I thought, and I'm having fun with it ^_^.</p><p>On top of these two games, I want to give Final Fantasy VII a go, and have been waiting to play Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.. but maybe they'll have to wait.  There's a slew of other PSPs games I also want to start playing, too.  Check out my PSP shelf..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" /></p><p>Not bad, huh?  All these games were purchased between $10 and $15, too.  See.. I can still be a cheap ass when the opportunity arises.  There's still a couple PSP games out there that need to drop in price..  like Parappa, Crush, and Innocent Life.</p><p>I'm going to stick to my 2-game policy to prevent myself from burning out.  I must beat Phoenix Wright over the weekend to make way for Halo 3 on Tuesday.  I think when I'm waiting in line for Halo 3, i'll probably play a little more Brain Age 2.</p><p>Anyways, feel free to complain about how much I spend on video games in the comment section. ^_^  I'm going back to Oblivion.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-avalon-los-angeles-240606">Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The last I came across of sasha was back when his CD fundacion was released about 2 years ago.  I figured that he must've been up to something since then.</p><p>Well, he's not touring around, but he did release a CD between now and then.  That would be the title of this article, Sasha @ Avalon so on and so forth.  I wasn't that big a fan of fundacion but Airdrawndagger and Involver are two of my favorite CDs, so i'll give it a chance.</p><div class='title'><b>Limited Edition</b></div><p>No Luck, actually.  This CD is limited to a mere 10,000 copies, and when I searched for it on Amazon, Ebay and Half.com, the cheapest discs were going for $100.  I love Sasha, but with his current trend of music, there was no way I was going to put down that amount of cash for a CD.</p><p>Thank god for Google.  I checked to see where I could find this disc for the cheapest.  A couple places had it for $15 and $20.  Really?!  Oh wait, they're out of stock.  I continued to wade through these cheap out of stock copies, when I came across two sites that said they actually had it in stock..  walmart.com and Bull Moose audio.</p><p>No way.. they probably just forgot to update their inventories.  That didn't stop me though..  at $20 with a possibility of being in stock, why not just order it?  The least that could happen would be your order canceled and money returned.  So I went for it..  I ordered one copy from Walmart, and another from Bull Moose.</p><p>Success!  Both of my orders were processed, shipped, and received!</p><div class='title'><b>Presentation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" /></p><p>The packaging is pretty badass..  It comes in slip cases that look a lot replicas of vinyl sleeves.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0323.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0324.webp" /></p><p>Quite a spectacular little collection for being a CD release of a live set.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>Sasha @ Avalon is very much in his fundacion style as of late.  Very progressive compared to his previous styles of Involver and pre-Involver.  Sasha's motive for music is to build upon many different layers of sound, which he's been systematic putting into his style ever since learning Abelton Live and going completely digital.</p><p>I don't get his new style, though.  He builds tons of layers, but all the layers eventually blend into each other, with no defintion of melody or sound.  It all sounds the exact same to me and very stands out what-so-ever.  When I listen to his new style, I completely forget I'm even listening to the music.  Later on, I'll check the playlist and realize I've gone through 5 or 6 songs already..  sigh.</p><p>Avalon is quite similar to this style but does break away into melody and definition in a few spots.  The first disc has a couple tracks that are wonderful..  Unlike all the fundacion tracks, I actually start humming them thinking back to the cd. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't enough of these tracks that make me love this cd as a whole.  These tracks are quite soothing, but don't bring the painting into a full composition.</p><p>Not only that, but he suffers a train wreck in the first track of the second cd.  What the hell is up with that?  The only reason this cd is so expensive is because of its rarity..  This is definitely one to download, rather than purchase.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on each individual track:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Salmon Fried Rice" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/salmon-fried-rice">Salmon Fried Rice</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Today and the other day, I made some of the most delicious fried rice I've ever tasted.  It was mostly due to the main ingredient, but it was so damn good, I must share with you what I tasted.</p><p>You will mainly need 3 ingredients..  two eggs..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0424.webp" /></p><p>Rice..  1 cup cooked should do.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0425.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0425.webp" /></p><p>and your super expensive Salmon purchased in Seattle..  or any Salmon really.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0426.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0426.webp" /></p><p>Prepare your pan with some butter..  not too much though.  I'm quite sure that THAT is too much butter.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0427.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0427.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0427.webp" /></p><p>Let the butter melt for a little while, and slap that super tasty salmon into your pan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0428.webp" /></p><p>For this recipe, you'll have to defile the sanctity of the salmon and tear it to shreds.  Break that succulent salmon apart into a million tiny pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0429.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0429.webp" /></p><p>Once the salmon starts to cook a bit, plop on two eggs.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0430.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0430.webp" /></p><p>Then start swishing around everything together.  Be sure to completely mix and combine both ingredients as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0431.webp" /></p><p>Then comes the rice.  Plop that on top on begin to fully combine all 3 ingredients now.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0433.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0433.webp" /></p><p>Actually, i suppose I forgot one ingredient: Soy Sauce.  Put a very very tiny bit of the sauce over the top of your concoction.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0434.webp" /></p><p>Like all previous steps, mix mix mix.  Fully mix together all parts until you get it completely consistent.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0435.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0435.webp" /></p><p>That's it!  Fill up your bowls and viola!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0436.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070918_rice/100_0436.webp" /></p><p>The salmon mixed together is the absolute oral experience.  The hint of butter.. the hint of soy sauce.. all wrapped around the superb taste of the divine fish.</p><p>This recipe is extremely basic, but the taste of extraordinary..  Of course, it's the salmon that brings this fantastic taste to the table in the first place.  Unfortunately, it is a very basic bi-product of the salmon, so it's difficult to focus this as the center of your dinner.  Some green beans on the side would act as a brilliant compliment to this outstanding meal.</p><p>Give it a try if you have some $50 fish sitting around the house ^_^.</p><p><em>PS: The images might not show up in an RSS reader because I turned off hot-linking from my site.
