| December 25, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last class of the calendar year, I did Christmas lessons with my students.  Most classes were dated nicely the week or two before Christmas, but two of the last classes were back in November.  I thought it would be awkward for a Christmas lesson in November, so I just didn't do it for those classes.</p><div class='title'><b>Christmas Wish Tree</b></div><p>For the older classes, we made Christmas wish trees.  This class was amazingly relaxing, and great way to end the year stress free.  I passed out a bunch of green paper, and the students drew their hands.  Where the <b>English</b> comes into the lesson is that they're to write what they want for Christmas on the fingers.  If they don't know the English, then they can ask me, and they learn a bunch of new words that they're interested in.</p><div class='title'><b>Christmas Vocabulary</b></div><p>For the younger grades, making a Christmas wish tree is difficult, so we simply did a lesson with Christmas vocabulary.  And I talked a little bit about Christmas in the United States.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>Overall, the Christmas Tree was a great way to end the year.  It brought the whole class together to create something.  It was relaxing because I was basically working with the students, rather than teaching them, and running the class.</p><p>The ３<span class='ja'>年生</span> class was JUST barely able to do the Christmas wish tree.  Our class didn't finish on time, and the Homeroom teacher basically took 10 or 15 minutes out of their next classes to assemble the tree themselves.  I went by later and saw how it came out.  The difficulty layed with writing the English words.</p><div class='title'><b>The Song</b></div><p>For some classes, I taught them "We wish you a Merry Christmas", but that really ate into the time for the class.  Making the Christmas Tree takes the entire 45 minutes, and there's really no extra time at all.  I could've probably had it playing in the background.  Or I could've gotten a whole mix of Christmas songs to play in the background while everyone worked.  That probably would've been better.</p><p>I choose "We wish you a Merry Christmas" because there's only 4 different lines of lyrics.  But, like choosing any song, it took forever to find something just right.  Many versions of "We wish you a Merry Christmas" have more than just those 4 lyrics.</p><p>Originally, I went with Weezer's "Wish you a Merry Christmas" because I liked how it sounded.  It had those extra lyrics, but I thought it'd be OK.  The students hated that song.  They couldn't stand it.  And the teacher was the same way.  I mean, I didn't hate the song, but I could take it or leave it.</p><p>I switched to use the Barbie Christmas Carol version of the song.  I thought it had the perfect tone.  It was whimsical and musical.  Plus, it only had those 4 lines, too!  The problem with this song is the speed.  It's way too fast.  Some of the students could sing along and keep up, but others were struggling to keep pace.</p><p>Also, the younger kids had trouble saying, "tidings."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon">Takaoka Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I came to Japan to work, I had 3 goals for the year.  One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okura Waterfall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okura-waterfall">Okura Waterfall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's about a 15 minute drive whether it's by highway, or by country roads.  Kiyomi is a very narrow village.  The Seseragi Road travels the entire length of the village from it's most southern point to the center of the town in the northwest.  Another road goes directly east from there covering the rest of the village.  It's about an hours drive to cover all of Seseragi, but it shows just how stunning beautiful the nature of the Japanese mountains can be.  </p><p>I recently did a report about Kiyomi.  There's about 3000 residents.  The main industry of Kiyomi is farming, of which most are dairy farmers.  Turns out there are actually more cows in Kiyomi than people.  There's more than 5000 registered cows.</p><p>98% of Kiyomi is heavily wooded and mountainous terrain.  As their website states, Kiyomi is mostly wilderness, and everything else is inhabited by close and loving families of farmers.  Any random person you talk with in Kiyomi will mention how great Kiyomi is for being with family.</p><p>But, in that 98% wilderness, there are some beautiful hiking trails, camp grounds, and waterfalls, too.  In November, it still hadn't snowed yet.  It was still too warm.  On this rainy day, I went to visit one of the more popular and easily accessible waterfalls of Kiyomi, the Okura waterfall.</p><p>It's about an hours hike from Seseragi up the mountain to where the Okura waterfall has its largest cliff.  Throughout the hike, you follow the stream of water it produces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to September Rain" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/september-rain">September Rain</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I teach in Takayama City in the Gifu prefecture of Japan.  Like many places, Takayama has many unique qualities that set it apart from other areas in Japan.  One of these unique qualities is that Takayama is the largest city in Japan by area.  It is 2178 km<superscript>2</superscript>, which is the size of most counties in Wisconsin.</p><p>It was only recently that this happened, too.  In 2005, there was some government restructuring, and several neighboring villages became under the Takayama Municipality.  These are the villages of Shokawa, Kiyomi, Kokofu, Nyukawa, Miya, Kuguno, Asahi, Kamitakara, and Takane.  Their government offices became branches of Takayama, and Takayama's government now ran these towns, too.  Or something like that.</p><p>Despite having such a large land area, there's only 92,000 some people living here.  And only 60,000 or 70,000 people in the central Takayama city.  The outer lands of Takayama have a lot of mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods in the valleys connected by narrow winding roads.  The most distant and ill-populated of which is Takane.</p><p>Even at the time of the merge, Takane didn't even have 1000 residents.  Wikipedia says they had 780 in 2003.  But, they were still their own municipality, complete with its very own Elementary and Junior High schools.  At least they did until 2007.  2 years after the Takayama merge, with such few students, they closed those schools down.  And the school children of Takane now take a bus to the next village over, Asahi.</p><p>Over the summer, I wanted to visit Takane, and see what this forest oasis looked like, and I went with new ALT Simona who had just arrived in Japan 2 weeks prior.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" /></p><p>And this is basically it.  After driving through some thick forests, and windy mountain roads, there are a few houses, a couple of buildings, and then the forests open up a little bit, and you're greeting with the post office.  Takane is a very vertical village.  The residents shaved off a side of the one of mountains, and set up town.  There's a ryokan, city hall, the post office, several houses, rice fields, and a few apartment buildings.  But, there's really no commerce at all.  No convenience store.  Not even a grocery store.  I think there was a liquor store, though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" /></p><p>This place reminds me of LOST.</p><p>Most of the traffic through the town are logging trucks heading up river to the logging camps past the massive dams.</p><div class='title'><b>Takane JHS / <span class='ja'>高根中</span></b></div><p>Tucked away on the ends of the town were the former schools.  Takane JHS was near the center of the town.  Anyone living in town could easily walk there.  It's on the other side of the valley, and mostly visible from the town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" /></p><p>Most of the school was abandoned and no longer cared for.  The foot lockers in the entrance way were all torn up.  And the inside of the gym was dirty and probably hadn't been visited in over a year.  Out back was the incinerator, and changing rooms which had plenty of rust and wood damage.</p><p>Though, right next to the gym was a "gate ball" arena, so the elderly people in town were still coming up here on a regular basis.  (Gate ball is very similar to croquet)</p><div class='title'><b>Takane ES / <span class='ja'>高根小</span></b></div><p>On the way into and out of town is Takane ES.  Unlike the Junior High, this building still showed plenty signs of use.  Looking in the windows, we could clearly see that the Home Ec. room was completely clean and well kept.  The village probably still holds cooking classes for the residents.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" /></p><p>The most interesting part of the elementary school was the student entrance.  Across the 4 windows of the entrance were goodbye messages written by the students in the final year of the school.  The school's student must've been divided into 4 groups for doing activities, and cleaning, and whatever.  Each group got to write their messages on a window.</p><p>Many of the messages say <span class='ja'>いつでも</span>Happy (Always Happy), and <span class='ja'>高小サイユー</span> (Takane ES Goodbye).  It's hard to tell exactly how many students attended the school in its last year, but from counting the messages, maybe 30 or 40 students were there.</p><p>It's cute, and sad, but amazing that all these messages are still there 6 years after the fact.  A record.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 6 Months in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/6-months-in-japan">6 Months in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 25, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, I completed my online certification for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, or TEFL, and I got a fabulous piece of paper saying that much.  Certifications are fine, and all, but they really don't mean a whole lot unless you actually learn something from the course, and can apply that knowledge to your life.</p><div class='title'><b>Goals</b></div><p>I had two reasons for taking this course.  My ultimate goal was to use this knowledge and experience to get a job as an ALT in Japan through the JET Program.  Having a TEFL certificate would help my chances to get the job.</p><p>After applying and interviewing for the position, I felt very inexperienced and novice as a teacher.  So, while having a simple certificate saying I was TEFL certified might help me get the job, and I actually needed the knowledge and experience so I could actually do the job once I got it.</p><p>I looked to this course for guidance, definition, and technique.  And, I really took this course in two parts.</p><div class='title'><b>Taking the Course</b></div><p>For the first lessons, there was plenty of definition.  While it seemed like a lot of obvious information, it was clear and verbose.  There were plenty of questions that I could answer, but never really thought about that much in depth before.  A teacher must be knowledgeable, patient, energetic, adaptive, and a learner.  They must be a manager, organizer, resource, model, and tutor.</p><p>When I made it to Unit 9, that's where technique, lesson planning and execution, was introduced into the course.  And this is also where I stopped for about 4 months.  The JET program had finally accepted me, and I was going to Japan!  When I got to Japan, I was very nervous.  Even though, I had plenty of definition, it's really no substitute for experience or training.</p><p>I fumbled along in classes, but I tried my best.  I made sure to keep eye contact, keep a sharp authoritative voice, be consistent, and be a model for the students.  The definitions I had learned were in my mind, and I tried to stay true to them as best as I could.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>When I finally picked up Unit 9 again, I was absolutely amazed at how useful all the information on lesson planning had become to me.  All the information up to Unit 9 felt very nice to have, and good in theory, but didn't really help me in a concrete way.</p><p>From Unit 9 on, all the planning, and structure helped me build my own lessons for my classes.  It was fantastic.  Most of my initial lesson plans fell a little flat, and didn't really have any flow.  Once I started going through all the Units, my lesson plans became pretty solid, and I felt like the students really took away something in class.  They had fun, and left with a smile. :)</p><p>I feel like I was able to get all 3 things I wanted from this course.  I found plenty of definition in the beginning.  Once I was able to put this course to use, all the techniques I learned were incredibly helpful.  And after completing this course, I have all the answers to go back through whenever I need guidance, and just a reminder on what I should be doing in class.</p><p>So while I got piece of paper that says I'm a TELF certified, I feel I have the confidence and knowledge to back it up, and that's what I needed from this course.</p><p>And, as a final test of that knowledge, I had to write an essay about teaching for a number of available topics.  So, I choose and wrote about the following:</p><div class='title'><b>The Role of a Teacher</b></div><p>The role a teacher plays in the lives of students is significant.  The teacher's role in the classroom is of obvious importance, but the job of a teacher isn't over when class finishes, or when school is over for the day.  A teacher is a teacher all hours of the day, all days of the week.  They are ambassadors of education, and the most important roles for a teacher are to be a manager, an organizer, a resource, a tutor, and a model.</p><p>One of the most important roles a teacher must be is a manager.  A teacher needs to take control of the class, and chart its course for success.  They need to command respect of their students, and let them know they're in charge.  That doesn't mean you must "rule" with an iron fist, though.  Be strict, but be patient, kind, and always listen to your students.  The class isn't about you.  It's about them.  Knowing their needs will make you an effective manager.</p><p>The backing behind an effective manager is being able to organize your class.  A teacher needs to be able to give instructions to their students, and have them able to complete work for themselves.  A teacher needs to keep their students on task and focused on the subject.  And a teacher needs to know how to use the classroom to promote learning of the subject.</p><p>However, a teacher must always be there for their student when they run into a trouble.  As a resource, the teacher is their primary source of material for the course, and should have the ability to answer any question the student has.  This doesn't mean that the teacher needs to know everything.  A good teacher must be a student, too, and always be hungry for knowledge.  They need to have the resources themselves to find out more, and demonstrate that new knowledge to the students.</p><p>As a resource, you help out those most curious, but as a tutor you help out those in need the most.  The role of a tutor promotes trust among the students, and let's them know that no one is left behind.  The teacher will always be there for them, and they can always ask questions.  In a teacher's life, the students must always come first.  It's your mission to see that they all succeed and flourish.</p><p>And lastly, while being a manager holds great importance in the classroom, I think that being a model is the most important role for a teacher.  The students must come first, but holding yourself to the same standard you expect of them should come to a near second.  Students look to you as an example, and you need to provide them with an exemplary one.  A teacher needs to have confidence in themselves, and their knowledge of the subject to be taken seriously.  If you don't have confidence in yourself, then students won't have confidence in you.</p><p>I think it's the most important role because it doesn't end when class or school is over.  Students are around you all the time, so you must be a model citizen, too.  Your behavior in real life must be consistent with your behavior in the classroom, or else the students will lose confidence and faith in you as a person.</p><p>All 5 of these roles build a very well rounded teacher.  A tutor and resource build trust and confidence.  A manager and organizer build respect and structure.  And a model shows them how to use their knowledge and enlighten their lives.  I've been a teacher for 3 months now, and I make sure to inhabit these 5 roles at school and in my daily life.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ikibina Matsuri" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ikibina-matsuri">Ikibina Matsuri</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 5, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On April 3rd, the village of Miya, just south of Central Takayama City, hold a festival called Ikibina Matsuri, or, The Living Doll Festival.  I didn't really know anything about this festival beforehand.  I heard about it from my friend Ikuko, who was very interested in it, and wanted to visit and attend.  So, she did, and we went!</p><div class='title'><b>Hina Matsuri</b></div><p>The Ikibina Matsuri is a regional version of the Hina Matsuri.  The Hina Matsuri takes place on March 3rd, and celebrate's Girl's Day, or, sometimes, Doll's Day.  For Hina Matsuri, families will cover shelves with a red carpet and display dolls on them.  Many people associate this holiday with the beginning of Spring, and the start of warmer days ahead.</p><p>But, for the Hida Takayama area, Winter is still very strong, and the snow doesn't start melting for another month, at least.</p><p>For Hina Matsuri, I went to the Hida Folk Village in town, or Hida no Sato.  This village is a half-preserved, half-recreated area from a few hundred years ago.  All the homes represent the style of architecture at the time.</p><p>As you can see, it was still very much Winter on March 3rd up here.  There's no hint of Spring at all.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" /></p><p>But, they still displayed all the dolls in the houses.  Spring will come eventually!</p><div class='title'><b>Ikibina Matsuri</b></div><p>Since it's still Winter on March 3rd, the Hida Takayama area waits for one month, and has their own celebration on April 3rd, instead.  And rather than arranging a bunch of dolls on a red-carpeted display, young women and kids from the surrounding towns wear the outfits of the dolls, and parade around town.</p><p>Ikuko and I arrived in Miya around 10am.  All of the snow in the area had melted, but it was still rather cold and miserable.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" /></p><p>It rained almost all day. :(  Usually, the parade will begin at the shrine, and continue down the street, along the river.  Then cross the river, and come back to the shrine.  Since it was raining, they restricted the parade to inside of the shrine, instead.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1262.webp" /></p><p>So, all of the people that came to watch the parade were shoved inside of the Ichinomiya Minasha Shrine.  The parade started on one end of the shrine, and all the women and kids moved around the hallways bordering the area.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1294.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1347.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1347.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1372.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1372.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1372.webp" /></p><p>The parade has several princesses dressed in pink, some kids, guards, a king and a queen.  The went around the inside of the shrine a few times.  When the parade was finished all of the cast enters the shrine to pray.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1423.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1423.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Hyouka</b></div><p>So, when I first came to Takayama, I went around to a bunch of the touristy places in town.  I kept seeing all these anime posters on the walls of stores, and museums.  They were all for the same anime, and they advertised Takayama.  So, upon further inspection, these posters mentioned a title: <b>Hyouka</b>.  Later, I looked it up on the Internet, and not only is it an anime, but the whole takes place in Takayama.</p><p>The anime centers on 4 high school students that go to Hida High School, a few blocks away from where I live. :)  Many locations in town are represented almost perfectly in the show, so it was really neat to watch that show when I first arrived.  Some of it was like an introduction video. :)</p><p>Overall, the show is OK.  It's not the best anime, but it doesn't suck.  The plot of the show centers are 4 high school students as they revive a literary club at the school, and then solve mysteries, instead.</p><p>I bring this up because for the final episode of the TV show, the main girl character, Eru Chitanda plays the lead in the Ikibina Matsuri.  So, the whole episode focuses on the festival, and a dumb mystery to solve.</p><p>Because of how accurate Hyouka represents areas in Takayama, the festival and the Ichinomiya Minasha Shrine was depicted rather well.</p><p>Here's a shot from the TV Show:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" /></p><p>And here's a photo I took:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" /></p><p>They're pretty close :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" /></p><p>That's the inside of the Shrine and the outside.</p><div class='title'><b>Satomi Satou</b></div><p>Eru Chitanda is voiced by Satomi Satou, who apparently a big deal since he also voiced a character in K-On, which is very popular.

| December 6, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, legendary DJ Richie Hawtin came to Madison on his CNTRL Tour, which comes with the title "Beyond EDM".  The Beyond EDM moniker is the driving force behind this tour, and has several meanings behind itself.</p><p>Initially my thoughts were that "Beyond EDM" meant an exposure to other genres outside of the massive popularity of Electro House, Dubstep, Pop House, some Trance, and everything you hear on the radio, in most clubs, and so forth.  Many of the new kids to the scene don't realize the rich history and beautiful sounds of true House, Techno, and other more minimal genres that built the scene back in the day.</p><p>But, aside from exposure, the "Beyond EDM" meant something else, and something more.  In the strictest sense, "Beyond EDM" means there's more than just the music.</p><p>"Beyond EDM" means connections.  The wonderful thing about nearly all of electronic dance music is the community that supports it.  For those who are fans, it's about connecting with other fans and artists, supporting them, and sharing music.  For those who are artists, it's about reaching your fans, growing your fanbase, connecting with other artists, and supporting them too.  Support and Collaboration.</p><p>The best (and most unique) thing about Richie Hawtin's CNTRL tour was the education and community focus.  Earlier in the evening, Hawtin held a round-table style discussion and lecture at each of his tour stops, completely free.  Hawtin had 3 or 4 other panelists, and they would discuss various topics such as "the business of EDM", "EDM: Now and Then", "The evolving artist", etc.</p><p>In Madison, Hawtin held his lecture at the Madison Media Institute in southeast Madison.  It almost immediately sold out.  Along with Richie Hawtin, Kevin Saunderson, Ean Golden, Gaise, and Kurt Eckes, from Drop Bass Network all sat in front of us all and talked about EDM for about 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp"  /></p><p>The whole format was mostly question and answer, but the questions were a little bit leading, and were really more like prompts that guided the information the panelists wanted to say.</p><p>And I wrote a bunch of notes...</p><div class='title'><b>Rave Act</b></div><p>The first main topic of the night was history.  With the explosion of EDM today, we need to look at the past to make sure the same mistakes won't happen again.  Electronic dance music was rather prevalent in the late 90s with the rave scene, but it died out.  What happened?</p><p>This question was directed at Kurt Eckes.  Eckes is one of the founders of the Drop Bass Network, a company responsible for some of the largest rave events across the midwest in the mid 90s to the 2000s.  So, what killed his events?</p><p>Kurt had a few answers, but his main answer was the Rave Act, and the negative publicity of raves in general.  The Rave Act basically slammed an event where any illegal substance was found with a massive fine.  Cops would have the authority to raid any event they believed had a substance, and run through everyone there until they found something, or were satisfied enough, and left.</p><p>This was a huge bummer for several reasons.  Kurt admitted that nearly all of the parties he put on were illegal.  They never checked for drugs, and they pretty much didn't care.  After the Rave Act was introduced, it was way too risky to continue the way they were.  Hiring a bunch of security guards was a bummer.  And if, on the off chance, a party attendee brought something, and the Cops raided the place, he'd be slammed by the law.</p><p>Aside from that, other companies that did throw legal parties were still getting busted.  The cops would shut down the music, have everyone on the ground, and comb the place for an hour.  That's not a fun night for anyone, whether or not they actually find something.</p><p>The Rave Act killed the fun, and made everything too damn risky.  And Kurt's personal interest in the business was beginning to wane, and it just felt like too much damn work to go through all the red tape.</p><div class='title'><b>Clubs</b></div><p>One solution to the problem was to move the scene into the clubs.  But this had its own problem.  The club scene is not the rave scene.  Aside from banning illegal substances, clubs had strict operating hours.  Most of the places in the midwest had to close at 3am.  Most raves went until dawn, or even past dawn, continued through the next day, and night.  Raves never stop, but clubs certainly do.</p><p>The Rave kids just weren't into the club scene, so they just didn't go.  And with raves dying out, they had nowhere to go, and basically quit the music scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Shorter Sets</b></div><p>Even the artists had to adapt to the time restrictions.  DJs could no longer spin a 5 or 6 hour set on their own, they only had a time slot of an hour or 2.  True DJs don't play song after song after song, they play a set.  Songs are chosen to build off of each other, and tell a story.  6 hours is plenty of time to tell a story and try out new things.  But now that time has shrunk.  You can't tell a 6 hour story in just one hour.  There's not enough time to build, and have variety.  And instead of having 30 minutes to build up, you only have about 3.</p><p>There's very little time to be creative and flesh out anything new, too.  Hawtin mentioned that he really needs a good 4 hour set to try out new things.</p><p>To tell all that you want to tell, you need to build the intensity much faster with the shorter sets.  The story is condensed, and faster.</p><div class='title'><b>Larger Shows</b></div><p>Richie Hawtin asked the question, "Was the scene blowing up because of Skrillex, or did Skrillex blow up so fast because of how fast the scene grew?"  Obviously both the scene and Skrillex benefitted from each other greatly, but which one really started it?</p><p>Deadmau5 and Skrillex have raised the bar with the amount of production put into their stage performance at their shows.  But with the larger scale shows, this is so many more things that can go wrong.  Everything must be choreographed, and perfect for the show to be a hit.  Failure can be easy, so these DJs don't take as many risks anymore.  They can't.  They have to stick to a schedule, and can't be as flexible.</p><p>In fast, Deadmau5, who never considered himself a DJ in the first, really doesn't consider his artist persona his main job anymore.  He says that his title is an "event driven marketer."</p><div class='title'><b>Music Sales Today</b></div><p>Another big difference between the scene today and yesterday is that Music does not sell the way it used to, which is really due to piracy.  The whole panel really didn't slam piracy at all while they were up there.  Exposure is exposure.  It's just another vehicle to get your music out there and heard.</p><p>Hawtin gave the comparison that the scene was about a tenth of the size back in the day, but they sold about 10 times more records.  Which is incredible to think of.  But!  They were selling actual records.  These days, you can buy a whole album for $2 on the internet (or just pirate it).  And there's a ridiculous amount of competition.</p><p>Piracy is real and the competition, and the artist needs to be aware of these things.  You cannot survive on record sales alone.  You have to go out and perform your music, and personally spread your unique sound.</p><p>Which means you have to think of the whole package when composing music.  You have to know exactly how you're going to play your track, and design the track itself to be heard live.  And, your music ends up being advertising for your live show, and your message.</p><p>That last part is definitely true for me.  These days, if I hear something I like, I seek out the artist, and if I really like what they're doing, I want to see them live.  The live experience is a completely different monster than hearing something on the computer, or the iphone.  It is the whole package.</p><div class='title'><b>Balancing performance and creation</b></div><p>Building music and advertise your music means that you'll be out on the road and in the clubs a lot.  Hawtin finds himself having to schedule time to actually create tracks...  which is difficult.  You can't schedule creativity.  You need to be prepared to act when inspiration strikes.</p><p>And that isn't all that hard these days.  A lot of the music people make is on their laptops, and the very laptops they bring around with them to perform.  Going from studio work to club performance is nearly seamless.  You can perform works in progress, and really craft your tracks on the fly.</p><div class='title'><b>Copy Cats</b></div><p>It's really easy to make music today.  It's great for the artists, but it has opened the door for a lot of imitation and unoriginality.</p><p>You can take someone else's idea and run with it if you like, but people aren't as stupid as you think.  Fans and other artists are very in tune with what they hear and what they like and can spot a fake almost immediately.  They see right through them.</p><p>If you have no substance, authenticity, or originality, then you won't get far.  You have to be you.  Be natural.  Be genuine.  And the distinctiveness will shine with time.</p><div class='title'><b>Technology</b></div><p>The next question asked if anyone on the panel found it difficult to be creative with the massive influx of technology in the scene.</p><p>Hawtin replied with, "Technology opened up music creatively for me."  (or something like that.  damn autocorrect.)</p><p>He posed the question to the audience, "Do you really really care if the DJ is using the sync function on stage?"  Most of the audience basically just said no.</p><p>He continued by stating that Beat Matching is really is more mechanical than creative.  The machines we use today are WAY more precise than a record and a turntable.  DJ no longer have to chase records, and constantly make sure everything is synced up.  Technology today is incredibly liberating.  It gives the DJ peace of mind.</p><p>As such, they're able to be more creative and complex.  Hawtin can blend more than just two tracks together, and build a more unique layered sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp"  /></p><p>He demonstrated what he meant by that.  He went over to his laptop, and ran some sounds with each other using Traktor.  He had one track supply the baseline, while he blended the melody of two other tracks on top of that, and a fourth track with some samples.  This kind of thing is just not feasible with turntables.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment</b></div><p>The next train of thought went to the environment.  While the music should stand on its own, you're kidding yourself if you don't think the environment doesn't enhance the music.  Whether it be the crowd, or visuals, or being animated on stand, the environment is part of the performance.  It's part of building that moment for the audience.  And for some people, it's the catalyst that launches them into music, and transports them to another place.</p><div class='title'><b>Be Proactive</b></div><p>The scene is build on the idea of DIY, Do It Yourself.  Don't wait for someone to discover you, get out there and do it yourself!  Connect with everyone around you, and build your vision.  Reach out!</p><p>As you build your sound, let people in.  Accept criticism.  Accept help.  And give help back.  Be transparent, share idea, and include those interested around you.  That's how this scene was originally built in the first place!</p><p>Celebrate our diverse opinions, and grow!</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>Experimentation with your inspiration is how you find yourself.</p><p>Saunderson mentioned that one of the first things he ever did was attempt to copy a sound, or copy a feeling.  He would hear something, and try to recreate it from scratch in the studio.  And out of building toward that sound, the feeling, he found his own sound.  It was what he heard, but now it was through his own voice.</p><p>While copying things outright is rather opaque, you need to start somewhere.  Chasing what you like will give you direction.  And through that journey, you will find yourself.  You just need to keep at it.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>There were a couple more topics, but those were all the notes that I wrote down.  Hawtin ended the lecture with a rather inspirational quote, <b>"Dig deeper and continue to explore.  This is an incredible time.  Don't be disillusioned because popstars are making EDM tunes."</b></p><p>These times are pretty exciting.  I've met more people in the last 2 years into this kind of music, that I have ever met before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Majestic</b></div><p>I met up with Bryan after the lecture, we had dinner, and then we went to The Majestic, where the panelists performed.  Ean Golden started off the evening with an eclectic selection of tracks that went back and forth a little too rapidly for me.</p><p>The night began for me when Gaiser took the stage, and performed live.  Beautiful, rich, heavy Techno.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Kevin Saunderson took the stage, and blended some beautiful House tracks together.  Followed up by Richie Hawtin.  Absolutely incredible night.</p><p>The whole package was something truly unique and special: an education and a mind blowing performance.</p><p>Also, I broke my goddamn camera :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oktoberfest Label Magnets" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oktoberfest-label-magnets">Oktoberfest Label Magnets</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 18, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, I started working on a project inspired by something my little brother was doing at the time.  For each unique Oktoberfest I was able to purchase and drink, I removed the label from the bottle, attached it to a magnet, and stuck it on my fridge.</p><p>I was able to collect 26 labels last year, and here's the result:<br/><a href="/old/v7/beer-label-magnets" title="/beer-label-magnets">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=1006</a></p><p>I started in the middle of September last year, which is pretty late to start collecting Oktoberfests, so I was ready to find all the ones I was missing this year.</p><p>Generally, Oktoberfest Beers start showing up around the middle of August, and by the time October rolls around, everything that's going to be shipped to stores has been shipped.  Many people consider the idea of Oktoberfest beers running out of stock in October (and September being the primary month) rather ironic given the name.  Even Oktoberfest itself in Germany starts in September, and ends a few days into October.</p><p>But, from the brewers standpoint, it really depends on the summer.  The Oktoberfest brewing process begins in March, and the batches are set to ferment over the summer.  And when they're done when they're done.  The true german name (or classification) of the type of beer, Marzen, makes more sense, as Marzen is german for March.  No matter when they're done, the process starts in March (and sometimes April for later batches).</p><p>Last year, I tried to keep my collecting efforts to local breweries, but I expanded this year to include (almost) anything I could find.  And I found a lot of beers that I missed.  Plus, a few that I tried last year that either changed labels, or recipes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp"  /></p><p>There's a sample of the amount of beers I've been drinking over the last 2 months.  I've been driving around to all kinds of liquor stores looking for new beers.  I've been to almost all the ones in Madison.  I went up to Minnesota, and drove around a bit.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Chicago, and a couple other places.</p><p>And the results turned out pretty good.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp"  /></p><p>I doubled the amount of labels on my fridge.  I think there's a total of 52 up there now.  Milwaukee Brewery Company, Berghoff, and Sam Adams had the same beer, but changed the label.  And New Belgium release a Red Hoptoberfest (not that great :( ) compared to the Hoptoberfest they had last year.</p><p>I arranged all the labels in order by my preference, but with so many beers it's pretty subjective.  And at times difficult to remember which ones tasted better than the others.</p><p>Overall, I would say <b>Sam Adams Oktoberfest</b> is a good middle ground, mediocre Oktoberfest to judge the others on.  Anything better than Sam Adams is a good, tasty Oktoberfest, in my opinion.  When I compare, I usually start there.  If it's better, than I compare it to <b>Leinie's Oktoberfest</b>.  And from there, the process gets a little cloudy.  If it tastes similar to another one on my list, I usually place it next to (or near it).</p><p>By FAR! my favorite beer from this year is the <b>Three Floyds Munsterfest</b>.  It is incredibly smooth, with a deep rustic, autumn feel.  It's not as flavorful or deliberate as the Staghorn, but pretty damn perfect for what I look for in an Oktoberfest. Very similar to Lake Front.</p><p>Also, I had a chance to try <b>Ayinger Oktoberfest</b> which is the first German import Oktoberfest I actually liked.  I think I put it too low on my list, and will have to adjust it next year when I have more opportunities to try it again.</p><p>With the exception of Ayinger, one thing I really don't understand is why all German imported Oktoberfests taste like stale rotten Heineken piss.  They are the absolute worst beers I've had.  And they all taste very similar, so it's gotta be similar to what the Germans actually drink over there, right?  Ayinger rises above that, but still has a tinge of the Heineken taste in it.  I don't understand it.  And maybe the only way to answer this question is to actually go to Germany for Oktoberfest sometime.</p><p>Overall, I found every Oktoberfest I was looking except for one.  I really really want to try <b>Wiehanstefaner Fest Bier</b>.  Wiehanstefaner is my favorite German brewery, and I would imagine their Oktoberfest has got to be pretty good.  Hopefully that will lead me to more answers to why German Fest Biers are horrible and gross.</p><div class='title'><b>Makin' Magnets!</b></div><p>Anyway, making these magnets are pretty easy.  I outlined the process in the previous post, but I'll reiterate it here.</p><p>To remove the label, I use Wine Appeals's Wine Label Removal Kit.<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3">http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O</a></p><p>It's basically just tape that you cover the beer label with.  When you remove the tape, the label will come off with it.</p><p>And then I'm using Super 77 spray adhesive on ProMAG's Paintable Magnetic Vinyl Sheets.

I wasn't able to find anymore this year, so all I had were 2 empty bottles I saved from last year.</p><p>I tried removing the label very very slowly, but that didn't work.  Too much of the label still stuck to the bottle, and would rip the image.</p><p>I tried filling the bottle with water, cooling it, and let the condensation moisten the label to make it easier to remove.
