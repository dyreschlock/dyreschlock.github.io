| April 27, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About 2 months, I started working on a dream of mine.  A dream that I've had for many many years.  Throughout those years, I had many ideas, wants and desires, but never had the motivation to put them into code.</p><p>2 months ago, in the midst of finalizing classes for the year, and being monstrously busy with all kinds of nonsense, I had the urge to put this together.  Everything was so clear in my head.</p><p>It's one of those moments, where you feel the weight of your To-Do list, and just can't bring yourself to do anything on it.  That moment when your mind wonders, and you think about something else you could be doing.  Something equally constructive, but way more fun.  For that day, I didn't want to do anymore lesson planning, and I missed Software Development enough.</p><p>At that moment, it was time for me to finally do this.</p><p>It was time to finally rewrite theschlock.com as its own application with all of my own code, and design.</p><p>And on <a href="/old/v7/a-fresh-start" title="/a-fresh-start">March 4th</a>, the new theschlock.com was running on line for the first time.  Today, it's finally (basically) finished!</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>2 years prior, I had already created a Tapestry 5 project that ran in Jetty completely standalone from anything I had at Widen.  And I had things already organized for where I wanted to start adding classes.  </p><p>From the beginning, I knew that I wanted to write this site in Java using Tapestry 5 and Hibernate.  They were technologies I was used to.  Much of the work I did at Widen was on the backs of others smarter than me that had already built systems for others to use.  I wanted to learn how to use these technologies from scratch to better understand how they work.</p><div class='title'><b>Code Decisions</b></div><p>On the back end, there were several other decisions that I had made WELL before any code was written.</p><p>1.  This site will not have comments.  </p><p>At least, nothing internal.  I learned a long time ago from MovableType and Wordpress that any web form left unattended will get massively spammed by bots, and who knows what else.  (In the future, I might add Facebook comments if I can fit them into the design.)</p><p>2.  Further than that!  This site will only have read access to the database.</p><p>I did not want to deal with security in any manor for this site.  Nothing on the Internet is every truly secure, and anyone who would want to tear into my database has way more time, and expertise on their side.  Any wall is just an invitation, so why have any walls in the first place.  And, if I did have security, I would probably just mess it up.</p><div class='title'><b>Road Blocks</b></div><p>In any project, you'll hit a road block.  You'll come across something you don't understand, or a problem you just can't figure out.</p><p>When it's a personal project, it is very easy to just call it quits.  You're the only person on the project, and you are really the only person that cares about the outcome.  If you call it quit, it really only affects you.</p><p>Maybe it's been all those years at Widen dealing with road blocks on a daily basis, or maybe I'm just more comfortable with writing code than I was in college, or maybe I'm just more grown up now, too, and experienced.</p><p>Any road blocks I came across with this project were eventually overcome.  Any problem, or misunderstanding just took a little bit of patience, time, and (sometimes) research to think it through and figure out a solution.</p><p>Figuring out Hibernate was easy.  (Though, tapestry does all the work.)  Implementing LessCss wasn't really difficult either.  Getting tomcat running, and setting things up on a new host took some time, but I just needed to read through documentation, and chat with tech support for my host.  Figuring out how to get Japanese text working in the database took a little while, too.</p><p>Nothing was outside of my ability, and I was able to do everything I wanted.</p><div class='title'><b>Back Up</b></div><p>Theschlock.com is really just a mirror of what I have locally.  <b>I never have to worry about losing something online</b> because it's just a copy.  All the code is stored on <a href="http://github.com/dyreschlock" title="http://github.com/dyreschlock">Git Hub</a>, so I'll never lose it.</p><p>Every time I make a new post, I insert it into my local database directly with no interface.  To deploy those changes online, I make a backup, and then restore the online database with the backup.  This is AMAZING because it ensures that I will always have a backup of my data, and that the backup works!  I put every backup into my Google Drive, so I'll never lose that data either.</p><p>All my photos for theschlock.com are on both Google Drive, and my web server.  Even if all that data is lost on the server, I can just upload everything again from Google Drive.</p><p>Every time I make changes to my site, I'm redeploying it in a way that could be done any web host, not just the one I'm using now.  </p><p>This sense of security is something I NEVER had with Wordpress, or any blog software for that matter.  If any of those blogs died, everything I worked on would be gone forever.  I never have to worry about that with this approach.  Every aspect of this site is backed up, and will never be lost.  (Unless github and google are lost.)</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Writing code is pretty easy.  You just need to keep things organized, simple, and then make sure they work.  <b>Design</b> is much different beast, and a very easy road block to kill this whole project.  I haven't done much design work in the last 7 years.  And there were many times when I would design something on paper, and it would look terrible after its implementation.</p><p>The Wordpress design I had before wasn't too bad, but I didn't want the side bars.  I knew what I wanted, and those translated into User stories easily, and then to Tapestry Pages from there.</p><p>1.  The index page would be the most recent post on the site.<br/>2.  The post must be the most prominent thing on the page.<br/>3.  No side bars.  Only show the post.<br/>4.  The site must translate to mobile well.<br/>5.  Keep it simple stupid.</p><p>Like usual, my design from scratch looked like garbage.  As dumb as it sounds, searching for "good blog designs" on google gave me a lot of inspiration. :)  </p><p>I paged through a couple articles highlighting the best of the web and came across <b>Dan Cederholm's</b> website: <a href="http://simplebits.com/" title="http://simplebits.com/">Simple Bits</a>.  Holy shit, this guy's design was beautifully simple.  It hit all 5 points of my check list, and was very sharp.</p><p>I went to work using the top-down approach and the site pulled itself together pretty easily.  After my initial implementation, I had my friend <a href="http://www.mlatzke.com/" title="http://www.mlatzke.com/">Matt Latzke</a> take a look at it.  He suggested that I add a lot more spacing between components, and choose a second complimentary font for titles, and things.</p><div class='title'><b>Fonts</b></div><p>My favorite serif font is Garamond.  I've been using Garamond for my resume, term papers, and almost anything I've typed since my beginning days in college.  I wanted something better than Times New Roman, and Garamond just has a sleek simplicity to itself.  I don't know, I can't really describe it.</p><p>Matt suggested that using Garamond for absolutely every piece of text on the site was design overkill.  I didn't think it looked too bad, but having only one font did make the site feel a bit…  I dunno…  sheltered?</p><p>Anyway, I went to google again, and searched for good complimentary web fonts for Garamond.  Helvetica came up a bunch, but I didn't really like the way it looked with Garamond.  Eventually, I came across Gill Sans.  When bolded, it really stood out against Garamond.  It had very fat, but clean letters.  Very stylish, and different.</p><div class='title'><b>Archives</b></div><p>One other strong point I wanted for this site was the ease of getting to past posts, and finding everything on the site with only a few clicks.  I really hate Wordpress's pages for categories and archiving.  I want my users to be able to see everything, and find everything, and view it all in a small space.</p><p>My initial designs were terrible again, but thanks to Ray at Widen, he sent everyone a link to site with an amazing design: <a href="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html" title="http://codeofrob.com/blog.html">Rob Ashton's Blog</a>.  This site is so incredibly simple.  If I had seen this 2 months ago, theschlock.com would probably look different.</p><p>For the archives…  Shit, just dump out all the post titles on the page and line 'em up.  Nothing is more simpler than that!</p><p>I wanted to have some featured posts, too, and display an image to draw the user in.  I really like how <a href="http://www.theverge.com" title="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a> handles their recent posts on the category pages, highlights posts with images, and still keeps the design nice and clean.</p><p>I started doing something like that, but those highlighted posts naturally fell to the side of the categories and post titles.  Everything just fit together that way.</p><div class='title'><b>(Basically) Finished</b></div><p>Figuring out the design for the archive and category pages was really the last unfinished feature.  With that now complete, theschlock.com is (basically) finished!  Obviously, I'll probably change a few things here and there down the road, but this is it.</p><p>The site does pretty much everything I ever wanted, and I'm in complete control of all aspects.</p><p>"It's the [website] I've always wanted, and now I have it.  I rule!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140427_website/vlcsnap01.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hanami in Takayama 花見" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hanami-in-takayama">Hanami in Takayama 花見</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Sakura trees were already in full bloom when I visited Nagasaki 4 weeks ago, and now that it's getting warm in Takayama, they've begun to bloom here, too.</p><p>Taking apart the word <span class='ja'>花見</span>, we have <span class='ja'>花</span>, or Hana, which means flower, and <span class='ja'>見</span>, or mi, which is watching, looking, or viewing.  So <span class='ja'>花見</span>, or Hanami, literally translates as Flower Viewing, but refers more directly to observing, and enjoying Sakura trees as the reach full bloom.</p><p>Earlier this week was probably the peak of Sakura season, but it wasn't until yesterday that the weather was actually good enough to go outside and enjoy the beautiful trees with a bright sunlit sky.</p><p>The next few photos are from some of my elementary schools in Takayama.  I took some photos during the lunch recess while all the students were running around.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5656.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5671.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5978.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5984.webp" /></p><p>They looked perfect last week, but they still look just as beautiful today.

You might remember from a previous post that <span class='ja'>龍</span>, or ryuu, is Japanese for dragon.  The kanji <span class='ja'>臥</span>, or ga, means bending down, or bowing.  </p><p>The priest renamed the tree Ga-ryuu-zakura because the expanding branches of the trees looked like a winding dragon.  And with the tree being so old, many branches give the appearance of bowing.  So I think the name Bowing Dragon Sakura makes sense. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5687.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5752.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5737.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140423_hanami/IMG_5763.webp" /></p><p>Above is a beautiful tree from directly in front of the Miya station entrance.</p><p>Garyuuzakura is right next to the train station in Miya, which has plenty of parking.

| April 21, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On April 19th and 20th, the city of Hida Furukawa celebrates its annual spring festival.  Much like several other festivals in Gifu, the neighborhoods of Furukawa while bring out their festival floats and display them around town for everyone to see.</p><p>The Furukawa festival has a yin and yang, a calm and active side.  During the day, all the floats and performances are meant to represent the calmness and stillness of the Furukawa festival.  It's meant to be relaxing.  The festival at night is meant to represent the chaotic active side.</p><p>But, during the day, there are 9 floats displayed around the neighborhoods.  Unlike the Takayama Festival, the Furukawa Festival is very competitive.  The festival at night is very very competitive, but even during the day, neighborhoods try to sway crowds of tourists over to their corners.  They put on their marionette shows, and have other performances throughout the day.  </p><p>Originally, I think it was meant to gain favor from the gods, and that meaning probably still stands.  I think building a bigger surrounding crowd is just a means to that end.  I think they also do it for bragging rights, though.</p><p>These performances happen at irregular times throughout the day, so it's difficult to plan anything, unless you're moving throughout town all day.  Most of the performances end around 5pm when they start putting the floats away for the evening.</p><p>Many of these floats are nearly identical to the Takayama festival.  They have the same look and name.  Maybe that's just how all the float parades are in Hida?  Each float is maintained by a specific neighborhood group in Furukawa, and they're all within a few blocks of the Furukawa train station.</p><p>____</p><p>I arrived in Furukawa around 3:00, I think.  Even though, it had been warmer in the week, clouds started moving in the day before.  The day was a bit gloomy, and a bit cold, too.  It was still pretty warm during the day, but as the sun set, it started to get a little bit more cold.</p><p>When I arrived, I walked through town and observed all the food and game stands lining the streets, until I saw several of the floats lined up down the streets.  So, I went that way and took a bunch of pictures.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>神楽台</span> / <span class='ja'>かぐらたい</span></b></div><p>Proving my point about identical floats is the first float on the list: the Kagura-tai.  Which is also the first float in the Takayama Festival, with the same name and look.  It is maintained by the Mukaimachi group (<span class='ja'>向町組</span>).</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清曜台</span> / <span class='ja'>せいようたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img

| April 17, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the biggest attractions to Takayama every year is the Takayama Matsuri, or Takayama Festival.  It's held twice a year.  For 2 days in April, and 2 days in October.  Both festivals are basically the same, but take place in different parts of the town, with different neighborhoods, and celebrating a different shrine.  On April 14th and 15th every year, Takayama celebrates the <b>Sanno Matsuri</b>, or more commonly called, The Spring Festival.  On October 9th and 10th, they celebrate the <b>Hachiman Matsuri</b>, or simply Fall Festival.</p><p>This year, those dates fell on a Monday and a Tuesday, so most people in Takayama couldn't attend the major events held during the day.  Some schools let their students go around Noon on Monday, but the teachers still stayed in school and attended meetings and such.</p><p>The festival has 4 specific events held throughout the two days.  In addition, many other business open to the public, especially the Sake breweries downtown.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>屋台曵き揃え</span> / <span class='ja'>やたいひきそろえ</span></b></div><p>Yatai Hikisoroe means Float Gathering.</p><p>The center pieces of the Takayama Matsuri are the floats, or yatai.  Each festival has its legion of floats.  This is pretty much the only time in the entire year they're taken out of their garages and displayed around town.  There are 12 floats in the Spring Festival, and on both days you can view the floats from 9:30 to 4:00 in designated areas in town.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>からくり奉納</span> / <span class='ja'>からくりほうのう</span></b></div><p>Karakuri Hounou basically means marionette presentation.</p><p>Some of the float have complicated internal wiring that controls a mechanical doll sitting on the front of the float.  There are 4 times throughout the Spring Festival when 3 doll-controlling floats will gather in the square in front of the Takayama Shrine, and perform their presentations.  Several neighborhood members perform music, and the dolls come alive and dance on the float.</p><p>These happened during the day, so I was unable to attend this year.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>御巡幸</span> / <span class='ja'>ごじゅんこう</span></b></div><p>Gojunkou is the daily parade from the Sanno Shrine and through the streets of Takayama.  This happens on both days in the afternoon.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>夜祭</span> / <span class='ja'>よまつり</span></b></div><p>This is the main event of the Festival each year, the Yoru Matsuri, or Night Festival.  After sundown on the first night, the floats are illuminated with lanterns, and paraded through the streets of Takayama.  They start near the Takayama Shrine, and are pulled through the old streets, Kokubunji, and then back to the start, making one lap.</p><p>For this year, it was the only part of the festival I was able to attend.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4520.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4520.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4520.webp" /></p><p>Many other people were there, too.  The Takayama Board of Tourism does a great job pulling a few thousand people into Takayama for these festivals.  There's plenty of Japanese tourists, and plenty of foreign tourists, too.  I hadn't heard of Takayama before I came here, but they have a pretty strong presence in some foreign tour books and programs.  Everyone I asked how they heard about the festival said it was on their tour schedule, or came recommended from some else who had already toured through here.</p><p>Anyway, people started gathering around 6:00, but the parade didn't start going until about 7:00.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4527.webp" /></p><p>The parade started with a dragon dance.  Then after, all 12 brightly lit floats were pulled through the streets.</p><p><i>By the way, the following information is mostly taken from the Takayama website, and the pamphlets handed out around town during the festival.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Float 1: <span class='ja'>神楽台</span> / <span class='ja'>かぐらたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4552.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4552.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4552.webp" /></p><p>Kaguratai is the first float in the parade, and has always been first since the very beginning of the festival.  Like many of the float names, the 'tai' suffix is shorthand for yatai, or float.  The term 'kagura' stands for god's entertainment, or dance for the gods.  Throughout Japan, many cities and villages have their own renditions of kagura.  </p><p>Two men stand on both sides of the Kaguratai and pound the massive drum that the preceding dragons move to.  It's also known as "The Way Opener" and signals the front of the parade and introduces all the oncoming floats.</p><p>Yoroku Taniguchi was an artist from the late Edo period, and he made many improvements to the floats in the parade.  In 1854, he improved Kaguratai, and to this day his descendants still own and maintain the float for this parade.  Much of his art is displayed around town, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 2: <span class='ja'>三番叟</span> / <span class='ja'>さんばそう</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4561.webp" /></p><p>Second in the parade is Sanbasou, and prominently has a marionette on the front of the float.  Sanbasou comes in right behind Kaguratai because the marionette's dance matches the rhythm of the drums, and the Kabuki style of the music.</p><p>In the Karakuri Hounou, the puppet dance, this marionette is the first to perform.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 3: <span class='ja'>石橋台</span> / <span class='ja'>しゃっきょうたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4581.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4581.webp" /></p><p>Shakkyoutai is third in the parade, and the second float to showcase a marionette, though the marionette was removed for the Night Festival.  It also performs second in the Karakuri Hounou.</p><p>Shakkyou stands for Stone Bridge, but I don't think that has anything to do with the design.  I think the marionette is supposed to be a merchant.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 4: <span class='ja'>龍神台</span> / <span class='ja'>りゅうじんたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4593.webp" /></p><p>Ryuujintai is number four.  It's also the third and final float to perform in the Karakuri Hounou.  Throughout the Night Festival, the operators in the float would reset the puppet, and re-perform the Karakuri dance spewing confetti while its limbs flail about.</p><p><span class='ja'>龍</span>, or Ryuu, means dragon.  Jin typically means person, but with <span class='ja'>神</span> as the kanji, it stands for god.  Ryuujin is Dragon God, and that's the name of the puppet.  It performs the dragon dance.  And the float has markings of dragons all over it.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 5: <span class='ja'>恵比須台</span> / <span class='ja'>えびすたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4612.webp" /></p><p>Ebisutai is the one on the right, behind Ryuujintai.</p><p>While Ebisutai became part of the parade as early as 1764, the modern design of the float was updated and improved by Yoroku Taniguchi.  He carved ten lions in the wood around the lower part of the float.  Each face of the lion is different and meant to show human expressions.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 6: <span class='ja'>崑崗台</span> / <span class='ja'>こんこうたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4639.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4639.webp" /></p><p>Konkoutai gets its name from a gold mine in China.  Much of the decoration on the float originates in China, or is made to seem so, especially the tapestry.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 7: <span class='ja'>五台山</span> / <span class='ja'>ごたいさん</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4641.webp" /></p><p>Godaisan is a very regal float.  It's meant to be noble and have an air about itself that represents grace and statehood.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 8: <span class='ja'>鳳凰台</span> / <span class='ja'>ほうおうたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4679.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4679.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4679.webp" /></p><p>According to the website, Hououtai is known for its detailed construction.  The Halberd on the top of the roof should be comparable to the Gion Floats in Kyoto.  Though, in the image above, you can't really see the massive blade.  I think they removed it.</p><p>Also, this float was destroyed by fire in 1834 and later reconstructed.  Perhaps the metal blade on the top acted as a lightning rod.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 9: <span class='ja'>琴高台</span> / <span class='ja'>きんこうたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4690.webp" /></p><p>Much like a few other floats, Kinkoutai was reconstructed and redesigned by artist Yoroku Taniguchi.  The tapestry surrounding the cabin of the float has a golden swimming carp, and many other golden carp are carved into the wooden pillars.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 10: <span class='ja'>麒麟台</span> / <span class='ja'>きりんたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4758.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4758.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4758.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4737.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4737.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4737.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4775_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4775_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4775_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4775_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4775_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4789.webp" /></p><p>According to the website, the designs on the Kirintai are thought to be one of Takayama's most distinctive masterpieces of art.  It's certainly the one I remember the most for some reason.  And it was sitting there in front me for the longest time, so I was able to get a lot of photos of it, too.</p><p>Also, Kirin is Japanese for Giraffe.  Which follows that all the animal designs on the float are giraffes.  I wonder if it's the tallest float...</p><div class='title'><b>Float 11: <span class='ja'>青龍台</span> / <span class='ja'>せいりゅうたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4800.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4800.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4800.webp" /></p><p>This is the Seiryuutai.  Again, ryuu is Japanese for dragon.  The kanji for sei is ao, which is Blue.  So, Blue Dragon.  But, that's the literal translation.  It's english name is the Azure Dragon, and in Japan it represents one of the four guardian spirits of Kyoto.  Seiryuu protects the east side of Kyoto.  The famous Kiyomizu-dera is a shrine detected to this dragon.  In addition to representing east, Seiryuu also represents Spring of the four seasons.  There's also the five elements, too.  Seiryuu represents wood.</p><p>The most distinct feature of this float is the castle-like roof on the top complete with golden dolphins on each side, which doesn't really go with the Seiryuu name…  The wood carvings on the float show the life of a peony flower from birth to death.</p><div class='title'><b>Float 12: <span class='ja'>大國台</span> / <span class='ja'>たいこくたい</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4815.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4815.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4823.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4823.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4823.webp" /></p><p>The final float in the Night Festival in Daikokutai.  Dai means big, and Koku means country, but uses the old outdated kanji, which makes sense given how old and historic these floats are.  This float was constructed in 1796.</p><p>Daikoku-ten is actually one of the seven gods of fortune in Japan.  He is the god of great darkness, and is derived from Shiva in Hinduism.  He is associated with an old Japanese custom known as "theft of fortune."  Basically, you were awarded good luck if you were able to steal religious symbols without being caught.  He is also associated with wealth of food and kitchen, too, and is often seen seated near bales of rice.</p><p>Anyway, this float was actually "adopted" from another community, rather than native to the Takayama festival.</p><div class='title'><b>End of Parade</b></div><p>I was actually really close to the starting position of the parade, so the last float passed by me just a little bit after 8:00.  The crowds around me began to disperse, but the parade was far from over.  This was merely the first leg of its journey through Takayama.  It was simply the first edge of a square.</p><p>I started walking back through the old streets.  As I came to the larger streets, I could look down to my right and see the floats going through the crowds of people.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4831.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4831.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4831.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4863.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4863.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140414_matsuri/IMG_4863.webp" /></p><p>Firstly above you can Hououtai in the distance.  And in the second photo, I think that's Ebisutai.</p><p>It was so weird.  It felt like I was standing there for a long time, taking photos and watching the floats go by.  And it only took a 5 minute walk going back home to completely catch up to the front of the parade passing by a crowd seeing the float for the first time.  It is also got SO dark SO fast that it was hard to believe it was only 8:00.</p><p>It was also interesting to see all the random places opened up at night.  As I walked home, I came across a World War II memorabilia museum.  It was complete with a motorcycle, several machine guns, and tons of uniforms from both Japan and the US.  I didn't even know that place was there!  I wonder how often that place is actually open.</p><p>Anyway, that's the parade.  The weather was absolutely perfect.  A cool 50 or 60 degrees with clear, clean, pure, crisp air.  The following days were a little warmer, but were very hazy, and felt polluted. :(<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Intro Lesson - Self Intro and Name Tags" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lessons-h26-special-self-intro-and-name-tags">Intro Lesson - Self Intro and Name Tags</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All the students already know me, so doing another Self Introduction is really redundant, and doesn't really make sense.  I still wanted an introductory lesson, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Self Intro Quiz</b></div><p>All these students already know me, and I've told them plenty about myself.  I wanted to see just how much they remember.  I came up with 10 questions, but really only had time for 5 or 6 in class.  I split the class into 3 or 4 groups, depending on class size.  I'd ask the kids a question, and let them talk amongst themselves to come up with the answer.</p><p>I asked the following:</p><p><i>How many brothers and sisters do I have?</i> / <span class='ja'>兄弟は何人</span>？ / <span class='ja'>きょうだいはなんにん</span>？<br/><i>How tall am I?</i> / <span class='ja'>身長は何センチ</span>？ / <span class='ja'>しんちょうはなんセンチ</span>？<br/><i>How old am I?</i> / <span class='ja'>何歳</span>？ / <span class='ja'>なんさい</span>？<br/><i>What's my favorite animal?</i> / <span class='ja'>一番好きな動物は何ですか</span>？ / <span class='ja'>いちばんすきなどぼつ</span>…<br/><i>What's my favorite Japanese food?</i> / <span class='ja'>一番好きな日本の食べ物は何ですか</span>？ / <span class='ja'>いちばんすきなにほんのたべもの</span>…</p><p>Several times, some students would be right, but the majority would overrule them.  I didn't award them any points for that, but those kids were certainly smug, and the kids started listening to them after the fact.</p><p>Overall, most students didn't really remember the details.  Some students remembered correctly, but most team scores were either 1 or 2 correct out of 5.  One of my classes remembered really well, and each team had 3 or 4 correct at the end, and wanted to keep playing. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Nametags</b></div><p>For the last year, I was able to memorize all the students names (both first and last) in my Junior High.  Sure, I see them all 3 times a week, but what really helped me learn their names was their English name tags.  Someone before me printed a bunch of them out, laminated them, and put a safety pin on the back.  Passing them out each class, and calling on students by name in each class, was an amazing help.</p><p>After 8 months, I knew only a couple of names from my elementary schools.  So, one of my goals for this year is to learn as many names as I can.  And making name tags should definitely help that.</p><p>Also, I wanted to make the name tags myself, so everyone single one was the exact same style, and I could read the name at a glance.  If the students made their own name tags, they'd be poorly written, possibly misspelled, and may not even be their complete name.  Sure, I would have some control over that, but it would eat into class time.</p><div class='title'><b>Creation</b></div><p>To create the name tags, I followed a similar process used for those name tags already made in my Junior High.  As usual, I used the Century Gothic font because the a's and g's are both written that how they're taught.  Plus, I'm pretty sure the text book uses Century Gothic, too.</p><p>I fit 6 names on a page, printed all those out on pure white paper, laminated them, cut them out, and then punched two holes in the tops.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4431.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4431.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4431.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4432.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4432.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4432.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4433.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4433.webp" /></p><p>All of this step used office supplies, so there was no additional cost from me.</p><p>I did spend money for the yarn, though.  I didn't see anything at the schools that would work well for string and be in such massive supply.  Maybe the Home Ec room would've had something…  But, I wanted a bunch of colors, and I knew that the craft store would have it.  </p><p>I bought 6 colors, and each ball of yarn is about 60m.  I figured that each name tag would probably use about half a meter.  So thats 120 tags per ball.  6 balls should definitely cover my needs.</p><p>Each ball was 350<span class='ja'>円</span>, so the bill was a little more than 2100<span class='ja'>円</span> after they added tax.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4463.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4463.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4424.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4423.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4423.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4426.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4426.webp" /></p><p>I ended up cutting the string a bit longer than half a meter, but I had plenty to spare.</p><div class='title'><b>Cost</b></div><p>I spent about $20 on the yarn, but the real cost is time.</p><p>Again, I teach at 3 elementary schools.  2 of the schools only have 1 class per grade, and I teach them all.  The other school has 2 classes, and I teacher 4th grade and up.  Adding things up, I teach 18 unique classes, and needed to create name tags for each of the students.  All in all, I created 550 name tags, plus another 20 including all the Homeroom Teachers.</p><p>Typing all the names into the computer took quite a while.  There was plenty of proofreading, as well as asking teachers for English names for the non-Japanese students.</p><p>The laminating machine runs pretty slow, so laminating all those name cards takes a while.  I multitasked with the paper cutter, to try and maximize my time.  </p><p>I did individually cut each card, just to make sure there were no screw-ups.  If there's a more precise way of cutting huge piles of papers, that could save a lot of time.</p><p>My hole puncher could only handle 6 cards at once, so that was yet another time bottleneck.  There could certainly be a more efficient way of doing that, too.</p><p>And then cutting all the string, and tying each name tag individually takes time, too.</p><p>All in all, it probably took me about <b>1 1/2 hours</b> or <b>2 hours</b> to complete name tags for <b>each class</b>.  With 18 classes, that's a total of up to <b>36 hours</b>.  It wasn't too bad, though.  I didn't do all of this at once, just a little bit each day.  I watched a bunch of movies and internet videos while stringing the name tags at home, too.</p><p>But!  There are exactly what I wanted. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4429.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140410_nametags/IMG_4429.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>"Business Card" Game</b></div><p>This game was introduced by another ALT in Takayama.  The basic concept is that students introduce themselves to each other, then they switch identities.  In this context, after introducing themselves, the students will switch name tags, and now they'll introduce themselves as whatever name tag they have.  I added some difficulty with the ５<span class='ja'>年生</span> and ６<span class='ja'>年生</span> by also making them say something they liked, and then remembering that when introducing themselves as that person.</p><p>Overall, the kids thought this was hilarious, and loved introducing themselves as someone else.  The students did have a little difficulty remembering the names and liked things.  Some of the younger students have some difficulty reading the name tags.</p><p>But, it was fine.  Everyone seemed engaged and had fun. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>Overall, these classes went pretty damn well.  It was great to start the year on a high point with everyone communicating with each other, smiling and having fun.  All the students were very engaged in both the quiz and the game.</p><p>Definitely a success. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Battleship Island - Gunkanjima 軍艦島" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gunkanjima-2">Battleship Island - Gunkanjima 軍艦島</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 1, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At it's peak of operation, this island was the most densely population place on earth, and still holds that title today.  This is <b>Hashima</b>, or, by its nickname, "Battleship Island".  It exists in the Sea of Japan just 15km west of Nagasaki City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" /></p><p>Coal was first discover on the island in 1810, and a small mining operation existed.  The first official mineshaft opened in 1887.  Production on the island didn't really turn into a massive settlement until the Mitsubishi bought the island, and increased it's magnitude.  At the height of its operation, the population of the island was around 5300 people.</p><p>After World War II, and the adoption of petroleum, people began to use coal less and less.  So with the demand waning, the island became more and more obsolete.  On January 15th, 1974, closed the last operating mineshaft.  And on April 20th, the last residents of the Hashima left the island forever.  The island remained abandoned and unkept after that.</p><p>In 2002, Mistubishi relinquished ownership to Takashima-machi.  And with a government restructuring in 2005, it now became part of Nagasaki City.  After years of work, planning, and construction, tourism finally opened on the island almost 35 years to the day it closed down, April 22nd, 2009.</p><p>May 2010 was the last time I had visited Nagasaki.  I went with Dave, and we met Ikuko who was very insistent that we visit this place.  So, we did. ^_^   Unfortunately, the weather was not very good, and I wasn't in a good position to take many good photos.  Here are the photos I was able to take: <a href="/old/v7/gunkanjima" title="/gunkanjima">May 19th, 2010</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Preservation</b></div><p>Up until Nagasaki's acquisition of the island, no attempt to upkeep or preserve the island had taken place.  It suffered from weather, rotting, and general decay for over 30 straight years.  There is massive concern from the city about the safety of the island, especially inside the decaying building.</p><p>This is why it took 4 years, with delays, to open the island to regular tourism.  And then, even on the island, tourists are closely watched, and the areas you can visit are very very minimal.  On the island, the walkway is as far the edge of the island as possible.  Far away from any of the residentially buildings, and any collateral damage if one of the buildings should collapse.</p><p>Nagasaki wants to preserve the buildings and other structures on the island, but the cost is too high for the city.  Constant tourism brings in money to help that, but it's still not enough.</p><p>In Nagasaki, right now, there's a massive campaign to have Hashima, and several other parts of Nagasaki, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  If successful, they should receive funding to further preserve the island, and make it even more accessible to tourists.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Tourism</b></div><p>So, last Friday, March 28th, was the second time I have been to the island.  The last time was May 10th, 2010, and the procedure was completely identical as it is today.  You buy passage on a boat from Nagasaki Harbor.  You take a cruise to the island.  The boat circles around the island for a little bit.  Then you land on the island, and a tour guide shows off the parts of the island you can see, and talks about the history.  You walk around on the very cornered off part of the island away from the decaying buildings.  And then you go back to the harbor.</p><p>Unlike the first time I visited, the weather was absolutely perfect.  Clear skies, clear water.  Absolutely beautiful.</p><p>Below is the front of the island which served as the actual mining facility.  This is where everyone worked, and where ships would load coal, and drop off supplies for the island.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3794_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3817.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3817.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3817.webp" /></p><p>Above is Hashima JHS and Hashima ES.  The first four floors of the building served as the elementary school, and the top 3 were the Junior high school.  While a school existed on the island before, the finished construction of this building is 1958 allowed the residents to consolidate all the schooling into one single building.  Though, the Kindergarden was still in a different connected building.  In 1970, the built a gymnasium, but it has since collapsed.</p><p>Right next to the school, and housing the kindergarden on the roof, was the most populous residential building on the island, No. 65.  It served as home for 317 families.</p><p>Below is the back of the island off limits to tourists.  It contains all the residential buildings and is the most dangerous part of the surface of the island.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3895.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3895.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3893.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3893.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3893.webp" /></p><p>Above is building No. 51, which served mainly as residential.  It housed 40 families.</p><p>Again, on the island, tourism is only permitted near the mining facility and far away from any of the more interesting buildings.  But you can still see some neat ruins.</p><p>In the second photo below, the building overseeing most of the island was where management lived on the island.  It was the only building on the island that had private baths.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3923.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3923.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3923.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3932.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3932.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3970.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3970.webp" /></p><p>And above is the closest you actually get to a residential building.  This was building No. 30 and was the second most populous building on the island for 140 families.</p><p>Here's the same place from 4 years ago.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100519_gunkanjima/IMG_7962_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100519_gunkanjima/IMG_7962_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100519_gunkanjima/IMG_7962_stitch.webp" /></p><p><br/>Anyway, it's a neat little escapade to take if you find yourself in Nagasaki, especially on a clear beautiful day.  Tourism is rather lucrative though, so you do need a reservation in advance.  It might be a little expensive, though, at about 4000<span class='ja'>円</span>, but I think it's interesting, and worth it.</p><p>And with Nagasaki campaign for UNESCO, the tourism on the island could completely change in the future.  ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Changes around Nagasaki" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/changes-around-nagasaki">Changes around Nagasaki</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I was a study abroad student, and I lived in Nagasaki City.  Over the course of the those years, I've come back to visit a few times.  Each time I visit, many things have stayed the same.

Many of the major and minor arcades we used to visit on the regular basis were gone on my subsequent visits to Nagasaki.  I can't really say why..  Maybe it was because of the global recession, or the continued rise of mobile games in Japan, or just the stagnation of the Japanese video game industry.  I dunno..</p><p>Within the first block of Hamanomachi there was a Sega arcade, I went to on a frequent basis.  This place is pretty easy to identify because it's a fricken pyramid.  They had some bitchin' retro games, and fighting games on the second floor.  The first floor was full of UFO and Purikura machines.</p><p>Anyway, in 2008, it was gone.

Our beloved Taito Station in Sumiyoshi is no longer in operation.  I think that went out of business before I visited in 2008.  The McDonalds is still totally there, though, which is weird.  The whole building hasn't changed in the last 7 1/2 years, so the top 3 floors must've been vacant all this time.</p><p>Something new we saw in 2010 was Coco Walk: a massive new American style mall near Urakami station that also serves as a bus station.  I have no recollection of what was there before this mall, but it is now a staple of the landscape.  You can clearly see it from Mt. Inasa, too.</p><p>Something else that has changed recently is that Toys R Us in Michinoo is now out of business.  </p><p>So, several things have changed throughout the years, but many things have not.  I remember Nagasaki so well, that I never really pulled out Google Maps to figure out where I was going.  Even using the busses, I remember the areas, and can read the Kanji on the bus stop, that I could figure out what bus to take easily.  I totally remember my bus stop (the bus stop in near Beardo) being <span class='ja'>寺川内</span>.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>There are plenty more changes coming in the future.  Signs near Amu Plaza show Nagasaki City's intention for completely renovating Nagasaki Station.  The train tracks between the station and Urakami station will be completely elevated to elevate traffic and move the actual station away from Amu Plaza.  And then it looks like they plan on building another line going out of the station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" /></p><p>Interesting times ahead.
