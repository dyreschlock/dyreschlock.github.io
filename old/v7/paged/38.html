| June 15, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year has been pretty amazing for gaming.  January saw the release of Mass Effect 2.  February saw the release of Heavy Rain, plus Ace Attorney Edgeworth.  And March saw the release of...  just every other game announced last year.  Final Fantasy XIII, Pokemon Gold/Silver, Yakuza 3, and the Dragon Age Expansion.  So many games were released that I was seriously burned out.</p><p>All 4 of those games are huge time investments, and all were released within 7 days of each other?  Out of the 4, I chose Pokemon.  Not the smartest choice seeing how the game is nothing but level grinding and repetitive battling, in series that doesn't really evolve.  My gaming has come stand still.  So, I have hopes for E3.</p><p>Last year, E3 gave my interest in gaming a jump start.  The end of 2008 really annoyed me with some mediocre titles, and there really wasn't much to look forward to.  Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony each gave me a reason to look towards the future.  Now that I'm down again, I have the same hopes for this coming year.  Maybe something will peak my interest, and snowball into continuous hype.</p><div class='title'><b>The Big 3</b></div><p>Tony has some great summaries of Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony's press conferences for this year on his blog.  Which is here: <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org" title="http://blog.t-kun.org">blog.t-kun.org</a>.  As a condensed version:</p><p><b>Microsoft</b>'s conference was quite boring.  They'd showed off Call of Duty, Metal Rising, Gears 3, and a bunch of Natal (now named Kinect) titles.  They also showed off a redesign model of the 360 shipping to retailers now.</p><p><b>Nintendo</b>'s conference was all about Nostalgia.  There's a new Legend of Zelda, new Donkey Kong Country, new Goldeneye, and a new Kirby game.  Plus, they showed off the Nintendo 3DS, the successor to the DS.</p><p><b>Sony</b>'s conference was pretty disappointing.  They announced new ad campaigns, which is useless to gamers.  They focused on 3D technology, Playstation Plus, Playstation Move.  They showed off a couple games including Little Big Planet 2, Dead Space 2, and unveiled PS3 Twisted Metal!  But NO mention of The Last Guardian, or anything Trico.</p><p>All in all, Nintendo really stole the show.  But there was a little bit in all the conferences that has gotten me excited.  Plus other stuff from the show floor.  Here are some specific thoughts about what's being going on at E3:</p><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Rising</b></div><p>I'm not the biggest Metal Gear fan, but MGS3 and 4 are definitely two of the finest games I've ever played.  I love both those titles, and I'm definitely interested in the next console game in that series.  During Microsoft's press conference Hideo Kojima took the stage, and introduced a new trailer which included gameplay: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvrbUWEKRnk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvrbUWEKRnk">Youtube Link</a></p><p>The trailer shows Raiden cutting enemies and pieces of the environment in any direction at will.    Towards the end Raiden pushes an enemy in the air, and clearly slices through his legs and then again through his arms and torso.  This game looks incredible.</p><p>Although, isn't Metal Gear supposed to be about Espionage?  This gameplay looks badass but it's not covert in the slightest.  I don't know how they plan on fashioning this as a Metal Gear game, when it looks nothing like a Metal Gear game.</p><div class='title'><b>Xbox 360 Redesign</b></div><p>With the on going deluge of crappy Kinect titles, and 360 games I had absolutely no interest in, Microsoft ended their conference with a reveil few people expected.  The redesign of the Xbox 360.  It was somewhat leaked before the conference, but nobody really paid attention to it.</p><p>It's smaller, quiter, and better looking than the 5 year old model.  It has built in Wifi as well, plus a 250 gig harddrive.  Unfortunately, it looks like they've completely gotten rid of the memory card slots, which I frequently use.  But everything else is there.</p><p>The new model costs $300, which is the price of the high-end Xbox 360 right now.  Though, those will drop down to $250.  These new models are shipping now, and will be at retailers by Sunday at the latest.</p><p>It's pretty nice that Microsoft finally got around to redesign their outdated hardware, but almost everyone already has an Xbox.  I kinda want one of these, but I already have one.  Plus, I have a Wifi adapter.  And my Xbox works great.  I don't need a new one.</p><div class='title'><b>Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword</b></div><p>Nintendo wasted no time in their conference, and once the lights dimmed and the new Wii Legend of Zelda illuminated the screens.  Shigeru Miyamoto hopped on stage, and showed off the fully "one-to-one" motions of the Wii mote with Link, which seemed rather janky and about as imprecise as any Wii game.</p><p>Apparently reports from the E3 floor say the game is much easier than how it looked when Miyamoto fumbled on stage, but I don't really want a full motion Wii Legend of Zelda.  Twilight Princess is just about as perfect you can get with their current hardware.  I thought the DS was home to the goofy spin-off Zeldas, and now we have this?</p><p>It does look really pretty though: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5564603/zelda-skyward-sword-is-inspired-bydead-french-painters" title="http://kotaku.com/5564603/zelda-skyward-sword-is-inspired-bydead-french-painters">kotaku article</a></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo 3DS</b></div><p>Back in March, Nintendo officially announced the Nintendo 3DS, a 3D handheld that required no glasses and is poised to be the successor to the DS.  I really need a new Nintendo DS.  My launch edition of the Nintendo DS Lite is beat to shit, and I had planned on purchasing a Nintendo DSi XL.  Nintendo just happened to announce this thing 6 days before its release, so I kept my money.</p><p>The press conference didn't really show much, and they admitted it was hard to actually convey the product over video.  But this thing is the talk of the show.  Twitter is full of people saying it is the best thing Nintendo has ever done.  Apparently the 3DS is an amazing feat you really have to see for yourself.</p><p>Well, I need a new DS and my money was already going to this thing, so I'm definitely in.  All this hype is really just a cherry on the top of a cake of necessity.</p><p>In addition, they announced the return of Kid Icarus premiered on the 3DS.  The game looks like a on-rails shooter that doesn't ever compare to the recent release of Sin and Punishment 2 on the Wii.  Why would they even try to compete with that fantastic game?  I dunno.  I guess it's better than trying to make a side-scrolling metroidvania Kid Icarus.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo Nostalgia</b></div><p>Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus weren't the only franchises getting new titles.  It seems that Nintendo announced or showed a new game for every existing franchise they own.  They announced a new Donkey Kong Country game, which looked pretty good.  An actual new iteration of Goldeneye, which will probably see high numbers of Nintendo online network.  A new Kirby game in the vane of Paper Mario.  They showed much more footage of Metroid Other M, which I'm certainly interested in.</p><p>Nintendo kept the showcase of titles flowing, until their unveil of the 3DS.  But it looks like the 3DS is a nostalgia house of its own.  Many blog articles and reports have showed upcoming releases such as Star Fox 64 on 3DS, Ocarina of Time on 3DS, Metal Gear Solid 3 on 3DS, Kingdom Hearts 1 on 3DS.  It looks like it's setup as a 3D virtual console of some of the best games from the past decade or so.</p><p>Definitely interesting.  Though, I wonder how much all of this will cost...</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 3D</b></div><p>Sony had its own idea of what 3D meant for gaming.  They announced they would be the home for 3D gaming in your living room.  They rationalized since Blu-ray discs hold so much data, developers can easily fit a 3D version of their game on the SAME disc as the regular version.  Plus, a few current titles will be getting 3D updates through software patches.  As such, every single PS3 on the market today is fully 3D compatible and requires no additional purchase at all.</p><p>Oh...  except for a 3D compatible television.  Plus, you'll need some 3D glasses too.  But if you're home entertainment setup is already 3D compatible (which it's not), the Playstation 3 will fit right in.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation Move</b></div><p>Playstation Move was another big highlight for Sony's press conference.  This is their answer to the Wii, and directly inspired by the Wii as well.  You have the Playstation Move Wiimote, and the Playstation Move nunchunk.  The Playstation 3 Eye Camera tracks these movements, and delivers motion controls that actually seem much better than the Wii.</p><p>They showed off a bunch of games I had absolutely no interest in.  But they mentioned that Heavy Rain would be getting an PS Move update.  They also mentioned a Time Crisis game.</p><p>They should've showed off this game:</p><div class='title'><b>Child of Eden</b></div><p>At Ubisoft's press conference on Monday evening, Tetsuya Mizuguchi took the stage and began demonstrated his newest game, Child of Eden.  This Kotaku article has a video:  <a href="http://kotaku.com/5563293/this-is-basically-rez-for-the-playstation-move" title="http://kotaku.com/5563293/this-is-basically-rez-for-the-playstation-move">click</a>.</p><p>That Kotaku article also says that it's a game born from the basic concept as Rez, one of my favorite games ever.  It's an on-rails shooter, where the environment and music flow along with shots fired from your character.  This trailer is absolutely beautiful. ^_^</p><p>It's announced for the Playstation Move and Xbox's Kinect.  One reporter asked if you could still use a standard controller, to which Mizuguchi replied "yes", so I guess it doesn't really matter if you have a PS Move.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 2</b></div><p>Premiered online a couple days before E3, shown during EA's press conference and continued into Sony's, Visceral Games gave a glimpse as to what Dead Space 2 is all about.  In 2008, Dead Space blew me away with its amazing graphics, SOUND, and amazing environments.  Even though it borrowed quite a bit from other established games, it really proved they knew what they were doing.</p><p>I'm pretty excited for Dead Space 2, and interested to see what sort of exclusivity deal they had with Sony.  I'm quite delighted by what they actually announced.</p><p>Dead Space 2 had a limited edition release for the Playstation 3 which includes an HD, Playstation Move compatible version of Dead Space Extraction.  Dead Space Extraction was released as a Wii Exclusive earlier this year.  And while it was the greatest game ever, and really didn't fit with the tone of Dead Space 1, and was released on the WRONG console, I was still interested in it.  I played some of it at PAX last year, I found it enjoyable on its own.</p><p>I planned on buying it for Wii when it hit less than $20, but now that a BETTER version is coming for a console I care about...  I'm all in.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation Move consideration</b></div><p>Now there's 3 games for Playstation 3 that are Playstation Move compatible that I actually care about, and plan on owning in the upcoming year.  With the Playstation Move showcase, Sony also announced it's pricey strategy.  A single Playstation Move Wii Mote costs $50, while an additional nunchunk is $30.  Nintendo prices their Wii controllers for the same price.  Plus, I already own a Playstation 3 Camera for some reason.</p><p>If I only need a single Playstation Move Wii Mote, then why not?  I probably will get one.  $50 isn't THAT bad.  An extra $30 for a nunchunk might need more consideration, but who knows.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest of Sony</b></div><p>I find it really annoying that they didn't mention ANYTHING about The Last Guardian.  They spent so much time on their stupid advertising campaigns, which mean nothing to us, and completely ignored anything from Team ICO.  It doesn't sound like they even have anything on the show floor regarding it either.</p><p>I don't really care about Killzone 3, or Little Big Planet 2, or Final Fantasy XIV.  They finally gave Gran Turismo 5 a date (November 2nd), and (later) announced a collector's edition which looks worthless.</p><p>Their big reveal of the day was the HIGHLY anticipated announcement of PS3 Twisted Metal.  After years of denying rumors and avoiding questions, David Jaffe took the stage and showed us what he'd been working on.</p><p>I missed most of the demo, but what I saw was a shit load of players battling in a massive team deathmatch mode.  It looked pretty fun, just like the hay-day of car combat multiplayer games.</p><div class='title'><b>So far</b></div><p>Even though I was pretty down, they are definitely some titles I'm looking forward to.  Metal Gear Rising, Dead Space 2, Child of Eden, Nintendo 3DS, Metroid Other M...  Plus there are some games I haven't looked into as much, such as Dead Rising 2, Castlevania Lords of the Shadow, and that new XBLA Castlevania.</p><p>Playstation Move will probably end up in my home with games like Heavy Rain, Child of Eden, Dead Space Extraction, and maybe that Time Crisis game, too.  Microsoft's Natal/Kinect doesn't interest me at all.  Dance Central looked kinda fun, but everything else looks horrible.</p><p>It should be an interesting Christmas Season, much like last year. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Visiting Fukuoka 福岡" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/visiting-fukuoka">Visiting Fukuoka 福岡</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 7, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>April 8th</b></div><p>About a month, Blizzard announced <a href="/old/v7/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition" title="/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition">release details</a> for Starcraft II.  A couple hours afterward Amazon listed the Collector's Edition for sale, and I preordered my copy.  I was excited.  I logged into battle.net and looked around.</p><div class='title'><b>April 10th</b></div><p>Two days later, I got an email from Blizzard saying that my WOW account has been suspended because I had a virus on my computer.  Or something to that effect...</p><p><em>"An investigation of the World of Warcraft account DYRESCHLOCK has produced evidence that the computer(s) used to play the account are infected by a virus, Trojan or keylogger.</em></p><p><em>"To protect your privacy and security, we have temporarily disabled the account for a 24 hour period. During this time, we highly recommend that you follow the below steps to protect yourself and the account from unauthorized third party access."</em> -Blizzard</p><p>Some might find it odd that I even have a WOW account to begin with...  But what I find more odd is that not only haven't I played WOW in over two years, my account hasn't been active since I quit. I shrugged off the email since it was absurd.</p><div class='title'><b>April 12</b></div><p>Two days later, I get another email from Blizzard saying they've closed my account for violating their Terms of Use.</p><p><em>"This account was closed because one or more characters were identified exchanging, or contributing to the exchange of, in-game property (items or gold) for "real-world" currency. This exchange process negatively impacts the World of Warcraft game environment by detracting from the value of the in-game economy."</em></p><p>Apparently my inactive character was trading gold on eBay?  While still being odd, this posed a great problem:  My Battle.net account is now closed.  I can't log in or do anything now. :/</p><p>The bottom of the email said that if I had any disputes, go to this page: <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=exploitfaq&amp;rhtml=true" title="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=exploitfaq&amp;rhtml=true">http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?tag=exploitfaq</a>.</p><p>For the most part it says if I have not violated the terms of use, and have never given away my login information, contact the Support Team.  I went to the Support Team page, filled out their form, and wrote a description of my account closure.</p><div class='title'><b>April 14th</b></div><p>Two days go by and I receive another email from Blizzard stating that they have determined my account was <em>"accessed by someone not authorized to do so by the World of Warcraft Terms of Use"</em>.  Well, at least they no longer believe I was screwing around on my inactive account.  Unfortunately, my account is still closed and I must go through the process of reactiving it.</p><p>The email sends a link to a PDF on how to reactivate my account: <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf" title="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf">http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf</a></p><p>I need to fill out this form, sign it, and send it to Blizzard along with a photocopy of an official government form of ID.  Alternatively, I could scan my Driver's License and email it instead, but I don't have a scanner.</p><p>Since this sounded like a lot of work, I just left it as a problem for my future self to deal with.</p><div class='title'><b>April 22nd</b></div><p>About a week later, Blizzard started handing out Starcraft II Beta codes to anyone who preordered the game.  I got an email from Amazon in the morning with my very own Beta code!  Whoo!  I can play Starcraft II right now!  Oh wait...  Thanks to the laziness of my past self, my Battle.net account is still closed.</p><p>On the way home, I stopped at Kinkos and photocopied my Driver's License.  When I got home, I filled out the form, packed everything into an envelope and shipped it off to Blizzard.</p><div class='title'><b>April 30th</b></div><p>Yet another week later, I received an email from Blizzard saying my account has been reactivated and my password has been reset!  I was out of town that weekend, so I was reading the email on my phone.</p><p>When I got back to my apartment, I powered up my computer and clicked the reactivation link in the email, but it had expired.  I tried reseting my password on Battle.net, but I wouldn't receive another reactivation email.  I tried a couple times, and each time it said it would send an email and follow the link inside.  I would receive nothing.</p><p>So, I waited.  Maybe it's backed up, and I'd receive those emails over night?  The next day, I received nothing.  Nor the following day.</p><div class='title'><b>May 5th</b></div><p>On Wednesday, I decided to try again.  Why not?  Oh hey, it worked this time.  I got the email.  I followed the link.  And my Battle.net account has been fully reactivated!  huzzah.  I entered my Beta code, and Starcraft II Beta appeared in my games list.  Battle.net gives you a tiny 2.6 mb file, which downloads the full installer for Starcraft II which is about 1.46 gigs.</p><p>My computer does not like the way Blizzard downloads files to my computer.  The Downloader would run for about 10 or 20 minutes and crash my computer with the Blue Hardware Failure Screen.  It would boot up just fine, start downloading, and in another 10 or 20 minutes, BAM, blue screen.</p><p>This happened for about 3 hours until my computer finally finished downloading the whole thing.  After all the hiccups, the installer ran perfectly fine, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Patching</b></div><p>I immediately ran Starcraft II, but...  there's a flood of patches that I need to download and install.  And I need to download and install each individual patch.  Which is absurd.</p><p>First off, I just finished downloading the full installer from your servers.  Why wasn't the application I installed on my computer fully patched to begin with?  You already control the file I just downloaded.  I wasn't installing this from a CD or an old installer I downloaded months ago.  I JUST downloaded the file.  Any download service such as PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, etc already does this.</p><p>Secondly, Why do I need to download each individual patch at a time?  Why aren't all these patches condensed into a single update?  Again, every single modern download service already does this.  Why doesn't Blizzard?</p><p>I don't get it...</p><p>Also, my computer hates these patches just as much as the initial installer, so my computer downloads half a patch and crashes.</p><div class='title'><b>Finally</b></div><p>One month of pain, and Starcraft II is finally running on my machine.  Upon startup it auto-detecting the graphical capabilities of my machine and set everything to the lowest settings. ^_^</p><p>It runs quite well though.  I'm actually surprised how well it runs after all the headaches of getting the thing setup.  The music studders a little bit, but that's about it for bugs.</p><p>There's not much to say about the game itself other than "yes, it's Starcraft."  It's a smoother, graphically updated version of the game with a couple new additions.  The graphics are pretty.  The music is catchy.</p><p>I absolutely suck at this game, but if you want to battle me feel free to add me as a friend.  ^_^  I like that they have 2 friend lists in the game.  One for Battle.net accounts and one for player accounts.  I can easily split those between people I know in real life (aka Friends), and other players I meet in the game.</p><p>So, If I know you in real life, just search for my Battle.net account using my main email address.  Otherwise, my player account is DyreSchlock.DyreSchlock.  I might change that to Schlock.Dyre to remove the redundancy.</p><div class='title'><b>Battle.net Account</b></div><p>I still have no actual idea why my Battle.net was closed.  Maybe they searched eBay for users with the same name?  I dunno...</p><p>I bought one of these things though:  <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822" title="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822">The Battle.net Authenticator</a>, which is just an RSA key fob.  I wanted to buy one of these anyways, but I was waiting for a Starcraft II design.  I bought one immediately though, since I don't really want to go through the process of reactiviting my account again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Music Week in the Midwest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/music-week-in-the-midwest">Music Week in the Midwest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Video Games Live is headlined by seasoned video game music composers Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall who bring their compositions of popular video game franchises to your "local" orchestra and perform them.</p><p>This concert is meant to be a celebration of video games and game music.  Tallarico and Wall said that their mission with Video Games Live was to show all generations the legitimacy of games and how they've changes our lives and culture.  And it was a celebration.  This concert attracted all flavors of game enthusiasts from children and families to hipsters to hardcore gamers to casual gamers and to nerds and geeks in general.  There was a wide variety of cliques and cultures in the audience which is really proved their point.  Video Games aren't for some niche demographic, they're for everyone to enjoy.  It was neat to see everyone join together in harmony.</p><p>Here's the set list from the evening:</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. Metal Gear Solid<br/>3. God of War<br/>4. Space Invaders Demonstration<br/>5. History of Video Games<br/>6. Kingdom Hearts<br/>7. Martin Leung performs "Final Fantasy"<br/>8. The Legend of Zelda<br/>Intermission<br/>9. World of Warcraft<br/>10. Super Mario Brothers<br/>11.

One Winged Angel - Final Fantasy VII<br/>2. Castlevania</p><p>Also, I recorded the whole thing since I chose seats with a perfect vantage point.

Distant Worlds</b></div><p>Video Games Live is strikingly similar to another video game themed 'concert' I've been to before entitled Distant Worlds.  Distant Worlds is a concert featuring music solely from Final Fantasy and created by primary Final Fantasy Composer Nobuo Uematsu.  Uematsu has been in charge of music in Final Fantasy since the beginning, and his concerts aren't really so much a celebration of Final Fantasy, but revisiting the music and compassion that made these games so memorable.</p><p>That's really the true division between Video Games Live and Distant Worlds.  Video Games Live's music simply represents a game.  Comparing Video Games Live and Distant Worlds is like comparing the question "Dude, do you remember Super Mario Brothers?" to the question "Do you remember how you felt when Yuna performed her dance for the souls of everyone in her camp?" (or whatever).  Yeah yeah, Super Mario Brothers NES doesn't lend itself well for emotion memorable experiences, but VGL performs music from other games that are such as Legend of Zelda and Metal Gear Solid.  Their performances didn't really engage me with the same emotion and life as any Final Fantasy song performed at Distant Worlds.</p><p>I think the real difference boils down to Video Games Live simply being a cover band.  That's not meant as an insult, but I think their songs are missing what made these games good and memorable to begin with.  In some cases the most memorable parts of these games was not the music.  Like World of Warcraft?  Does that game even have music? And in other cases where the games have a clear memorable melody, it's not best expressed with an orchestra.  Like Guitar Hero with an Orchestra?!  Halo?  In both cases, Tallarico is using an electric guitar.  Yeah, that fits in an orchestra setting.  Though, their Castlevania song is pretty bitchin'</p><p>I think Distant Worlds is a much better performance because the songs are meant to capture and emphasize those emotional experiences, they same way any classic song should.  And with the original composes, Nobou Uematsu, behind it all, he ensures that the essence of the song is in tact and more powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of which...</b></div><p>Distant Worlds started back in 2008 and is still roaming the globe.  I saw them on March 1st 2008 on their first visit to Chicago.  They've already been back through there again.  Probably because it sold out immediately the first time.  They're coming through Chicago for a third time on August 1st, 2010 and tickets go on sale this Thursday.  This time they're performing at Ravina, wherever that is.</p><p><a href="http://ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=details&amp;id=26:ravinia-august-1-2010&amp;Itemid=62" title="http://ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=details&amp;id=26:ravinia-august-1-2010&amp;Itemid=62">Distant Worlds Link</a> - <a href="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=139" title="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=139">Ravina Link</a></p><p>Huzzah!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Starcraft II Collector's Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition">Starcraft II Collector's Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning Blizzard announced its pricing and release details for Starcraft II.  One would say Starcraft II its Blizzard's most anticipated game of ALL TIME, given the success and timeless qualities of Starcraft I.  Blizzard announced the regular retail version at $60, and the Collector's Edition at $100.  Here's a news article from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-starcraft-ii-collector-s-edition-170358.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-starcraft-ii-collector-s-edition-170358.phtml">Destructoid</a>.  Included in the Collector's Edition is an artbook, a comic, a WOW pet, some exclusive profiles for Starcraft II and a fancy USB stick with Starcraft I and its expansion.</p><p>Alone, I think the Collector's Edition is well worth the $100, especially since I no longer have my copy of Starcraft I.  But, given the history of Blizzard's Collector Editions, I would expect this one to sky rocket in value.  OK, so the Burning Crusade Collector's Edition isn't so hot, but sealed copies of the original World of Warcraft Collector's Edition go for over $1000 on ebay.  (<a href="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition+new&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_odkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition&amp;_osacat=0&amp;bkBtn=" title="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition+new&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_odkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition&amp;_osacat=0&amp;bkBtn=">source</a>)</p><p>In addition, people have been selling Beta Keys for Starcraft II on ebay for anywhere between $100 and $200. (<a href="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=starcraft%20ii%20beta&amp;_fln=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&amp;_rdc=1" title="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=starcraft%20ii%20beta&amp;_fln=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&amp;_rdc=1">source</a>)  $200 for a game that you can only for another couple of months!</p><p>Collecting for the purpose of selling is always a gamble, but I bet you could easily sell a sealed copy of Starcraft II Collector's Edition for twice its value after the release of the game.  If you bought two, the game would pay for itself!  The Collector's Edition is up on amazon now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starcraft-II-Wings-Liberty-Collector-2019s-Pc/dp/B002I0JMB8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1270749861&amp;sr=8-6" title="http://www.amazon.com/Starcraft-II-Wings-Liberty-Collector-2019s-Pc/dp/B002I0JMB8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1270749861&amp;sr=8-6">link</a>).  I pre-ordered a single copy for myself, but I'm terribly tempted to buy a second.</p><p>Anyways, those are my evil thoughts on the subject.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-awakening">The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Spring Awakening 2010 was the last one night event, they did before skipping 2011, and having the 2-day festival in 2012.  More on that one here: <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">July 21st, 2012</a>.</p><p>The Headlining lineup for 2010 was <b>Above & Beyond</b>, <b>Benny Benassi</b>, and <b>Second Sun</b> (Live).</p><p>Five and I went there together.  We arrived as opener <b>DJ BeBe</b> was finishing his set.  <b>Erik K</b> took over the opening duties soon after.  Both were fantastic openers. :)</p><p><b>Second Sun</b> were next, and they performed a great live set of their songs.  <b>Benny Benassi</b> was next.  I had not heard his music prior to the night.  He played some rather interesting tracks that really set his set apart from anything I had heard before.  Crazy drops and breaks in the atmosphere.</p><p>But, after seeing them in 2009, I was super excited to see <b>Above & Beyond</b>, and also introduce them to Five. :)  I felt like their 2009 performance at Epic was much more "magical".  At Epic, they felt much more connected to the crowd.  The Congress was just way too big to make that connection.  But they still were fantastic.  Here are thoughts on that event: <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">November 23rd, 2009</a>.</p><p><br/>Here are videos I took of the whole evening: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/paul-oakenfold-epic-minneapois">Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This night was a really great throwback.  Before Paul Oakenfold took the stage, Jack Trash addressed the crowd and talked about The Quest.  </p><p>"Do any of you remember the last time Paul Oakenfold was here?  It was in 2004, back when this place was The Quest.  It was dank, and dirty."</p><p>Aww, The Quest wasn't that bad. :/  But, I definitely remember.
