| February 28, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 10 years ago, I moved to Japan. I didn’t necessarily intend to stay for more than a year or two, but I loved living here and loved teaching students. Teaching had become the most rewarding job I’ve done in my life, so I didn’t want to leave, and it never felt like my time in Japan was complete. Now, this is where I live. A town full of students or parents of students that I’ve helped teach for more than 10 years. And full of friends and connections that I’ve made over the years.</p><p>Now that 10 years has passed, I can apply for Permanent Residence in Japan. In simple terms, Permanent Residence means that I no longer have to renew a work VISA after 3 years and I can buy or build a house. But to me, it means that I’m further established as a part of Japan and don’t intend to leave. It’s the near-equivalent to a Green Card in the US.</p><p>Applying for Permanent Residence is not a simple process of filling out a couple of forms. There are many parts to prove your legal employment, payment of taxes, and contribution to Japan. I spent about a month working on the application back in October, only to have it rejected because I hadn’t lived here a complete 10 years yet. Now, 4 months later, my application is complete and it ended up being 47 pages long.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp"></a></p><p>It was so long that I wrote a Table of Contents describing everything that I included, and sectioned everything into different folders to make it as easy as possible for them to see what I’ve included.</p><p>Here are the table of contents.</p><p>0.      <b>Payment of Fee</b><br/>1.      <b>Application for Permanent Residence</b><br/>2.      <b>Photo</b><br/>3.      <b>Statement of Reason</b><br/>4.      <b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b><br/>5.      <b>Proof of Residence</b><br/>6.      <b>Proof of Employment</b><br/>7.      <b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b><br/>8.      <b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b><br/>9.      <b>Proof of Financial Assets</b><br/>10.    <b>Passport Photo</b><br/>11.    <b>Residence Card Photo</b><br/>12.    <b>Guarantor Information and References</b><br/>13.    <b>Proof of Contributions to Japan</b><br/>14.    <b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b><br/>15.    <b>Application Oath</b></p><p>The instructions for how to apply for permanent residence can be found on the government Immigration website. They are written in <a href="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">English</a> and in <a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">Japanese</a>. My table of contents follows the list of required materials from that page.</p><p>Even though, they have an English version that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to figure out what to do. These instructions are machine translated, and you still need to understand what they’re saying in Japanese because of the specific names for forms, and the specific departments and locations you need to visit. There’s a lot of running around involved getting all the correct documents, so I have detailed everything I did to build my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Payment of Fee</b></div><p>0.      <span class='ja'>手数料</span><br/>This is not required when you submit your application, but it will be required after your application is successful. You must fill out the Payment form and attach an 8000<span class='ja'>円</span> revenue stamp to it. Revenue stamps can be purchased from the post office. Obviously, if you’ve been in Japan long enough, you already know how to do this from renewing your VISA.</p><p>Here’s the payment form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf</a></p><div class='title'><b>Application for Permanent Residence & Photo</b></div><p>1.      <span class='ja'>永住許可申請書</span><br/>2.      <span class='ja'>写真</span><br/>The first document is the application itself. Again, from renewing a VISA, all the same information is here with the addition of a short version of why you want permanent residence, work history, and guarantor information. For my reason, I wrote "I wish to obtain permanent residence to continue teaching in Japan indefinitely and continue my study of kendo and Japanese culture to further enrich myself." It sounds like a lofty reason, but I have fully explained it in the next section.</p><p>Here’s the application form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf</a></p><p>Additionally, you’ll need a 40mm x 30mm photo attached to your application.</p><div class='title'><b>Statement of Reason</b></div><p>3.      <span class='ja'>理由書</span><br/>Perhaps the part of this application that will take the longest is writing about why you want permanent residence in Japan. My short version stated that I wish to teach in Japan indefinitely and continue to learn about Japan, but those ideas are weak unless there is proof. In total, I wrote 3 pages about my time over the last 10 years.</p><p>I started with detailing my current responsibilities and accomplishments working at my high school: supporting English teachers in class, leading English writing classes, being an assistant Homeroom teacher, leading classes to prepare students for studying abroad, training students for speech contests and winning them, and teaching foreign exchange students Japanese language and culture.</p><p>Next, I detailed my accomplishments and responsibilities working in public elementary and junior high schools as part of the JET Programme, such as supporting English classes and training students for speech contests, but also volunteering in town for English conversations classes supporting the hospital and library, developing summer English camp and other events for students, and developing a full English curriculum for elementary schools.</p><p>Also, I detailed my responsibilities as a Regional Prefectural Advisory supporting other ALTs in my region and the prefecture by developing our biannual skills conferences and leading lectures and discussions about lesson planning and ideas, as well as lead monthly meeting for the ALTs in my town.</p><p>Finally, I closed my statement of reason with my contributions to the kendo federation in my town. I wrote about how I joined students in their club activities and practiced kendo, what I learned from doing kendo both personally and professionally, and eventually reaching the rank of 3-dan.</p><p>3 pages might have been too much for a statement of reason, but I wanted to completely show everything noteworthy that I’ve done in Japan. It was very direct and unemotional, focusing on the facts. My approach to writing the statement was very similar to writing a resume for an application. Overall, I don’t think the statement has to be completely emotionless, but I don’t think it should be the main focus of the argument. Show, don’t tell, as I say to my students.</p><p>Even though I wrote all this information in English, I had to rewrite everything in Japanese, too. I had some help with that. I included both English and Japanese versions of my statement in my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b></div><p>4.      <span class='ja'>身分関係を証明する次のいずれかの資料（該当しません）</span><br/>I am not Japanese, so this was not required for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Residence</b></div><p>5.      <span class='ja'>住民票</span><br/>Whenever you move somewhere in Japan, you must register at the town hall so it has a complete and up-to-date record of all of its residents. The application for permanent residence requires a print of this record. It was easy to get from my town’s registrar by filling out a request document and paying 300<span class='ja'>円</span> for them to print the record.</p><p>It has information, such as when you moved to town, current address, previous addresses, nationality, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Employment</b></div><p>6.      <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span><br/>In addition to proving that you live somewhere, you also need to prove that you work somewhere. This was pretty easy for me to get since my school is private and not that big. For a larger organization or a government organization, it might take some time for your request to go open the chain and for the document to come back down.</p><p>I just went to the office and they created a document that proved my employment. Depending on whichever company you work for, it may be an official document or it may not. I think it just needs to include a statement saying you work there as well as information that can be contacted later. My school/company just made up an official looking document with all the correct information on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b></div><p>7.      <span class='ja'>直近（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）の申請人及び申請人を扶養する方の所得及び納税状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Things start to get more complicated, as a single piece of paper proving your employment isn’t enough. Of course, you need to show that you’ve been paying taxes on the income that you’ve earned. And also show that you’ve been doing it for at least five years.</p><p>These documents include the <I>Kazei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>課税証明書</span> and the <I>Nozei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span>. Both documents translate as either Tax Certificate or Taxation Certificate, so looking at the English information about this section may not be helpful. Overall, the <I>Kazei</I> Tax Certificate details how much taxes you had to pay and what taxes you had to pay on your income within a given year. The <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate details the amount of taxes you still owe for a given year. Essentially, <I>Kazei</I> is like an itemized bill, and <I>Zozei</I> is the receipt.</p><p>Each document you’ll need for 5 years. For my town, I had a single <I>Kazei</I> Certificate for each year. For the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate, each year could be written on the same document. For each document, for each year, it cost 300<span class='ja'>円</span>. So for all the documents, my bill would’ve been 3000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>However, <I>update</I>, when I initially turned in my application, I forgot to get 5 years for the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate. I was able to turn in my application, but I needed to mail in the correct form within two weeks. They gave me an envelope and a sheet that described the document I was missing. Another problem, though: my town only keeps the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate up to 4 years, instead of the 5 years they wanted. I called them, and they said 4 years was fine. So, my bill was actually 2700<span class='ja'>円</span> for these documents.</p><p>Additionally! There’s another version of the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate that is required. Besides the Tax Record office in city hall, I went to my town’s official Tax Office. Requesting the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate from them shows them I’ve paid all debts and taxes across all government departments and agencies, as well as never missed any payment for any bills or loan. This document cost 500<span class='ja'>円</span> to print.</p><p>In addition, to these tax documents, I had to include a photo of my bank book that proved I was getting paid the correct income.</p><p>So, for this section, I included the following documents:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>課税証明書（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）</span>- Kazei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - Nozei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書（未払いの税金がないことを証明するためのパート</span>3<span class='ja'>）</span>- Nozei Cert proving no upaid taxes<br/>·        <span class='ja'>預貯金通帳（写し）</span>- Photo proving income.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b></div><p>8.      <span class='ja'>申請人の公的年金及び公的医療保険の保険料の納付状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Now that I had shown that I am legally employed, getting legally paid, and responsibly paying taxes on my legal income, I need to show that I’m paying into either my company’s pension or the government’s pension for at least two years. Also that I have health insurance.</p><p>This section was somewhat difficult to follow. Initially, I just took a photo copy of my annual pension report that I had gotten in mail, but (<I>update!</I>) apparently that wasn’t enough. A few days after I turned in my application, I got a letter in the mail requesting another form. The form they wanted detailed all of my pension payments, and each pension that I’ve contributed to. It was called the <I>Hihokenja Chousho Shoukai Kaitou-hyou</I> <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span> or the “Insurance Record Inquiry Report,” I think? I’m not sure why it says insurance when its about pensions.</p><p>To get this form, I had to go to my town’s Pension office and request these forms. Prior to going to the office, I had some co-workers give them a call to make sure I was getting the right forms, and they were able to prepare everything for me before I arrived. It turned a possible 40-minute wait into 5 minutes. This document was also 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Looking at this document, I’ve contributed into a government pension when I worked for the city as a teacher, and I’ve contributed to a private pension I have with my current job. </p><p>The letter wanted me to include receipts from any contributions to the government’s individual pension service, but I never did that, so I didn’t have any.</p><p>For the health insurance card, I just took a photo of it and blacked out the account number.</p><p>So, this is what I included from this section:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>ねんきん定期便（写し）</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>健康保険被保険者証（写し）</span></p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Financial Assets</b></div><p>9.      <span class='ja'>申請人又は申請人を扶養する方の資産を証明する次のいずれかの資料</span><br/>For the next part, I had to show all of Japanese financial assets. At minimum, I had to take photo copies of my bank statements to show how much money I have in Japan. I don’t have a house, so I didn’t have anything to show there. I do have a car, but I didn’t include any proof of that. Maybe I should have?</p><div class='title'><b>Passport Photo and Residence Card Photo</b></div><p>10.      <span class='ja'>申請人のパスポート（写し）</span><br/>11.      <span class='ja'>申請人の在留カード（写し）</span><br/>I included photo copies of my passport and residence card with my application, but this is not really necessary. When you turn in your application, you’ll need to also show them both of these, and they can take a photo copy themselves, at this time. I included these to save time.</p><div class='title'><b>Guarantor Information and References</b></div><p>12.      <span class='ja'>身元保証に関する資料</span><br/>A current Japanese citizen needs to vouch for who I am, what I stand for, and state that I would make a contribution to Japan by becoming a Japanese permanent resident. This person should be someone you know pretty well, and have a good relationship with. My principal at school has always sponsored my VISA, as well as other documents that required official clearance, so he was an easy choice as a guarantor.</p><p>They need to fill in the guarantor form and prove who they are. For my guarantor, we included the following:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>身元保証書</span> - the guarantor application<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証</span> - a photo copy of their ID (driver’s license, in this case)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span> - proof of employment, wherever they work.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - proof of tax payments. (<I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>住民票</span> - proof of residence.</p><p>Here’s the guarantor form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf</a> (Japanese)<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Contributions to Japan</b></div><p>13.      <span class='ja'>我が国への貢献に係る資料（</span>※<span class='ja'>ある場合のみで結構です。）</span><br/>This is the last meaty section of the application. For this section, I included my letters of recommendation and other certificates and awards of accomplishments. </p><p>In the end, I had 3 recommendation letters: one letter from the principal, one letter from the head of our English department, and one letter from head of the Kendo federation in my town. Each letter of recommendation talked about the contributions that I made to my school and kendo in town, and talked about why they think I should be awarded permanent residence.</p><p>Additional documents that I included were proof of things mentioned in either my Statement of Reason or their Letters of Recommendation. I included a photo of my kendo license showing participation for 10 years, my 3-dan diploma, and certificates of participation for 3 years in the international budo conference.

It doesn’t really seem like all that much once I finished making everything and putting it together. However, a lot of the time spent on the application is figuring out exactly what is required and where to go. The tax and pensions details are pretty tricky. I think my situation is pretty easy because I’ve only had the one job in the last 5 years, and the job is run by a professional organization. I also don’t have a house. Although, getting those documents probably aren’t too tough.</p><p>On February 13th, I drove up north to Toyama and turned in my application at Toyama Branch Office of the Nagoya Regional Immigration Bureau. A long time ago, I figured out that very few people actually go to this branch office, so the wait time is never more than 5 minutes. In Gifu, wait times can be as long as 45 minutes. And in Nagoya, a friend of mine waited for an hour and a half once.</p><p>Again, the clerk instantly noticed one probably with my application (the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate not being 5 years), so I had to submit that afterward. I also got a letter in the mail on February 17th about the pension document. But, they accepted my application, and I’ve mailed those requested document as soon as I could. All documents were submitted as of February 21st, and I have not received any more letters about any more problems.  I think it’s all good!</p><p>Typically these application can take up to six months to be completely reviewed and responded to, but the clerk mentioned that it may only take three months to be complete. Over the last three years, thanks to Covid, the number of people moving to Japan has significantly decreased because the government shut down travel.  Previously, my VISA application would take 4 weeks to get approved, but it only took a week last year.</p><p>Hopefully, by May, I’ll get the postcard in the mail to come back down and get my card. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Arrival - Dual Language Subtitles" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/arrival-dual-language-subtitles">Arrival - Dual Language Subtitles</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Its ideas of language learning and development significant struck me because deal with the differences of language and culture on a daily basis in my life and my work living in a foreign country.</p><p>I wrote about these ideas before, and how they inspired me to talk about them to my junior high school classes at the time. You can read them here: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival thoughts from February 2017</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" /></p><p>This year, once again, I'm using this film in my classes to talk about language and learning. My high school class will watch the whole film, and try to understand how the idea of environment and thinking determines the language that society speaks.</p><p>The purpose of the assignment is to understand the ideas the film discusses and not focus so much on the direct translation of what is said. Therefore, I needed Japanese subtitles for the film. English subtitles are pretty easy to find online, but almost every other language is a mixed-bag of low quality machine generated garbage. Japanese subtitles even moreso because of how distant it is from English.</p><p>So, I created a subtitle file that has both English and Japanese, timed perfectly with each other, and each line of dialogue having complete sentences and meaning side-by-side.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view">drive/ Arrival.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG].EnJpDual.ass</a></p><p>I didn't completely translate it myself. I found some Japanese subtitles already created. But, it had several errors and several timings were wrong. All of those problems have been fixed and timed perfectly with the English script.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" /></p><p>The subtitles are in ASS format because SRT does not support dual languages. ASS overwrites size and color, so you'll need to modify the file if you want to change any of that. Although, the size is specifically set for some long sentences to fit perfectly, so I would recommend not enlarging them.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket Extras" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-extras">Analogue Pocket Extras</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I started playing Pokemon Go in the beginning in 2016, but I didn’t really seriously start playing it until 2018, and I started a second account and played them both at the same time. My primary account was ahead of my secondary, but it didn’t take long for it to catch up and have pokemon teams just as powerful. After a few months, both accounts were essentially mirrors of each other.</p><p>By the end of 2020, my primary account was able to hit level 40, but my secondary account still lagged behind.  In order to reach level 40, you need a total of 20 million XP in the game. I think my primary was at 25 million at that point? And my secondary may have been at 18 million.</p><p>With the increased level caps set, you’ll now need a total of 176 million XP to reach level 50. In fact, the gap between level 49 and level 50 alone with 30 million XP. With these requirements and my current progress, I resigned myself that it would take years upon years to actually get there.</p><p>In the end, it only took 2 years and a month.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">DyreSchlock - Jan 29th<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - Jan 31st<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Both of my accounts hit level 50 last week after a long 7 months of being stuck on level 49.  In addition to needed XP to gain a level, you also have unique level requirements, like hatching some amount of eggs, or defeating some amount of rocket members. Level 49 requires you land 1000 excellent throws on Pokemon, which is very time consuming and annoying if you don’t manually play so often. I was able to grind them out with the most recent Electric event, though.</p><p>So, if it took me more than two years prior to 2021 to gain 20 million XP, how was I able to get more than 150 million in just two years? Overall, 3 main factors contributed to my XP, but a few other things also changed how I played.</p><div class='title'><b>XP Gains</b></div><p>First, as the level cap was raised, so was the XP you gain for doing various things in the game. Catching Pokemon gave you a little more. Spinning stops gave you a little bit. Defeating Raid bosses gave you a little more. And, most notably, excellent throws now gave you 1000xp.  Before, I think it was 200xp.</p><p>Second, additionally, evolving Pokemon now gave you 1000xp, too. Throughout the weeks, as I caught a lot of Pokemon, if I could evolve them, I would put them into their own group. There are many Pokemon in the game, and many of these Pokemon are not useful in battles. Because of this, I’d just throw them away to make room to catch more. But, if I have a lot of candy for those Pokemon, may as well make them useful by evolving them for the XP. When you use a Lucky Egg, you’ll get double XP for the next 30 minutes. AND! I logged into a single account using both of my phones. I could evolve double the amount of Pokemon and get double the amount of XP. <b>In 30 minutes, I could get about 750 thousand XP</b>. I caught enough Pokemon that I could do this every 2 or 3 weeks.</p><p>Thirdly, the absolute best way to get XP in the game is through friendships. After 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days, you’ll increase your friendship level for 10 thousand, 50 thousand, and 100 thousand XP. Use a Lucky Egg to double it. Making friends in Pokemon go wasn’t easy to begin with, but it became very easy when they introduced Remote Raids. Other people built match making apps where you friend each other to do raids. After hosting MANY MANY raids, I continue to send gifts to people and increase friendships. Every 2 or 3 weeks when I did evolves, I would get the XP from friendships, too. After one of these sessions, I would routinely make around 1.5 million. One night, I made more than 5 million.</p><div class='title'><b>Play Style</b></div><p>Those were specific things I did to significantly increase my level, but overall, my play style is much different than it was prior to 2021 and the game has changed a lot, too.</p><p>The main way my play style changed was using these two things:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" /></p><p>The Pokeball Plus was released in 2018 with the release of Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee, and meant to be used as a controller, but you could also connect it to Pokemon Go. When connected it will automatically spin stops for you. Also, when you're near a Pokemon you can click the button to try to catch it. Well, if you buy those rubber protectors above and shove a coin or two over the button, the button will automatically be pressed down and it will automatically catch a Pokemon.</p><p>With these two Pokeballs, I can turn on Pokemon Go, turn on the Pokeballs, and it will automatically capture Pokemon as I drive around town. This is an amazing efficient way of getting a lot of Pokemon very quickly and catching a lot of Pokemon that I wouldn't have caught otherwise. It's not a 100% catch rate, but it's still doing a lot more work than I would have to do manually, and it frees me up to focus on driving and moving around.</p><p>As time goes on, the radius that allows you to spin stops was increased and the overall number of pokemon that spawn has increased, too. I'm catching far more Pokemon than I ever had before.</p><div class='title'><b>Level History</b></div><p>It didn't take too long for both of my accounts to go through level 41, 42, 43, etc. Once I hit the mid-40s, I would take about a month or two or three to make it to the next level before I finally hit level 49. Each time you gain a level past 40, you have the option of saving your stat sheet, so I saved all of these images when I could.  Here are my past few levels as a comparison.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">DyreSchlock - June 12th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - June 16th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column">DyreSchlock - March 29th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - May 7th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column">DyreSchlock - Dec 25th 2021<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - Feb 26th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>End Game</b></div><p>Maybe they'll increase the level cap again in the future, but I doubt it.

Part of the reason it took me 7 months to gain a level was because I was barely playing the game. It's always fun to explore around town playing Pokemon Go, but with one less goal overall, it is one less reason to play, and that's a good thing. I can focus on other stuff instead.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Car Mileage" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/car-mileage">Car Mileage</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is to ensure that the cars are still safe to drive and that they haven't been illegally modified. It's usually costs at least $1000, which is annoying, but it's even more annoying when you have a bunch of repair costs tacked on top of it.</p><p>When I arrived in Japan, I had to buy a car because public transportation up in the mountains was not feasible. The car mechanic in town had a pretty good deal on a 2004 <b>Subaru R2</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Subaru R2 is a Kei car, denoted by its yellow plate. Kei cars are smaller and have smaller engines. This also means they get some pretty great gas mileage.  I bought the car in 2013, but as <I>Shaken</I> loomed in 2021, the bottom plating had begun to erode away and it was no longer road-worthy. My mechanic information me that the repairs would be too much, and I should buy a new car. I had a bunch of money saved up from stimulus checks and not traveling due to lockdown, so it wasn't too bad.</p><p>My mechanic and I went through a bunch of cars on the open market, and I finally settled on a 2017 <b>Daihatsu Mira ES</b>. I wanted to continue owning a Subaru, but they discontinued their line of Kei cars, and Daihatsu has purchased their designs. The Mira is a slight evolution of the R2 mixed with Daihatsu designs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I went with Red to try and set myself apart from the conformity of all the White, Off-White, and Grey cars of Japan. Nobody likes colors in their cars over here. It's still not completely unique, though, as the Mira ES is one of the most popular Kei cars on the road.

Judgment is a new game from Ryu Ga Gotoku studios (makers of the Yakuza game series). It was a bit long, but follows the adventures of Yagami, a former Lawyer, now private detective. You go around real-Tokyo-location Kabukicho trying to uncover a conspiracy of murders and their connections to the Yakuza and Police. It was a pretty great experience with a few unexpected twists. The story is completely standalone and concludes in the end.</p><p>The sequel is a new adventure and new case that Yagami follows. You also go to a new location in Yokohama. The story is about a murder involving a high school. While the story isn't as important as the first game, visiting the school and talking with students and teachers is pretty fun. Ultimately, I did not finish it.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>I played through the Judgment games at the beginning of the year, but once Pokemon Legends was released in February, it was the only thing I played for months, and I never really returned to Playstation after that.</p><p>The reason <b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b> is one of the best Pokemon games of all time is the freedom of movement, the fast paced method of catching and collecting Pokemon, and the sense of exploration through the uncharted world. One of my favorite things about Pokemon is completing the Pokedex, and the main story goal of Legends is to do just that. It's so fun.</p><p>After playing the game for month, I went back to <b>Let's Go Eevee</b> to clean up more shiny Pokemon I had yet to capture. I bought a turbo controller to automate trading for shiny Alolan pokemon.</p><p>And, in November, <b>Pokemon Scarlet / Violet</b> were released.  Again, I played the game from nearly sun up to sun down. It was a much more expansive experience than Sword and Shield, but unfortunately took none of the lessons from Pokemon Legends. In fact, it's a far worse experience in almost every way. The performance is terrible where it can take up to 4 seconds for some pokemon to spawn in. There's only a visual indication on whether or not a pokemon is shiny, so you really have to pay attention when shiny hunting. Movement is a bit slower compared with Legends, too.</p><p>But, Scarlet and Violet are still quite excellent. I would put them in the upper tier of Pokemon games.</p><p>Anyways, here are my stats for the year:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" /></a></p><p>The individual stats above I thought were the most informative and interesting.

The most visible front-facing part of these cores is the Platform information and image. This includes how cores are sorted in the openFPGA menu, the titles of the core in the menu, and the image that appears when selected. </p><p>Some core information is slightly inconsistent with others, so I've been rewriting Platform information on my own and making new images as well. I made in initial release back in November covering some cores to make them consistent with others. But now I've finished making a complete image set that covers all currently released cores.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221227_pocket/IMG_0246_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Arcade Images</b></div><p>For each of the Arcade core, I've tried to make an image like the original marquee for the Arcade cabinet. Usually these images are available, and it only takes 5 minutes to make the image. But, for some Arcade games, those images can be hard to find in good quality. Often too, if I do get a good image, the original artwork looks lame.</p><p>Recently, I've been recreating many of these images using key art from officially marketing at the time. I put the image on the canvas and try to make it fit. Often I need to blend things around, move the title and other things in the background for a good composition. Now, I tend to spend around an hour of two making an image.</p><p>Additionally, there are some Arcade cores that can run multiple noteworthy games since manufacturers often reused their boards for other games.

Thus, I created a "Home" image set to complement my Arcade images. Home would include cores for Consoles, Handhelds, and Computers. Technically, handhelds aren't specifically made for the home, but I think this monicker is pretty descriptive.</p><p>I really liked <a href="https://github.com/terminator2k2/Analogue-Pocket-Core-Art" title="https://github.com/terminator2k2/Analogue-Pocket-Core-Art">Terminator2k2</a>'s Image set which just had the logos of the systems, but I needed to do something else to distinguish my set. I got the idea when I started looking at old ads for consoles that showed off their game libraries. Also on Twitter, many people like to post a smattering or a pile of game boxes when they have a large haul from a shopping spree. I thought that I should try and do that. Games are the most important thing for any console or handheld after all. They should be displayed front and center.</p><p>I already had a bunch of box art downloaded thanks to my <a href="/old/v7/pocket-utils" title="/pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a> project, so I made a collage of them in photoshop, added some perspective, shrunk down to the correct size, and color-corrected some things to make it look alright in grayscale.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Overall, I think they turned out pretty good.

The MiSTer is another FPGA device that has been around much longer than the Analogue Pocket, and there are hundreds of cores that have been created. All cores available for the Analogue Pocket today are ports of these cores. Because of this, it's easy to see a roadmap for future cores to be released on the Pocket. In particular, core developers <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jotego/posts" title="https://www.patreon.com/jotego/posts">Jotego</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opengateware" title="https://github.com/opengateware">Open Gateware</a> (aka Boogerman) have a wealth of cores they plan to bring to the Pocket.</p><p>I've worked ahead quite a bit so when new cores are released, I don't have to spend that afternoon making the image.

| October 13, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month, the Analogue Pocket has continued to be an absolute monster. The Sega Genesis is now available. The Nintendo Entertainment System is now available. Sega GameGear is available, too. And there have been many cores of 1980s Arcade games released, too.</p><p>It's starting to get unwieldily, so I've created a collection of programs to help me organize and process games so they can be played on the Pocket.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils</a></p><p>I've been working on this pretty solidly for the past three weeks, and I think it's finally feature finished. The GitHub repository has straight forward information of how each process is set up and what exactly each process does. But, overall…</p><p>Pocket Utils is a collection of scripts and programs that do several things, including the following: (1) Process MRA files and Create Arcade Roms, (2) Create Library Images for sorted Games, and (3) Update Platform information for cores.</p><div class='title'><b>Process MRA Files</b></div><p>The Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, or MAME, on computer standardized how to emulate arcade games. When ripping games from their original boards, each component had their own file, and everything was put together in a zip file. </p><p>FPGA emulation of arcade games doesn't like this. The chip wants direct read access to the data it wants and unzipping a file in memory is extra useless overhead. Thus, the idea of a MRA file was introduced. A MRA file contains specific instructions on how each piece of the arcade board can be assembled into a single ROM file. This file is not compressed and allow free access to all the data the FPGA wants. </p><p>A separate program is required to process these MRA files, though. I use this <a href="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c" title="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c">MRA Tool</a> found in NullObject's GitHub. When an arcade core is released for the Analogue Pocket, it'll come with MRA files to create ROMs from ZIP files of arcade components. You must get the arcade ROM zips, process the MRA file in the program giving it the zip files, and then place the generated ROM into the core's folder on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>There are lots of steps to getting this to work, and many arcade cores released for the Analogue Pocket play multiple games. Some releases come with 10 or more games. In fact, arcade systems like Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 have as many as 300 variants of their games. Doing all of this manually is not feasible.</p><p>This program solves this problem.</p><p>Put all of your MRA files in the to-be-processed directory. Run the program. It'll attempt to download any and all ZIP files required to make the arcade rom, and store them locally. If the Arcade ROM is successfully generated, it'll copy it to the correct directory on the Pocket, and also copy the MRA file to the Pocket, too.</p><p>If it can't find the ZIP files online, you can manually search for them and put them in your local store. If a ROM was already generated, it'll copy over the MRA file anyway. If the MRA file is already there, it'll copy it to a duplicate directory.</p><p>With Standard games, everything works really well and there are almost never any problems. Problems usually only come up when trying to generate bootlegs or hacks of roms. Those often require extra steps.</p><div class='title'><b>Create Library Images</b></div><p>One of the most appealing features of the Analogue Pocket is the Library feature. </p><p>Something I've never liked about using emulators is having to choose the games I want to play from a list. It's so sterile and clinical. The Super Nintendo Mini was so amazing because of its visual presentation. You had a line games presented with their box art. And you could visually choose the game you wanted to play by selecting that box art.</p><p>The Library feature of the Analogue Pocket was just that. It gave you a visual list of all your games to select from. Further still, you could organize all of your games in Playlists. This was promised in Analogue's Tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888">Analogue OS</a>.</p><p>By default, the Analogue Pocket has an internal list of game data but it doesn't have an images. Early on, you could download an image pack that gave you all the title screens for every game. But I don't want title screens. I want box arts.</p><p>It took a little while to figure out, but the Analogue Pocket uses a CRC hash of the file to reference which image is uses in the Library. If you have a correctly sized PNG file, you can run it through <a href="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter" title="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter">DerTolleEmil</a>'s Image Converter and it'll give you a BIN file. Put this bin file in the correct folder named with the CRC hash, and it'll use this image in the Library.</p><p>So, my program goes a bit further with it.</p><p>In each of the folders for Consoles and Handhelds on the Analogue Pocket, I have the ROMs that I like sorted into genre folders. My initial "CreatePocketEntries" program will collect all of these games in my database. "CreateLibraryImages" will look at every game in my database and attempt to download the box art image from <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" title="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails">LibRetro</a> on Github. With this image, my program will resize it to the correct dimensions for the Pocket, convert the PNG image to BIN, name it correctly, and copy the file to the System folder on the Pocket.</p><p>Now, when using the Library, the image matches the box art. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Update Platform Information</b></div><p>Another thing that I collect in my database is Core information.</p><p>When a user chooses a core from the openFPGA menu on the Pocket, it lists certain information about itself, such as when the console or handheld was original released, who was the manufacture, and also the name and category of the core, too. All core developers are very particular about the accurate representation of the consoles, games, and their code, so this information is usually correct, but sometime it is not to avoid copyright and trademark violations.</p><p>In the database, it's easy for me to edit this information and also collect all the information into categories. My program will rewrite all of the information in the Platforms directory with what I have in my database. </p><p>Additionally, it'll create Platform Images using agg23's <a href="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process" title="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process">Platform Image Creator</a>. Any new images that I've made and placed in the processing directory will be converted and copied over.</p><div class='title'><b>Run the Updater</b></div><p>There is also a simple shell script that runs <a href="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility" title="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility">Matt Pannella</a>'s command line program with all of the settings that I like.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I use this stuff pretty often when new cores and new features are released, so there continue to be more updates. When Playlists eventually come to the Pocket, I'll have a new program to make those. I'm also working on another program that will make a list of games I have in my "unsorted" directories for each core.</p><p>The Pocket continues to be one of the absolute best gaming devices made, and being able to make all this stuff to organize games has gotten back into programming on the side. It's been pretty great. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket">Analogue Pocket</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Initially announced as a modern device that plays games from the family of GameBoys, it has grown to become exactly what I wanted and has yet to reach its full potential.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Analogue</b></div><p>Analogue is a company that specializes in creating retro gaming consoles. They are most widely known for making a $200 Nintendo and a $200 Super Nintendo. You can plug your original cartridges from these systems into these new ones, and everything still works. There have been several other machines that have done this in recent years, but Analogue’s edge is its use of the FPGA.</p><p>Internally, Analogue has reversed engineered and replicated the original chipsets of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo and have them running on a chip called an FPGA. This means that the games aren’t running in emulation on a PC or on Linux or something. It’s running the original processors EXACTLY the same way the original hardware did.</p><p>By doing this, Analogue has replicated the exact original look and feel of the original console to near perfection.</p><div class='title'><b>Analogue Pocket Announcement</b></div><p>On <b>October 16th, 2019</b>, Analogue announced its newest hardware recreation, the Analogue Pocket. The Analogue Pocket would be their first handheld device, and it would play GameBoy, GameBoy Color, and GameBoy Advanced games. Sold separately, you could also buy a Dock that would charge the device and hook up to a TV.</p><p>However, the biggest hint at its potential was the inclusion of a second FPGA chipset. A primary FPGA was included that would run a Game cartridge, but the second FPGA would be open to developers to do whatever they wanted with. This meant that it may be possible for people to play their own Game roms on the device. And this also meant that people could write code for other consoles to be played, like a Game Gear, or a Sega Genesis, or a Super Nintendo.</p><p>Recently I had been able to rediscover many amazing retro games thanks to the Super Nintendo Mini. But, the Mini was cumbersome and could only play certain games. If the Pocket could play Super Nintendo and other stuff, too, it would be like the Nintendo Switch for retro games. I could play Super Nintendo portably, or plug it into the TV and play them there. It would be perfect.</p><div class='title'><b>Analogue Pocket Release</b></div><p>Almost a year later on August 1st, a date and time was announced when you could buy one. For me, it would be Midnight on <b>August 4th 2020</b>. Hype for the device began to buzz around the Internet with even Elijah Wood posting about it. Of course, this was the height of global lockdown from the Coronavirus, so any news on the Internet spread very quickly. I planned on staying up to secure my order.</p><p>Analogue’s Store page went live at Midnight, and I knew exactly what I wanted: Black Pocket, Dock, Case, Screen Protector, and Cable. Putting things into my cart was easy, but actually purchasing was a nightmare. The pages took a while to load, or didn’t load at all. I typed in all of my information and hit save, but international shipping took a while to appear. I kept hitting that Purchase button to conclude the sale, and eventually it went through. After waking up the next day, a purchase confirmation email was in my inbox. It was a success! My order was in the #54xxx range.</p><p>The Pocket was expected to release in early or mid-2021. That was pushed to October, and then it was pushed again. Finally, orders began shipping in December, and on <b>December 24th, 2021</b>, my Pocket arrived in the mail. Over 2 years after its announcement, and over 1 year after its purchase.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Analogue Pocket</b></div><p>Out of the box, the Analogue Pocket does exactly what it says it would do. You plug in a GameBoy game, it plays perfectly fine. You plug in a GameBoy Advance game, it plays perfectly fine. But that was all that it did. On release, the second FPGA chip was not yet available for other developers to use.</p><p>Fast forward to <b>July 30th 2022</b> and <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1553032922143330306" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1553032922143330306">the first firmware update</a> was released. The second FPGA was now available and the first core was released which recreated Spacewar, the first interactive game ever created on a computer.</p><div class='title'><b>Neo Geo</b></div><p>A day later, something amazing showed up online. There was a <a href="https://github.com/Mazamars312/Analogue_Pocket_Neogeo" title="https://github.com/Mazamars312/Analogue_Pocket_Neogeo">core for the Neo Geo</a>. The Neo Geo was a console released in the 90s which was identical to the company's Arcade hardware. It was the first time you could play perfect versions of Arcade games in your home. It was very expensive, so very few people actually bought it.</p><p>The Neo Geo is home to some of my favorite games of all time, now they were available on the Pocket. And they looked absolutely stunning.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Not all games played at first, but the ones that worked were perfect.

Find the new details on the update page here: <a href="/old/v7/pokemon-go-raid-counters" title="/pokemon-go-raid-counters">/pokemon-go-raid-counters</a></I></p><p>Linked below is my collated list of all the best raid counters in Pokemon Go. These numbers of based on the calculations made by Gamepress’s <a href="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet" title="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet">Comprehensive DPS Spreadsheet</a> but put together on a single page, rather than multiple ones.</p><p><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general">General Raid Counter List</a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0233.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0233.webp" /></a></p><p>It’s not the prettiest page, but it shows everything I need in order to build my raid team. Each cell shows the following:<br/>- the name of the Pokemon<br/>- the level of the Pokemon used for the calculations<br/>- the fast move<br/>- the charge move<br/>- the DPS<br/>- the TDO<br/>- the final figure is DPS*4 x TDO / 100000. This is the number I used to sort each list.</p><p>Doing more damage quickly is more important than staying alive, so I prioritize DPS. But, it’s not solely sorted by DPS because if you die immediately with no defense, it’s totally worthless.  Therefore, I’m using DPS*4 rather than DPS*3.</p><p>I’m including level 40 for all Pokemon, but I’m also including level 50 for all non-legendary pokemon and level 45 for all legendaries. It’s not too difficult to boost Pokemon up to level 40, but even though you can boost them all the way up to 50, getting XL candies for legendaries is not so easy. Includes two levels for each Pokemon can show you how much more powerful one is compared to the rest.</p><div class='title'><b>Purpose</b></div><p>For some quick background, in Pokemon Go, there are these Pokemon battles called raids that multiple people can join to defeat the boss. Once the boss is defeated, each player has a chance to catch that Pokemon for themselves. These Pokemon are strong enough that you cannot defeat them by yourself. Each boss is different, but you usually must have 3 or 4 players minimum to win, assuming they have the best Pokemon for the battle.</p><p>But what are the best Pokemon for the battle? A while ago, the Pokemon community on <b>Gamepress</b> wrote a calculator that would tell you just how powerful a Pokemon was versus a raid boss. If you typed in the Pokemon you wanted to fight, it would give you a numbered list of all the best pokemon you’d need to defeat it.</p><p>When I was first doing raids, I found this calculator very useful to determine which Pokemon to catch and boost. However, for this calculator, you need to type in each individual Pokemon one by one to see each of the best counters.  I wanted a page that I could look at and see ALL of the best pokemon versus ALL of the raid pokemon in Pokemon Go. So, I made one.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Raid Counter List</b></div><p>The calculator will save a CSV will all the data for the raid counters.  So, back in 2019, I made this page to display all the information from these CSV files. Over time, this became unmanageable because the number of raid bosses continued to grow and the number of best Pokemon and best moves began to grow too. It would take me about an hour to download each individual sheet.</p><p>The Gamepress Calculator does all of its calculations in JavaScript. So over summer, I went through that code and ported it to Java. Now, rather than compiling data from generated CSV files, I can generate that data myself. And, rather than downloading 30+ CSV files, I only need to download the raw data files and rerun the page.</p><p><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general">General Raid Counter List</a></p><p>The General list says which are the best raid pokemon overall, but I also wrote a page that shows me which of my Pokemon are the best. I have to manually add every one of these, so my list is often out of date, but it gives me a general idea how much damage my team can do or how many people I’ll need to recruit to beat the boss.</p><p><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom">Personal Raid Counter List</a></p><p>I’m not sure if any of this is readable to anyone else, but it helps me out. :)<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/12">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/10">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
