A couple of miles up the road we came across a touristy place called the Sea Lion Caves.  We stopped the car to take a look.  After playing a fee of $12 (or something like that), you were guided out back, and down the coast a little bit to an elevator.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9938.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9938.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9938.webp"  /></p><p>The elevator shaft cuts straight through the rock and goes directly into the caves below.  In the caves are some educational facts about Sea Lions, including how to tell the different between a Seel, and a Sea Lion.  (Sea Lion's have visible ear flaps, while Seels do not).</p><p>The caves have a huge opening to the ocean, and just inside were a couple hundred Sea Lions hanging out, and making a lot of noise.  There was a fence separating us from them, so we weren't able to pet or hug them. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9843_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>The other end of the cave lead out to the original man-made entrance of the cave before the elevator was installed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9864_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_9896_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>It was pretty neat, I guess.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Lion_Caves" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Lion_Caves" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Lion_Caves">Wikipedia</a> has more information about the history of the caves.

The areas we were looking for were Devil's Churn, Cooks Chasm, Thor's Well, and a couple other natural formation of the ocean smashing into the rocky coast.  We stopped at the Visitor's Center to get a map, and a general idea of where these places might be.</p><p>We tried to find Thor's Well first, but it was a little difficult since it wasn't marked on any maps.  We stopped the car where we thought it was supposed to be and started walking along the coast.</p><p class='img'><a

I bought a Rice Cooker, a gigantic pan, and the ingredients.  And it really was just that easy.  Vegetables first, add eggs, add rice, add soy sauce.</p><p>It's pretty much my "go-to" meal in the kitchen, and over the past 10 years I've come up with some good combinations of ingredients and sauces that compliment each other pretty well.  I started experimenting with some new ingredients over the past few months, and the results have turned out pretty well.</p><p><b>Squash</b> (particularly Acorn Squash) seasoned with a little honey and pepper makes for a bold flavor all around.  Fried <b>tomatoes</b> add a rich earthy, flavored tone to the mix.  And <b>cucumbers</b> are damn refreshing in almost everything you mix them with.  So, I decided to mix all 3 together and see what would happen.</p><div class='title'><b>Ingredients</b></div><p>Overall Ingredients include rice, eggs, tomato, cucumber, acorn squash, onion, and red pepper.  Along with a little butter, some balsamic vinegar, some honey, pepper, oil (in this case canola oil), and soy sauce.  For soy sauce, I'm using a combination of the citrus stuff, Ponzu, and some organic brand.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9648.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9651.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9652.webp"  /></p><p>Before doing any of the cooking, we need to prepare the rice, and the squash.</p><p>Overall, the amount of ingredients I'm going to use should feed about <b>4 people</b>, or 2 super hungry people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rice Preparation</b></div><p>The rice is pretty damn easy.  I used 2 cups of rice this time since I was cooking for more than just me.  Be sure to wash the rice thoroughly to remove any dust and dirt that has collecting in the bag.  Clean rice gives a totally pure taste.  If you don't wash your rice, it ends up tasting somewhat muddy, and tainted.</p><p>Anyway, 2 cups of rice, add the proper amount of water, and shove that into your rice cooker.  It usually takes about 40 minutes.  Rice cookers are pretty nice.  Most modern rice cookers will automatically switch to a warming mode, so you can keep your rice sitting in there for almost a day later.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120313_friedrice/IMG_9650.webp"  /></p><p>I've had my rice cooker since studying abroad in Japan, and I have found it VASTY superior to any western/American made one I've had in the past.  Most American models are designed to make 5+ cups of rice at once, but totally fail if you want to make a single cup of rice.  You can find a lot of the Japanese models on Amazon, totally in English, if you're interested in getting a really good one.</p><p>Here's the exact model I have, but in English : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24" title="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24" title="http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-ECJ-S35K-Micro-Computerized-Bread-Baking-Function/dp/B000W9WYBW/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331696808&amp;sr=8-24">Sanyo ECJ-S35K</a></p><p>Or, you can just skip the rice cookers, and make rice the old fashion way with a pot on the stove.

| February 19, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last night, Gabriel & Dresden visited Chicago and put on an amazing performance that spanned genres, and eras.  At one point in time, Gabriel & Dresden were my absolute favorite trance group.  Their mixes were beautiful, melodic, layered, and sounded like nothing else, but I don't think they liked being restricted to a single genre.</p><p>Last year, I wrote a post about all of this: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">June 23rd, 2011</a>.  As time went on, they adapted their style towards the change in EDM.  They always featured some of the best tracks, and presented them with their own sound.  Their sound was as reactionary, as it was trendsetting amongst some Trance DJs.  I had always viewed them as curators of EDM, with an added focus on Trance.</p><p>After a 3 year break, they reunited last year with a slightly different sound than what people were used to.  It had a harder edge.  There was mainstream Trance tracks, some popular "House" tracks, and Dubstep tracks filling in some gaps, which was mashed up for consistent flow.  Plenty of fans complained about the change in style, but these people fail to realize that this is exactly what they've always done.  They've never been straight up trance.  (except for, maybe, at the beginning)</p><div class='title'><b>Last Year</b></div><p>Last year, they stopped by Chicago on <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid" title="/gabriel-dresden-the-mid" title="/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">July 9th</a>, and performed a set nearly identical to others that had been broadcasted, recorded, and hosted online.  It was exactly what I wanted, but it had no surprises.  At that time, I think they were trying to get the word out there.  They built up a fantastic cache of mash ups, and remixes, and were ready to use them effectively in a city near you.</p><p>Fair enough.  They ended up using all those track to form an mix album, which was released on Armada towards the end of summer last year.</p><p>Today...  It's been a year since they've gotten back together, and they haven't been nearly as self-promoting as they were after the reunion.  I definitely wanted to see them again, and see what has changed, what they've learned, and how they've adapted to the rapidly changing landscape of EDM.</p><div class='title'><b>Last Night!</b></div><p>And they have adapted.  Last night, Dave Dresden and Josh Gabriel spun for a little over 3 hours.  And started off with some somewhat heavy tracks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/flyer.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9494.webp"  /></p><p>I caught the first 40 minutes on video, which you can find here:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRZXCM093qU</a></p><p>They started off with a mashup of Beautiful Things, and went into some heavy tracks.  45 minutes into the set, they started shifting focus a little bit, and started playing a lot of their tracks from last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9513.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120218_gabrieldresden/IMG_9515.webp"  /></p><p>I definitely heard the following tracks:</p><p>- Andain - Promises (Gabriel & Dresden Remix)<br/>- Motorcycle - As The Rush Comes (DJ Kue Remix)<br/>- Clashback vs. Michael Woods vs. R.E.M. - Losing My Outset (Gabriel & Dresden Mashup)<br/>- Josh Gabriel pres.

I've now seen them twice after their reunion, and the other times were in 2004 when I was WAY into them.  Oddly enough, the first time I saw them live was February 28th, 2004, almost 8 years ago exactly.  And I wrote about that experience as well.  Be prepared, as it is very horribly written --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/chi-town" title="/chi-town" title="/chi-town">Click!</a>.  I took a lot of <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago">pictures</a>, too.</p><p>I met some people from the Trance Addict forum in real life, and we had a meet and greet with Gabriel & Dresden at a bar down the road.  It was awkward, hilarious, and insightful.  As that post states, Josh Gabriel explained that he thinks of sounds in the form of textures, and used the feel of a song for his composing and mixing.</p><p>I think that rings true today, as their recent sets continue to flow just as well as the ones back in the day.  In fact, I think their sets from the last year are more cohesive than the ones they played leading into their break up.  Sure, plenty of the tracks are popular, but it's never a jolting experience when it's mixed in.  They've edited and mashed the songs to fit their style, so it's consistent with both the original track and their sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Final Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I'm glad to see these guys continue to dominant.  I was a little scared when they hadn't been promoting as much these days, but they are far from dormant.  I'm sure we just got a taste of their upcoming performance(s) at WMC next month, and I can't wait to see what they have down the road.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect 3 Demo" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-3-demo">Mass Effect 3 Demo</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 16, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Despite trying to hold off on watching media about this game, I decided to download the demo and play through it.<br/>___</p><p>Seems like the first area is the introduction to the entire game. I'm sure it's cut up a little bit to be paced well as a demo, but this is probably what we're going to see in the first an hour or two of the game. And then it's off to space to recruit people, or whatever. I think both Mass Effect 1 and 2 were paced pretty well. Mass Effect 1 gave a great introduction to the universe while sticking pretty close to a story. And Mass Effect 2 put the story on hold at multiple points in the game, and we were able to learn more about the rich universe.</p><p>I loved the universe building stuff, but if they're going add in a lot of that against the urgency of stopping the reaper threat, my belief won't be suspended for long. It's like spending 10+ hours (months in game) fishing in Legend of Zelda while the princess rots in a castle. "Eh, Earth can wait while I run off to the Hanar homeworld and learn about their culture." (Hopefully, we can go to the Hanar homeworld in ME3 ^_^)<br/>___</p><p>Also, one thing I found a bit annoying, and will certainly irk a lot of anal retentive Mass Effect fans is that they use the term "Ammo" is the game (demo) quite a bit. As if those things you pick up hold some amount of bullets to be fired by your gun. There is no ammunition used in the weapons of Mass Effect. All weapons fire plasma, or whatever, and those things you pick up are thermal clips. The shot counter on the side of the screen is how many shots you can fire before you burn out your gun, and finding additional thermal clips will allow you to fire more shots.</p><p>This point was brought up in the dissection of Mass Effect Deception found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBpMF3ONlI308D9IGG8KICBHfWKU0sXh0ntukv-_cmo/preview?pli=1&sle=true" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBpMF3ONlI308D9IGG8KICBHfWKU0sXh0ntukv-_cmo/preview?pli=1&sle=true" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBpMF3ONlI308D9IGG8KICBHfWKU0sXh0ntukv-_cmo/preview?pli=1&sle=true">Google Docs</a>.  Number 15 under oddities.  Did William Dietz have written credits for Mass Effect 3 as well?<br/>___</p><p>Another thing that annoyed me from the first part of the demo was at the end when those civilians and soldiers hop on board those shuttles only to be wiped out by the reaper landing right behind them. Why the hell didn't that thing shoot at the Normandy?! The Normandy was a way bigger target and hovering still in the air. And, I'm sure Harbinger told all the reapers about Shepard. Don't you think they'd be on the look out for that exact same ship? The same one that destroyed the collector base and was sought after multiple times in the previous game? Eh, maybe they were cloaked? Can the Normandy do that? Or maybe the blue paint job threw them off.<br/>___</p><p>Other than that, there was a lot more going on in the background and more interesting camera angles during dialogue scenes, so it felt more engaging than a simple flat profile shot. There was a lot more action oriented things going on, and now you can jump and climb ladders and what not. Heavy Melee attacks, too.</p><p>The second part of the demo felt more like actual Mass Effect, than the opening bit. I played this last year at PAX, and it has not changed since then. In this scene, you have Wrex, Garrus, and Liara meet up with Mordin, and you do story related things.</p><p>I REALLY want to see what this mission is like if you have Wrex and Mordin killed off from the previous games. Would you even have the opportunity to have this mission? Both characters seem rather integral in order to complete it, or even access it to begin with. Maybe you'd have Grunt instead of Wrex? What happens if you have everyone dead, except yourself. Do they just swap out NPCs instead of storyline charcters? Unfortunately selecting "Numerous Deaths" at the beginning of the demo when it asks you who died in the previous games still has Wrex, Garrus, and Mordin at this part of the demo.  :(<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect 2 results" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-2-results">Mass Effect 2 results</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 16, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This past weekend I finished my second playthrough of Mass Effect 2 in anticipation of the upcoming release of Mass Effect 3.  After picking it up after leaving it for a year and half, I'm amazed at how engaging and rich the entire experience still is.  It's a fantastic game, and definitely my favorite new game to come out of this gaming generation.</p><p>My character has remained consistent throughout the events of Mass Effect 1 and 2.  My Shepard, Jane Shepard, has been a Paragon in most cases, and able to talk herself out of any problem.  She's also been incredibly thorough, completing all side missions, and collecting nearly everything spanned across the galaxy.  Well prepared and powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Wish Fulfillment</b></div><p>Around the release of Mass Effect 2, Anthony Burch (of Destructoid fame, at the time) released two videos talking about decisions and possible decisions you can make in the game depending on how consistent and thorough you play it.  The videos are from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml">January 27th, 2010</a>, and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml">February 3rd, 2010</a>.</p><p>I'm not that big a fan of that obnoxious website, but both these rants brought up the idea of Wish Fulfillment in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.  If you want something bad enough, you can have it!  You can have your cake and eat it, too.  If you want this character to live, you can play the game to the point where they will live.  Want all characters to live?  You can do that too!</p><p>There was one point where you had to make a decisions between two team mates, and one or the other was going to die.  It's the only scene between the two games where you can't have your cake and eat it, too.  It wasn't really a tough decision for me, though, because I didn't really like either character.  And so far, the consequence has been nothing but a palette swap.</p><p>But in Mass Effect 2, you can get on everyone's good side, and have everyone be happy with each other, despite the natural conflicts between some of the characters.  As Anthony mentions in the second video, when characters are fighting and it makes you choose, it should actually make you choose one over the other, rather than choosing some dialogue where both are still your friends.</p><div class='title'><b>Consequence</b></div><p>The idea of Wish Fulfillment dances around the fact that actions have consequence, and we aren't seeing any of these consequences.  That's what Mass Effect's continued Save File persistence throughout the series is supposed to represent.  If you make a decision in a prior game, those decisions come back to bite you in the ass.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 didn't penalize you for making decisions in the first game.  The overall story of ME2 didn't change.  The only thing that changed were certain dialogue choices, and some random people from the first game may make an appearance.  Here's the list of all choices in Mass Effect 1 that had bearing in Mass Effect 2: <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer" title="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer" title="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer">Save FIle Transfer on Mass Effect Wikia</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect 3 needs to have these consequences finally come to life.  They say they're going to, but they actually have to do it.  And not only that, but make some of your "good" paragon decisions thrown back in your face.  The Paragon/Renegade system isn't about Good v. Evil, it's about Nice v. Mean.  So far you could be either, and it didn't matter.  There needs to be a clear distinction that a Paragon choice you made in the past was wrong, rather than (possibly) making all the Renegade choices wrong.</p><p>Entire areas of the game need to be inaccessible depending on the choices you've previously made.  Certain quest lines should only be available based on your decisions.  And even certain allies in the past, should now become enemies because of something you did.  Mass Effect 3 should be a radically different experience for those who have played through the previous games, rather than just a different character saying different things in place of another character.</p><div class='title'><b>Romance</b></div><p>Romance has been a big part of Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 3 is (supposedly) when all your choices come to fruition.  As male or female Shepard you have 2 choices on who you can get involved with in Mass Effect 1.  In Mass Effect 2, you have 3 choices for either gender, and neither of these choices are the same from the first game.  In ME2, you can cheat on your lover from the first game.</p><p>Well, that's what I did on my first playthrough.  As Female Shepard, I definitely went for Liara, the blue female alien, and then I cheated on her.  I think it was more for curiosity sake if anything because a romance between Female Shepard and Garrus was completely ridiculous.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons I wanted (or needed) to play Mass Effect 2 a second time through was because Liara had a prominent role in a DLC mission, and I wanted to make things right.  The Shadow Broker DLC pack allowed our relationship to continue in Mass Effect 2 in a cute scene aboard the Normandy.</p><div class='title'><b>Alternate Lovers</b></div><p>Outside of those 3 romantic choices in Mass Effect 2, there are 3 (or 4) other instances where you can get physical with other characters.  One of these can only happen if you're male Shepard, and it's with Jack during some random conversation.  The other 2 options are with Samara and Kelly Chambers, both of which I did in addition to Liara in my game.  Like all romances, the more you talk with the character, the more you bond, and the eventual romantic options start to crop up.</p><p>With Kelly, keep talking with her after missions, and eventually you will have the option to invite her up to your quarters for dinner.  This is also beneficial because she was automatically feed your fish for you.  After you complete the final mission, and both of you are alive, talk with her again.  She'll send you an email after the conversation about some private time in your quarters.  Go up to your quarters, and invite her up using the comm system on your desk.</p><p>With Samara, if you continue talking with her after missions, the final step is when she starts to ask about how you feel about her.  You can say "just friends" or "something more" or something like that.  Steer the conversation towards trying to seduce her.  She'll ultimately reject you, but leave her quarters.  You'll find her in the crew quarters next door looking out the window at the FTL drive.  If you talk with her, her response is simply, "Please?"</p><p>I guess there's a fourth alternate romance option, and that's with Morinth.  You can talk her into having sex with you, but this kills you instantly because she's an Adart-Yakshi.  This romance cannot persist because it's Game Over.</p><p>Anyway, after continuing my romance with Liara, then going after Samara, and getting physical with Kelly, the photo of Liara is still standing in Shepard's private quarters.  This photo (on your desk) is your romance from the first game, and if this is tipped over, that means you've cheated.  So, despite sort of cheating on Liara this time, the game doesn't think I've cheated.</p><p>Hopefully this will come back at me in the next game, or at least be touched upon.  If anything, I can say that I've done every possible lesbian relationship on a single save.  High Five.</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect 3</b></div><p>Mass Effect 3 is a mere 3 weeks away!  I'm excited.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DJ Promo #3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dj-promo-3">DJ Promo #3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 11, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last year, I DJed at a friend's party and made a couple of DJ Promos to commemorate and practice for the occassion. Both of those are available on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock">Soundcloud</a>, and I wrote a post about them: <a href="/old/v7/dj-promos" title="/dj-promos" title="/dj-promos">October 14th</a>.</p><p>With 2 months spacing my two previous mixes apart, I figured that I would continue to make a new promo every 2 months.  That fell through when I didn't have internet for 3 months and wanted to download and use some new favorites, rather than the stuff I already had downloaded.  And then I got a new laptop, and had to reinstall and transfer things over to that.  And I was playing Skyrim every day for 6 hours in the month of December, too.</p><p>So, I skipped December, and here we are in February :)</p><div class='title'><b>Kind of Wintertime!</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp"  /></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="100%" height="81" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36255553&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" height="81" src="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36255553&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object> <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003">DyreSchlock 003</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock">dyreschlock</a></span></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 003.mp3</a></p><p>1.

Max Cooper - Heresy (Dosem Remix)<br/>9. Spooky - Belong (Igor Cold Unofficial Remix)<br/>10. Slacker - Hymn to Her (Lank Bootleg)</p><p>There were some clear cut songs I wanted to include in this mix.  I wanted to end on Spooky - Belong, and I wanted to start with Shades of Marble (Trentmoller Remix).  Almost everything in between came from experimenting with other tracks, and just seeing what worked together.  Originally, I wanted to end on Orbital's new track "Never", but in its current 3 minute state, it is a difficult one to mix into.</p><p>I added Slacker - Hymn to Her at the end as a farewell to DJ Slacker, who <a href="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/" title="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/" title="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/">passed away</a> in Thailand a couple weeks ago.  I wasn't super familiar with his work, but after listening to some of his tracks, I guess I knew him a little better than I thought.  I remember hearing his music from sets back in the day, and occassionally at The Quest in Minneapolis.  Hymn to Her is definitely my favorite and most recognizable of his, and I found a nice cut of it on Lank's Soundcloud.</p><p>My initial impressions with this mix were a little negative.  It didn't feel like it had an overall message, and it was just a bunch of tracks kind of thrown together.  But as I listen to the results over and over again, I think it turned out pretty well.  I think all the tracks at the beginning flow pretty well, and everything leads up to Henry Saiz's monster remix of Aurora Borealis.</p><p>Give it a listen, and let me know what you think :)</p><div class='title'><b>More mixes</b></div><p>My goal is to continue making these mixes every 2 months. Â Whether it be tracks I hear in the next two months, or some more favorites from years past, I plan on putting something together.</p><p>For me, mixing tracks (or attempting to mix tracks) is a good way of actually feeling how the music actually works with each other, rather than just listening to a single track on its own.  I'm not a DJ, nor do I really claim to be, so I don't really think about music in this way right off the bat.  I might think that two songs sound good together, but in practice they might not jive at all.</p><p>When I'm mixing these tracks together, I'm not doing anything fancy.  I'm really just using the cross fader, and letting the songs naturally mix together.  It's a pretty basic way to do things, and I'm doing it this way because I'm not familar enough with DJ software to do otherwise.  I'm really just sequencing tracks, rather than mixing them together.</p><p>But it forces me to make good decisions, and promote a natural layered flow through the mix.  So far so good.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Part 3 - Local Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-3-local-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Part 3 - Local Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The local scene has exploded over the last year, and we've actually been able to get some international talent as well thanks to the loyal scene in Madison.</p><p>Many events are pretty mainstream, but there are plenty of dudes in the area who have been DJing for more than 10 years, and know exactly where the music today comes from, and what makes the past so special, too.</p><p>Here are my favorite events I attended in town put on by some of the best talent in the Midwest.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Demetri Nocturnal, Psycotron, Scatter @ Poor Boy's Rave, Segredo // Dec 22nd</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/">http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/</a></p><p>No event was more surprising, or amazing than the second to last Poor Boy's Rave of the year.  It was a night of modern Psytrance that continued to be infused with classic Trance hits from the late 90s and 2000 until that beautiful classic sound took over completely.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp"  /></p><p>After Wyatt's opening set, Scatter took the stage and set the mood was some groovy Psytrance beats.</p><p>I don't pay attention to this genre at all, but it was very different than the Hallucinogen and Infected Mushroom I was told were representative of this genre.  Modern day Psytrance (at least according to these guys) was very similar to the classic sound of Trance I was in love with back in the day.</p><p>Scatter continued to hold that classic sound but with a harder edge.  Pyscotron picked up exactly where Scatter left off, but his sound became more melodic and dreamy.</p><p>Demetri Nocturnal took the stage and played a set that was straight out of the year 2000.  I haven't heard these songs in YEARS.  It was like listening to Paul Oakenfold in his prime.  This was exactly the sound I heard in clubs when I first started going out, and the sound that I had completely forgotten about.  It was the reason I went out back in the day, and the reason I have such love for Electronic Dance Music these days.</p><p>I never thought I'd hear this again, and this is why it was the most amazing moment I had in Madison throughout the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>2. The Gimp @ Jump Around, The Cardinal // July 27th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/">http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/</a></p><p>Likewise, one night in July, the Milwaukee Noise Collective was invited to spin at Wyatt's monthy event at The Cardinal, Jump Around.  This was a week before Caleb's big summer party, and I was gearing up to DJ that party all night long.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp"  /></p><p>A couple DJs started off the night, but when The Gimp, aka Brandon Standal, took over the decks the atmosphere completely changed.  It was another set infused with classic DJ tracks that I hadn't heard since the year 2000, and it built a wonder sound.  I was so happy to be with a bunch of my friends at the time.  This was the sound I wanted to bring to Caleb's party.</p><p>Brandon built up the atmosphere with several tracks and then slammed us with Above &amp; Beyond - On a Good Day.  The original Club Mix, not the slightly harder Metropolis mashup.  It was euphoria.  A perfect blend of old and new.</p><div class='title'><b>3. The Horrorist @ Inferno // May 14th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/">http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/</a></p><p>This party was definitely the drunkest I had been all year.  My friends and I somewhat pre-gamed at the Come Back Inn with some Boots.  I slammed some Red Bulls, and we went off to Inferno shortly after.  I was drinking Spotted Cow all night, one after the other.  After the event ended, everyone went across the street to an after party on the second story of some supply store.  And we continued partying for another 2 hours probably, I dunno, I don't remember.  I probably got home around 5am?</p><p>All the opening DJs put an entertaining sets that really set the mood for the night.  Some very hard tracks, mostly Electro House and Techno.  As time progressed and the headliner loomed, the sound become very focused on Techno, and continue to bang pretty hard.</p><p>The Horrorist took the stage and started laying down tracks.  He picked up the microphone and provided all the vocals himself.  He yelled and screamed into the mic along with the beat, and the crowd went absolutely crazy to it.  We yelled at the top of our lungs back at him.  YEAHHH!</p><p>Aside from being drunk and manic due to beer and Red Bull, it was definitely the most energetic party I've ever been to in Madison.  The crowd was completely in tune with his performance, and after Inferno closed, the vibe continued at the after party.</p><p>Despite how ridiculously drunk I was, I remember so much of that night.  It's crazy how incredible and unique that night was that it shown through any attempts of memory blindness. Also, it was great to have company with me so we could piece the evening together at a later date.  It was my favorite drunken night of the year :)</p><p>I think that funniest thing about this was that on Monday, I found out that they recorded the audio from the entire night.  After listening to set performed by The Horrorist, it really didn't sound all that great.  It was a fantastic night, but the majesty of it all was really in his stage presence and ridiculous amount energy pumping up the crowd.  That kind of thing doesn't translate to audio so well. :/</p><p>It was a night that you truly had to be there to experience it all.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Alex Hall @ Wobble, Electric Earth // Halloween</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/">http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/</a></p><p>Alex Hall is a member and featured artist of one of the music forums that I've frequented for quite a while now.  Hybridized.org specialized in Progressive Trance, and Progressive Breaks mostly.  The have huge acts such as Hybrid and Way Out West, but these days focuses a whole lot more on rising talent across the world.</p><p>Alex Hall became a member around the same time I found the forums, but I had no idea he lived in the midwest!  I came across his name on this event, and made it my mission to be in attendance.</p><p>A lot of the Wobble crew threw down some groovy sets, but mixed in some occasion medicore tracks.  One of the openers had some amazing classic Acid House tracks, but then mixed them into Skrillex, bleehhh.  One of the other openers started off with some Drum 'n Bass, and Alex Hall yelled out from the back room, "Drum 'n Bass is for pussies!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp"  /></p><p>Alex Hall took the stage as Satan.  This was the same night Wolfgang Gartner was at Segredo, and Alex's opening remarks were, "Who needs Wolfgang Gartner!  Let's Party!".</p><p>He spun a modern techno set with plenty recent huge hits including Pryda - Moksha and Eric Prydz - Personal Jesus.  It was great to hear such big name sound coming from a Wisconsin resident.  He ended on Mike Koglin - Enjoy the Silence and absolutely blew my mind.</p><p>It was a remarkable Halloween night.  Far better than what Wolfgang would've offered. :)</p><div class='title'><b>5. Wyatt Agard</b></div><p>@ The Cardinal (closing out a dead night)<br/>@ Segredo (opening for Halo)</p><p>Through the year, Wyatt has put on a ridiculous amount of shows.  He DJs at various gigs at least 3 or 4 times a week, and sometimes every single day of the week.  He puts on special events at The Majestic, holds a monthly show at The Cardinal, and weekly shows at Jolly Bobs, and Segredo.</p><p>Wyatt's an amazing dude, and there were two moments throughout the year that really popped for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp"  /></p><p>One late summer's eve at The Cardinal, the place was pretty much dead.  There was a bunch of people there at one point, but never more than 30 people on the dance floor, and eventually they all left leaving me alone out there to groove along.  Wyatt mixed in some of the amazing tracks throughout his set, and built a very progressive vibe.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo">Booka Shade - Regenerate (Pan Pot Remix)</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8">Moby - Pale Horses (Gui Boratto Remix)</a>, and some mashed up remix of Xpander (or at least it sounded like it.)</p><p>These were all tracks I had been groovy to over the summer, and it was great to hear them live. :)</p><p>Later on, when opening up for Halo Varga, he spun another fantastic Prog set.  And even managed to mix in an actual remix of Xpander, most likely the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8">Funkagenda Remix</a>.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/29">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/27">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
