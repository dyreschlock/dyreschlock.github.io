It's about a 15 minute drive whether it's by highway, or by country roads.  Kiyomi is a very narrow village.  The Seseragi Road travels the entire length of the village from it's most southern point to the center of the town in the northwest.  Another road goes directly east from there covering the rest of the village.  It's about an hours drive to cover all of Seseragi, but it shows just how stunning beautiful the nature of the Japanese mountains can be.  </p><p>I recently did a report about Kiyomi.  There's about 3000 residents.  The main industry of Kiyomi is farming, of which most are dairy farmers.  Turns out there are actually more cows in Kiyomi than people.  There's more than 5000 registered cows.</p><p>98% of Kiyomi is heavily wooded and mountainous terrain.  As their website states, Kiyomi is mostly wilderness, and everything else is inhabited by close and loving families of farmers.  Any random person you talk with in Kiyomi will mention how great Kiyomi is for being with family.</p><p>But, in that 98% wilderness, there are some beautiful hiking trails, camp grounds, and waterfalls, too.  In November, it still hadn't snowed yet.  It was still too warm.  On this rainy day, I went to visit one of the more popular and easily accessible waterfalls of Kiyomi, the Okura waterfall.</p><p>It's about an hours hike from Seseragi up the mountain to where the Okura waterfall has its largest cliff.  Throughout the hike, you follow the stream of water it produces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to September Rain" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/september-rain">September Rain</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I teach in Takayama City in the Gifu prefecture of Japan.  Like many places, Takayama has many unique qualities that set it apart from other areas in Japan.  One of these unique qualities is that Takayama is the largest city in Japan by area.  It is 2178 km<superscript>2</superscript>, which is the size of most counties in Wisconsin.</p><p>It was only recently that this happened, too.  In 2005, there was some government restructuring, and several neighboring villages became under the Takayama Municipality.  These are the villages of Shokawa, Kiyomi, Kokofu, Nyukawa, Miya, Kuguno, Asahi, Kamitakara, and Takane.  Their government offices became branches of Takayama, and Takayama's government now ran these towns, too.  Or something like that.</p><p>Despite having such a large land area, there's only 92,000 some people living here.  And only 60,000 or 70,000 people in the central Takayama city.  The outer lands of Takayama have a lot of mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods in the valleys connected by narrow winding roads.  The most distant and ill-populated of which is Takane.</p><p>Even at the time of the merge, Takane didn't even have 1000 residents.  Wikipedia says they had 780 in 2003.  But, they were still their own municipality, complete with its very own Elementary and Junior High schools.  At least they did until 2007.  2 years after the Takayama merge, with such few students, they closed those schools down.  And the school children of Takane now take a bus to the next village over, Asahi.</p><p>Over the summer, I wanted to visit Takane, and see what this forest oasis looked like, and I went with new ALT Simona who had just arrived in Japan 2 weeks prior.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" /></p><p>And this is basically it.  After driving through some thick forests, and windy mountain roads, there are a few houses, a couple of buildings, and then the forests open up a little bit, and you're greeting with the post office.  Takane is a very vertical village.  The residents shaved off a side of the one of mountains, and set up town.  There's a ryokan, city hall, the post office, several houses, rice fields, and a few apartment buildings.  But, there's really no commerce at all.  No convenience store.  Not even a grocery store.  I think there was a liquor store, though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" /></p><p>This place reminds me of LOST.</p><p>Most of the traffic through the town are logging trucks heading up river to the logging camps past the massive dams.</p><div class='title'><b>Takane JHS / <span class='ja'>高根中</span></b></div><p>Tucked away on the ends of the town were the former schools.  Takane JHS was near the center of the town.  Anyone living in town could easily walk there.  It's on the other side of the valley, and mostly visible from the town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" /></p><p>Most of the school was abandoned and no longer cared for.  The foot lockers in the entrance way were all torn up.  And the inside of the gym was dirty and probably hadn't been visited in over a year.  Out back was the incinerator, and changing rooms which had plenty of rust and wood damage.</p><p>Though, right next to the gym was a "gate ball" arena, so the elderly people in town were still coming up here on a regular basis.  (Gate ball is very similar to croquet)</p><div class='title'><b>Takane ES / <span class='ja'>高根小</span></b></div><p>On the way into and out of town is Takane ES.  Unlike the Junior High, this building still showed plenty signs of use.  Looking in the windows, we could clearly see that the Home Ec. room was completely clean and well kept.  The village probably still holds cooking classes for the residents.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" /></p><p>The most interesting part of the elementary school was the student entrance.  Across the 4 windows of the entrance were goodbye messages written by the students in the final year of the school.  The school's student must've been divided into 4 groups for doing activities, and cleaning, and whatever.  Each group got to write their messages on a window.</p><p>Many of the messages say <span class='ja'>いつでも</span>Happy (Always Happy), and <span class='ja'>高小サイユー</span> (Takane ES Goodbye).  It's hard to tell exactly how many students attended the school in its last year, but from counting the messages, maybe 30 or 40 students were there.</p><p>It's cute, and sad, but amazing that all these messages are still there 6 years after the fact.  A record.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 6 Months in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/6-months-in-japan">6 Months in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

My life is certainly different these days than it was a year ago.  Many things have changed, but I think I'm still pretty much the same.  It's quite a bit of fun.  There's always something new at school each day.

| May 25, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, I completed my online certification for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, or TEFL, and I got a fabulous piece of paper saying that much.  Certifications are fine, and all, but they really don't mean a whole lot unless you actually learn something from the course, and can apply that knowledge to your life.</p><div class='title'><b>Goals</b></div><p>I had two reasons for taking this course.  My ultimate goal was to use this knowledge and experience to get a job as an ALT in Japan through the JET Program.  Having a TEFL certificate would help my chances to get the job.</p><p>After applying and interviewing for the position, I felt very inexperienced and novice as a teacher.  So, while having a simple certificate saying I was TEFL certified might help me get the job, and I actually needed the knowledge and experience so I could actually do the job once I got it.</p><p>I looked to this course for guidance, definition, and technique.  And, I really took this course in two parts.</p><div class='title'><b>Taking the Course</b></div><p>For the first lessons, there was plenty of definition.  While it seemed like a lot of obvious information, it was clear and verbose.  There were plenty of questions that I could answer, but never really thought about that much in depth before.  A teacher must be knowledgeable, patient, energetic, adaptive, and a learner.  They must be a manager, organizer, resource, model, and tutor.</p><p>When I made it to Unit 9, that's where technique, lesson planning and execution, was introduced into the course.  And this is also where I stopped for about 4 months.  The JET program had finally accepted me, and I was going to Japan!  When I got to Japan, I was very nervous.  Even though, I had plenty of definition, it's really no substitute for experience or training.</p><p>I fumbled along in classes, but I tried my best.  I made sure to keep eye contact, keep a sharp authoritative voice, be consistent, and be a model for the students.  The definitions I had learned were in my mind, and I tried to stay true to them as best as I could.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>When I finally picked up Unit 9 again, I was absolutely amazed at how useful all the information on lesson planning had become to me.  All the information up to Unit 9 felt very nice to have, and good in theory, but didn't really help me in a concrete way.</p><p>From Unit 9 on, all the planning, and structure helped me build my own lessons for my classes.  It was fantastic.  Most of my initial lesson plans fell a little flat, and didn't really have any flow.  Once I started going through all the Units, my lesson plans became pretty solid, and I felt like the students really took away something in class.  They had fun, and left with a smile. :)</p><p>I feel like I was able to get all 3 things I wanted from this course.  I found plenty of definition in the beginning.  Once I was able to put this course to use, all the techniques I learned were incredibly helpful.  And after completing this course, I have all the answers to go back through whenever I need guidance, and just a reminder on what I should be doing in class.</p><p>So while I got piece of paper that says I'm a TELF certified, I feel I have the confidence and knowledge to back it up, and that's what I needed from this course.</p><p>And, as a final test of that knowledge, I had to write an essay about teaching for a number of available topics.  So, I choose and wrote about the following:</p><div class='title'><b>The Role of a Teacher</b></div><p>The role a teacher plays in the lives of students is significant.  The teacher's role in the classroom is of obvious importance, but the job of a teacher isn't over when class finishes, or when school is over for the day.  A teacher is a teacher all hours of the day, all days of the week.  They are ambassadors of education, and the most important roles for a teacher are to be a manager, an organizer, a resource, a tutor, and a model.</p><p>One of the most important roles a teacher must be is a manager.  A teacher needs to take control of the class, and chart its course for success.  They need to command respect of their students, and let them know they're in charge.  That doesn't mean you must "rule" with an iron fist, though.  Be strict, but be patient, kind, and always listen to your students.  The class isn't about you.  It's about them.  Knowing their needs will make you an effective manager.</p><p>The backing behind an effective manager is being able to organize your class.  A teacher needs to be able to give instructions to their students, and have them able to complete work for themselves.  A teacher needs to keep their students on task and focused on the subject.  And a teacher needs to know how to use the classroom to promote learning of the subject.</p><p>However, a teacher must always be there for their student when they run into a trouble.  As a resource, the teacher is their primary source of material for the course, and should have the ability to answer any question the student has.  This doesn't mean that the teacher needs to know everything.  A good teacher must be a student, too, and always be hungry for knowledge.  They need to have the resources themselves to find out more, and demonstrate that new knowledge to the students.</p><p>As a resource, you help out those most curious, but as a tutor you help out those in need the most.  The role of a tutor promotes trust among the students, and let's them know that no one is left behind.  The teacher will always be there for them, and they can always ask questions.  In a teacher's life, the students must always come first.  It's your mission to see that they all succeed and flourish.</p><p>And lastly, while being a manager holds great importance in the classroom, I think that being a model is the most important role for a teacher.  The students must come first, but holding yourself to the same standard you expect of them should come to a near second.  Students look to you as an example, and you need to provide them with an exemplary one.  A teacher needs to have confidence in themselves, and their knowledge of the subject to be taken seriously.  If you don't have confidence in yourself, then students won't have confidence in you.</p><p>I think it's the most important role because it doesn't end when class or school is over.  Students are around you all the time, so you must be a model citizen, too.  Your behavior in real life must be consistent with your behavior in the classroom, or else the students will lose confidence and faith in you as a person.</p><p>All 5 of these roles build a very well rounded teacher.  A tutor and resource build trust and confidence.  A manager and organizer build respect and structure.  And a model shows them how to use their knowledge and enlighten their lives.  I've been a teacher for 3 months now, and I make sure to inhabit these 5 roles at school and in my daily life.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ikibina Matsuri" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ikibina-matsuri">Ikibina Matsuri</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 5, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On April 3rd, the village of Miya, just south of Central Takayama City, hold a festival called Ikibina Matsuri, or, The Living Doll Festival.  I didn't really know anything about this festival beforehand.  I heard about it from my friend Ikuko, who was very interested in it, and wanted to visit and attend.  So, she did, and we went!</p><div class='title'><b>Hina Matsuri</b></div><p>The Ikibina Matsuri is a regional version of the Hina Matsuri.  The Hina Matsuri takes place on March 3rd, and celebrate's Girl's Day, or, sometimes, Doll's Day.  For Hina Matsuri, families will cover shelves with a red carpet and display dolls on them.  Many people associate this holiday with the beginning of Spring, and the start of warmer days ahead.</p><p>But, for the Hida Takayama area, Winter is still very strong, and the snow doesn't start melting for another month, at least.</p><p>For Hina Matsuri, I went to the Hida Folk Village in town, or Hida no Sato.  This village is a half-preserved, half-recreated area from a few hundred years ago.  All the homes represent the style of architecture at the time.</p><p>As you can see, it was still very much Winter on March 3rd up here.  There's no hint of Spring at all.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" /></p><p>But, they still displayed all the dolls in the houses.  Spring will come eventually!</p><div class='title'><b>Ikibina Matsuri</b></div><p>Since it's still Winter on March 3rd, the Hida Takayama area waits for one month, and has their own celebration on April 3rd, instead.  And rather than arranging a bunch of dolls on a red-carpeted display, young women and kids from the surrounding towns wear the outfits of the dolls, and parade around town.</p><p>Ikuko and I arrived in Miya around 10am.  All of the snow in the area had melted, but it was still rather cold and miserable.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" /></p><p>It rained almost all day. :(  Usually, the parade will begin at the shrine, and continue down the street, along the river.  Then cross the river, and come back to the shrine.  Since it was raining, they restricted the parade to inside of the shrine, instead.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1262.webp" /></p><p>So, all of the people that came to watch the parade were shoved inside of the Ichinomiya Minasha Shrine.  The parade started on one end of the shrine, and all the women and kids moved around the hallways bordering the area.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1294.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1347.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1347.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1372.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1372.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1372.webp" /></p><p>The parade has several princesses dressed in pink, some kids, guards, a king and a queen.  The went around the inside of the shrine a few times.  When the parade was finished all of the cast enters the shrine to pray.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1423.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1423.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Hyouka</b></div><p>So, when I first came to Takayama, I went around to a bunch of the touristy places in town.  I kept seeing all these anime posters on the walls of stores, and museums.  They were all for the same anime, and they advertised Takayama.  So, upon further inspection, these posters mentioned a title: <b>Hyouka</b>.  Later, I looked it up on the Internet, and not only is it an anime, but the whole takes place in Takayama.</p><p>The anime centers on 4 high school students that go to Hida High School, a few blocks away from where I live. :)  Many locations in town are represented almost perfectly in the show, so it was really neat to watch that show when I first arrived.  Some of it was like an introduction video. :)</p><p>Overall, the show is OK.  It's not the best anime, but it doesn't suck.  The plot of the show centers are 4 high school students as they revive a literary club at the school, and then solve mysteries, instead.</p><p>I bring this up because for the final episode of the TV show, the main girl character, Eru Chitanda plays the lead in the Ikibina Matsuri.  So, the whole episode focuses on the festival, and a dumb mystery to solve.</p><p>Because of how accurate Hyouka represents areas in Takayama, the festival and the Ichinomiya Minasha Shrine was depicted rather well.</p><p>Here's a shot from the TV Show:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" /></p><p>And here's a photo I took:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" /></p><p>They're pretty close :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" /></p><p>That's the inside of the Shrine and the outside.</p><div class='title'><b>Satomi Satou</b></div><p>Eru Chitanda is voiced by Satomi Satou, who apparently a big deal since he also voiced a character in K-On, which is very popular.

| December 6, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A couple of weeks ago, legendary DJ Richie Hawtin came to Madison on his CNTRL Tour, which comes with the title "Beyond EDM".  The Beyond EDM moniker is the driving force behind this tour, and has several meanings behind itself.</p><p>Initially my thoughts were that "Beyond EDM" meant an exposure to other genres outside of the massive popularity of Electro House, Dubstep, Pop House, some Trance, and everything you hear on the radio, in most clubs, and so forth.  Many of the new kids to the scene don't realize the rich history and beautiful sounds of true House, Techno, and other more minimal genres that built the scene back in the day.</p><p>But, aside from exposure, the "Beyond EDM" meant something else, and something more.  In the strictest sense, "Beyond EDM" means there's more than just the music.</p><p>"Beyond EDM" means connections.  The wonderful thing about nearly all of electronic dance music is the community that supports it.  For those who are fans, it's about connecting with other fans and artists, supporting them, and sharing music.  For those who are artists, it's about reaching your fans, growing your fanbase, connecting with other artists, and supporting them too.  Support and Collaboration.</p><p>The best (and most unique) thing about Richie Hawtin's CNTRL tour was the education and community focus.  Earlier in the evening, Hawtin held a round-table style discussion and lecture at each of his tour stops, completely free.  Hawtin had 3 or 4 other panelists, and they would discuss various topics such as "the business of EDM", "EDM: Now and Then", "The evolving artist", etc.</p><p>In Madison, Hawtin held his lecture at the Madison Media Institute in southeast Madison.  It almost immediately sold out.  Along with Richie Hawtin, Kevin Saunderson, Ean Golden, Gaise, and Kurt Eckes, from Drop Bass Network all sat in front of us all and talked about EDM for about 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6759.webp"  /></p><p>The whole format was mostly question and answer, but the questions were a little bit leading, and were really more like prompts that guided the information the panelists wanted to say.</p><p>And I wrote a bunch of notes...</p><div class='title'><b>Rave Act</b></div><p>The first main topic of the night was history.  With the explosion of EDM today, we need to look at the past to make sure the same mistakes won't happen again.  Electronic dance music was rather prevalent in the late 90s with the rave scene, but it died out.  What happened?</p><p>This question was directed at Kurt Eckes.  Eckes is one of the founders of the Drop Bass Network, a company responsible for some of the largest rave events across the midwest in the mid 90s to the 2000s.  So, what killed his events?</p><p>Kurt had a few answers, but his main answer was the Rave Act, and the negative publicity of raves in general.  The Rave Act basically slammed an event where any illegal substance was found with a massive fine.  Cops would have the authority to raid any event they believed had a substance, and run through everyone there until they found something, or were satisfied enough, and left.</p><p>This was a huge bummer for several reasons.  Kurt admitted that nearly all of the parties he put on were illegal.  They never checked for drugs, and they pretty much didn't care.  After the Rave Act was introduced, it was way too risky to continue the way they were.  Hiring a bunch of security guards was a bummer.  And if, on the off chance, a party attendee brought something, and the Cops raided the place, he'd be slammed by the law.</p><p>Aside from that, other companies that did throw legal parties were still getting busted.  The cops would shut down the music, have everyone on the ground, and comb the place for an hour.  That's not a fun night for anyone, whether or not they actually find something.</p><p>The Rave Act killed the fun, and made everything too damn risky.  And Kurt's personal interest in the business was beginning to wane, and it just felt like too much damn work to go through all the red tape.</p><div class='title'><b>Clubs</b></div><p>One solution to the problem was to move the scene into the clubs.  But this had its own problem.  The club scene is not the rave scene.  Aside from banning illegal substances, clubs had strict operating hours.  Most of the places in the midwest had to close at 3am.  Most raves went until dawn, or even past dawn, continued through the next day, and night.  Raves never stop, but clubs certainly do.</p><p>The Rave kids just weren't into the club scene, so they just didn't go.  And with raves dying out, they had nowhere to go, and basically quit the music scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Shorter Sets</b></div><p>Even the artists had to adapt to the time restrictions.  DJs could no longer spin a 5 or 6 hour set on their own, they only had a time slot of an hour or 2.  True DJs don't play song after song after song, they play a set.  Songs are chosen to build off of each other, and tell a story.  6 hours is plenty of time to tell a story and try out new things.  But now that time has shrunk.  You can't tell a 6 hour story in just one hour.  There's not enough time to build, and have variety.  And instead of having 30 minutes to build up, you only have about 3.</p><p>There's very little time to be creative and flesh out anything new, too.  Hawtin mentioned that he really needs a good 4 hour set to try out new things.</p><p>To tell all that you want to tell, you need to build the intensity much faster with the shorter sets.  The story is condensed, and faster.</p><div class='title'><b>Larger Shows</b></div><p>Richie Hawtin asked the question, "Was the scene blowing up because of Skrillex, or did Skrillex blow up so fast because of how fast the scene grew?"  Obviously both the scene and Skrillex benefitted from each other greatly, but which one really started it?</p><p>Deadmau5 and Skrillex have raised the bar with the amount of production put into their stage performance at their shows.  But with the larger scale shows, this is so many more things that can go wrong.  Everything must be choreographed, and perfect for the show to be a hit.  Failure can be easy, so these DJs don't take as many risks anymore.  They can't.  They have to stick to a schedule, and can't be as flexible.</p><p>In fast, Deadmau5, who never considered himself a DJ in the first, really doesn't consider his artist persona his main job anymore.  He says that his title is an "event driven marketer."</p><div class='title'><b>Music Sales Today</b></div><p>Another big difference between the scene today and yesterday is that Music does not sell the way it used to, which is really due to piracy.  The whole panel really didn't slam piracy at all while they were up there.  Exposure is exposure.  It's just another vehicle to get your music out there and heard.</p><p>Hawtin gave the comparison that the scene was about a tenth of the size back in the day, but they sold about 10 times more records.  Which is incredible to think of.  But!  They were selling actual records.  These days, you can buy a whole album for $2 on the internet (or just pirate it).  And there's a ridiculous amount of competition.</p><p>Piracy is real and the competition, and the artist needs to be aware of these things.  You cannot survive on record sales alone.  You have to go out and perform your music, and personally spread your unique sound.</p><p>Which means you have to think of the whole package when composing music.  You have to know exactly how you're going to play your track, and design the track itself to be heard live.  And, your music ends up being advertising for your live show, and your message.</p><p>That last part is definitely true for me.  These days, if I hear something I like, I seek out the artist, and if I really like what they're doing, I want to see them live.  The live experience is a completely different monster than hearing something on the computer, or the iphone.  It is the whole package.</p><div class='title'><b>Balancing performance and creation</b></div><p>Building music and advertise your music means that you'll be out on the road and in the clubs a lot.  Hawtin finds himself having to schedule time to actually create tracks...  which is difficult.  You can't schedule creativity.  You need to be prepared to act when inspiration strikes.</p><p>And that isn't all that hard these days.  A lot of the music people make is on their laptops, and the very laptops they bring around with them to perform.  Going from studio work to club performance is nearly seamless.  You can perform works in progress, and really craft your tracks on the fly.</p><div class='title'><b>Copy Cats</b></div><p>It's really easy to make music today.  It's great for the artists, but it has opened the door for a lot of imitation and unoriginality.</p><p>You can take someone else's idea and run with it if you like, but people aren't as stupid as you think.  Fans and other artists are very in tune with what they hear and what they like and can spot a fake almost immediately.  They see right through them.</p><p>If you have no substance, authenticity, or originality, then you won't get far.  You have to be you.  Be natural.  Be genuine.  And the distinctiveness will shine with time.</p><div class='title'><b>Technology</b></div><p>The next question asked if anyone on the panel found it difficult to be creative with the massive influx of technology in the scene.</p><p>Hawtin replied with, "Technology opened up music creatively for me."  (or something like that.  damn autocorrect.)</p><p>He posed the question to the audience, "Do you really really care if the DJ is using the sync function on stage?"  Most of the audience basically just said no.</p><p>He continued by stating that Beat Matching is really is more mechanical than creative.  The machines we use today are WAY more precise than a record and a turntable.  DJ no longer have to chase records, and constantly make sure everything is synced up.  Technology today is incredibly liberating.  It gives the DJ peace of mind.</p><p>As such, they're able to be more creative and complex.  Hawtin can blend more than just two tracks together, and build a more unique layered sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6763.webp"  /></p><p>He demonstrated what he meant by that.  He went over to his laptop, and ran some sounds with each other using Traktor.  He had one track supply the baseline, while he blended the melody of two other tracks on top of that, and a fourth track with some samples.  This kind of thing is just not feasible with turntables.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment</b></div><p>The next train of thought went to the environment.  While the music should stand on its own, you're kidding yourself if you don't think the environment doesn't enhance the music.  Whether it be the crowd, or visuals, or being animated on stand, the environment is part of the performance.  It's part of building that moment for the audience.  And for some people, it's the catalyst that launches them into music, and transports them to another place.</p><div class='title'><b>Be Proactive</b></div><p>The scene is build on the idea of DIY, Do It Yourself.  Don't wait for someone to discover you, get out there and do it yourself!  Connect with everyone around you, and build your vision.  Reach out!</p><p>As you build your sound, let people in.  Accept criticism.  Accept help.  And give help back.  Be transparent, share idea, and include those interested around you.  That's how this scene was originally built in the first place!</p><p>Celebrate our diverse opinions, and grow!</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>Experimentation with your inspiration is how you find yourself.</p><p>Saunderson mentioned that one of the first things he ever did was attempt to copy a sound, or copy a feeling.  He would hear something, and try to recreate it from scratch in the studio.  And out of building toward that sound, the feeling, he found his own sound.  It was what he heard, but now it was through his own voice.</p><p>While copying things outright is rather opaque, you need to start somewhere.  Chasing what you like will give you direction.  And through that journey, you will find yourself.  You just need to keep at it.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>There were a couple more topics, but those were all the notes that I wrote down.  Hawtin ended the lecture with a rather inspirational quote, <b>"Dig deeper and continue to explore.  This is an incredible time.  Don't be disillusioned because popstars are making EDM tunes."</b></p><p>These times are pretty exciting.  I've met more people in the last 2 years into this kind of music, that I have ever met before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Majestic</b></div><p>I met up with Bryan after the lecture, we had dinner, and then we went to The Majestic, where the panelists performed.  Ean Golden started off the evening with an eclectic selection of tracks that went back and forth a little too rapidly for me.</p><p>The night began for me when Gaiser took the stage, and performed live.  Beautiful, rich, heavy Techno.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Kevin Saunderson took the stage, and blended some beautiful House tracks together.  Followed up by Richie Hawtin.  Absolutely incredible night.</p><p>The whole package was something truly unique and special: an education and a mind blowing performance.</p><p>Also, I broke my goddamn camera :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_6779.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0398.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0400.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121117_hawtin/IMG_0403.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oktoberfest Label Magnets" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oktoberfest-label-magnets">Oktoberfest Label Magnets</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 18, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, I started working on a project inspired by something my little brother was doing at the time.  For each unique Oktoberfest I was able to purchase and drink, I removed the label from the bottle, attached it to a magnet, and stuck it on my fridge.</p><p>I was able to collect 26 labels last year, and here's the result:<br/><a href="/old/v7/beer-label-magnets" title="/beer-label-magnets">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=1006</a></p><p>I started in the middle of September last year, which is pretty late to start collecting Oktoberfests, so I was ready to find all the ones I was missing this year.</p><p>Generally, Oktoberfest Beers start showing up around the middle of August, and by the time October rolls around, everything that's going to be shipped to stores has been shipped.  Many people consider the idea of Oktoberfest beers running out of stock in October (and September being the primary month) rather ironic given the name.  Even Oktoberfest itself in Germany starts in September, and ends a few days into October.</p><p>But, from the brewers standpoint, it really depends on the summer.  The Oktoberfest brewing process begins in March, and the batches are set to ferment over the summer.  And when they're done when they're done.  The true german name (or classification) of the type of beer, Marzen, makes more sense, as Marzen is german for March.  No matter when they're done, the process starts in March (and sometimes April for later batches).</p><p>Last year, I tried to keep my collecting efforts to local breweries, but I expanded this year to include (almost) anything I could find.  And I found a lot of beers that I missed.  Plus, a few that I tried last year that either changed labels, or recipes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6368.webp"  /></p><p>There's a sample of the amount of beers I've been drinking over the last 2 months.  I've been driving around to all kinds of liquor stores looking for new beers.  I've been to almost all the ones in Madison.  I went up to Minnesota, and drove around a bit.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Chicago, and a couple other places.</p><p>And the results turned out pretty good.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_6364.webp"  /></p><p>I doubled the amount of labels on my fridge.  I think there's a total of 52 up there now.  Milwaukee Brewery Company, Berghoff, and Sam Adams had the same beer, but changed the label.  And New Belgium release a Red Hoptoberfest (not that great :( ) compared to the Hoptoberfest they had last year.</p><p>I arranged all the labels in order by my preference, but with so many beers it's pretty subjective.  And at times difficult to remember which ones tasted better than the others.</p><p>Overall, I would say <b>Sam Adams Oktoberfest</b> is a good middle ground, mediocre Oktoberfest to judge the others on.  Anything better than Sam Adams is a good, tasty Oktoberfest, in my opinion.  When I compare, I usually start there.  If it's better, than I compare it to <b>Leinie's Oktoberfest</b>.  And from there, the process gets a little cloudy.  If it tastes similar to another one on my list, I usually place it next to (or near it).</p><p>By FAR! my favorite beer from this year is the <b>Three Floyds Munsterfest</b>.  It is incredibly smooth, with a deep rustic, autumn feel.  It's not as flavorful or deliberate as the Staghorn, but pretty damn perfect for what I look for in an Oktoberfest. Very similar to Lake Front.</p><p>Also, I had a chance to try <b>Ayinger Oktoberfest</b> which is the first German import Oktoberfest I actually liked.  I think I put it too low on my list, and will have to adjust it next year when I have more opportunities to try it again.</p><p>With the exception of Ayinger, one thing I really don't understand is why all German imported Oktoberfests taste like stale rotten Heineken piss.  They are the absolute worst beers I've had.  And they all taste very similar, so it's gotta be similar to what the Germans actually drink over there, right?  Ayinger rises above that, but still has a tinge of the Heineken taste in it.  I don't understand it.  And maybe the only way to answer this question is to actually go to Germany for Oktoberfest sometime.</p><p>Overall, I found every Oktoberfest I was looking except for one.  I really really want to try <b>Wiehanstefaner Fest Bier</b>.  Wiehanstefaner is my favorite German brewery, and I would imagine their Oktoberfest has got to be pretty good.  Hopefully that will lead me to more answers to why German Fest Biers are horrible and gross.</p><div class='title'><b>Makin' Magnets!</b></div><p>Anyway, making these magnets are pretty easy.  I outlined the process in the previous post, but I'll reiterate it here.</p><p>To remove the label, I use Wine Appeals's Wine Label Removal Kit.<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3">http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O</a></p><p>It's basically just tape that you cover the beer label with.  When you remove the tape, the label will come off with it.</p><p>And then I'm using Super 77 spray adhesive on ProMAG's Paintable Magnetic Vinyl Sheets.  I spray down the sheet, place the labels on top of the sheet, let it dry for a little bit, and then cut them out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5475.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5477.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Pain in the Ass!</b></div><p>Most of the time, the labels come off very easily, but the label for <b>Flying Dog's Dogtoberfest</b> does not!  I wasn't able to find anymore this year, so all I had were 2 empty bottles I saved from last year.</p><p>I tried removing the label very very slowly, but that didn't work.  Too much of the label still stuck to the bottle, and would rip the image.</p><p>I tried filling the bottle with water, cooling it, and let the condensation moisten the label to make it easier to remove.  That didn't work, either.</p><p>So, I tried something else.  I figured if I couldn't remove the label from the bottle, maybe I could remove the bottle from the label.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5539.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5539.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5540.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5540.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5543.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5543.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/121001_oktoberfest/IMG_5543.webp"  /></p><p>That did the trick.</p><p>And even after all that, tiny pieces of the glass still stuck to the label.

| August 27, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I was cruising on ebay the other day, and came across this little gem.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4678.webp"  /></p><p>As you can tell from the picture, it's entitled the <b>Gainax Interviews</b>.  Published in 2005, this is a 536 page book featuring very lengthy interviews with almost everyone remotely noteworthy who has ever been a part of <b>Gainax</b>.</p><p>For those who don't know, Gainax is a Japanese Animation Studio responsibility for such anime movies and television shows as <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, <b>Gunbuster</b>, <b>Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water</b>, <b>Neon Genesis Evangelion</b>, <b>His and Her Circumstances</b>, <b>FLCL</b>, <b>Gurren Lagann</b>, <b>Panty and Stocking</b>, and a couple others, mostly maid anime.</p><p>I've been a fan of Gainax ever since I first watched Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Akira initially showed me how detailed and brutal Japanese animation can be, but Evangelion showed me the amount of depth most anime go into when describing and building a character while still having some amazing animated scenes.</p><p>I watched their other work, and they continued to impress and amaze me.  More over, I began completely amazed by the director and chief creative input behind many of their shows, Hideaki Anno.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4671.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4690.webp"  /></p><p>The book has a sizable interview with him.  I can't really read Japanese (yet), but above the specific question deals with the work he did before he, Takeda, Masayuki, and Higuchi banded together to form Gainax.  He worked as a key animation on the Gundam series for Sunrise, and, as the photo in the corner indicates, he got his big break key animating the God Warrior scene at the end of Ghibli's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.</p><p>Aside from Anno, the book focuses on the interviews of 15 people who helped shape Gainax throughout the years.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4675.webp"  /></p><p><b>Yasuhiro TAKEDA</b> : co-founder, general manager<br/><b>Hideaki ANNO</b> : co-founder, creator of Evangelion, director of Evangelion, Nadia, Gunbuster, His and Her Circumstances, and some others<br/><b>Masayuki</b> : assistant and alternate director of Evangelion<br/><b>Yoshiyuki SADAMOTO</b> : co-founder, character designer for Honneamise, Evangelion, Nadia<br/><b>Toshimichi OHTSUKI</b> : producer of Evangelion, FLCL<br/><b>Hiroki SATO</b> : producer of FLCL and most of their maid anime shows<br/><b>Masahiko OHTSUKI</b> : technical director of FLCL, Evangelion, and some others<br/><b>Shinji HIGUCHI</b> : co-founder, storyboards and special effects for Honneamise, Gunbuster, Evangelion.  Also, special effects director for most of the Gamera films.<br/><b>Shouji MURAHAMA</b> : worked at Daicon Film.  Later founded Gonzo.<br/><b>Yasuhiro KAMIMURA</b> : key animator for Evangelion.  digital artist for FLCL.<br/><b>Kazuya TSURUMAKI</b> : protege of Hideaki Anno, director of Evangelion, FLCL, His and Her Circumstances<br/><b>Tadashi HIRAMATSU</b> : storyboards, and key animator for Evangelion, FLCL, Gurren Lagann, and shit loads more.<br/><b>Takami AKAI</b> : character designer for Daicon III.<br/><b>Shigeru WATANABE</b> : producer of Honneamise and Gunbuster.  Later, did MANY other things.<br/><b>Hiroyuki YAMAGA</b> : co-founder, director of Honneamise</p><p>Also, in the back there's a glossary of a bunch of terms, and other things related to Gainax for quick reference.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4676.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, this book is over 500 pages of first hand accounts and information of the founding, rise, success, and aftermath of one of the most influential Anime studios of all time.  All of which I can't really read at the moment. :(</p><p>This is very similar to another book I own, but from a single point of view.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120827_gainax/IMG_4687.webp"  /></p><p>The Notenki Memoirs is written by one of the co-founders of Gainax, Yasuhiro Takeda, and from the way he writes about it, it seems that he's the responsible one of the four main founders.  Originally published in 2002 in Japan, ADV translated and brought this book over in 2005.</p><p>Takeda talks about meeting Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and Shinji Higuchi in college, and forming an Anime club.  Together they, and a couple other members, worked on an opening animation for the upcoming Sci Fi convention being held in Osaka that year, Daicon III.  The year was 1981.</p><p>The way he talks and reminiscences about their work on Daicon III reminds me of my own time in college in my own anime club, SPAMM, as we worked on a film of our own, The Secret of Crystania (which is really a fandub, not a complete original work).  And much like both of our projects, they were finished only an hour or two before it aired to the public.</p><p>You can view the whole short film on Youtube, as well as the amazing sequel, Daicon IV, that they did 2 years later.</p><p>Daicon III : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLAVWf-N3c</a><br/>Daicon IV : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDBIwRe2AE</a></p><p>With the completion of Daicon IV, they founded Daicon Film which specialized in special effects and animation. Later on, the special effects business splintered off, and the remnants became <b>Gainax</b>. In the beginning, the mostly did animation work for Sunrise (Gundam), but later created original works that I mentioned above.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway...</b></div><p>The Gainax Interviews looks like a fascinating read into the history of my favorite Anime studio, and I look forward to reading it someday.  It's my goal to someday have enough knowledge of the Japanese language to actually read this thing.  Maybe, at that time, I'll actually work to translate the whole thing since it doesn't seem like a translation exists.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Double Fine Adventure" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/double-fine-adventure">Double Fine Adventure</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Out of all the kickstarter projects I've backed and "invested" in, Double Fine Adventure has been the most rewarding and unique experience out of them all.</p><p>Tim Schafer and his pals at Double Fine launched the Double Fine Adventure kickstarter on February 8th this year, and asked for $400,000 dollars to make a game that they've always wanted to make.  And not only that, they planned on filming an episodic documentary about their entire process.  And open up their creative process to the backers of the project for suggestions and ideas on what they might want in the game.</p><p>Here's a link to their Kickstarter campaign:<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure" title="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure</a></p><p>33 days after their kickstarter, it ended at $3,336,372 with an additional couple hundred thousand dollars donated outside of kickstarter.  It was the most successful campaign that kickstarter had seen to date.  The whole games industry took note.  And plenty of other classic game developers took note, and started their own campaigns, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts and Brutal Legend</b></div><p>I've been a big fan of Tim Schafer and Double Fine ever since I played <b>Psychonauts</b>. Psychonauts was the first game I played that Tim Schafer worked on, and playing through that game was an absolute delight (until the final stage).  The comedic dialogue, and funny characters worked themselves perfectly into the story, the game mechanics, and the overall world everything took place in.</p><p>It was one of the most fun and enjoyable experiences I've had with a game in quite a while.  And then they did it all again with <b>Brutal Legend</b> in 2009.  A perfect cohesive experience that carried its vision from start to finish with comedic tones guiding most of the mechanics of the world.</p><p>Not to say that these game aren't flawless.  But when the core concept of a game has a heart behind it, you can see past its flaws.</p><p>I wrote about both these games almost 3 years ago after finishing Brutal Legend<br/><a href="/old/v7/brutal-legend" title="/brutal-legend">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=673</a></p><p>Also, I got my copy of Brutal Legend signed by Tim Schafer!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Afterwards</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Brutal Legend sold terribly, and Double Fine really scaled back their games production.  Since Brutal Legend, I think Double Fine Adventure is the first game that Tim Schafer is actually directing himself.  They've made 5 games since then, and they have been rather small in scope, and mostly championed by other people on the Double Fine staff.</p><p>Tasha Harris, lead animator, directed <b>Costume Quest</b>, which was a cute downloadable game for XBLA, PSN, and Steam.  It featured a brother and a sister trying to save each other (depending on who you play as) from goblins during Halloween.  It was a turn-based RPG, and during the battles the kids would turn into the things they were costumed as for Halloween.</p><p>Lee Petty, art director, wrote and directed <b>Stacking</b>.  Stacking is about a kid trying to find his kidnapped family.  All the characters in the game are Russian Stacking dolls, and since you're the smallest, you can go inside other stacking dolls and use their character specific powers to solve puzzles and eventually rescue your family.</p><p>The Double Fine store sold a bunch of replicas of some of the characters in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp"  /></p><p>Then they did <b>Trenched</b> which was renamed to <b>Iron Brigade</b>.  Lead Designer, Brad Muir, headed up Iron Brigade.  This game is essential tower defense, but with a player playing a role on the field.  Your character pilots a mech and sets up missiles turrets to defend against evil broadcasting monsters.</p><p>The fourth game in this series is <b>Once upon a Monster</b> headed by lead programmer Nathan Martz.  Once upon a Monster stars all the monsters from Sesame Street in a learning game for kids using the Kinect.  According to Wikipedia, this initially wasn't intended to be a licensed game, but everything seemed to fit after working on it for a while.</p><p>All the mistakes and lessons learned from working with the Kinect spawned an unintended fifth game in the series entitled, <b>Double Fine Happy Action Theater</b>.  This Kinect title isn't so much a game, as it is a whole lot of random visualizations and interactions made possible with the Kinect.</p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Adventure</b></div><p>They're currently in the process of working on a game headed by Ron Gilbert, the creator of Monkey Island.  But Tim wanted to work on a game, too.  He hadn't been directly in charge of a game since Brutal Legend, and wanted to do something again.  And rather than shop an idea around from publisher to publisher to publisher getting rejected, he decided to do a kickstarter campaign and see what would happen.</p><p>And success happened.</p><p>And now we're 5 months after the Kickstarter has ended, and they've released 4 episodes of their documentary so far.  The first episode dealt with the creation of the kickstarter and its success.  The second episode dealt with Tim's creation process, and a few ideas he had come up with.  He also went over these ideas with Ron Gilbert, and they talked a little bit about what adventure games meant, and how they should be designed.</p><p>The third episode was Tim bringing his ideas to his team, getting feedback, and working through the feedback.  They also introduced Anna Kipnis as the lead developer, and her team setting up the animation and game engine.  They also came up with the codename for the project, "Reds", as they did the Double Fine pub crawl.</p><p>The fourth episode, released today, was an extended double length episode that focused on the concept artists for the project, and their process.  They introduced Peter Chan, and Scott Campbell, visited their work spaces, and their lives.  They also introduced Nathan "Bagel" Stapley as the lead artist for the project, and showed him off too.</p><p>Each episode has been about a month apart, and has really shown the project taking shape.  From the small ideas that Tim had in episode two, into some fleshed out stories, and concept art in episode four.  Each episode has done a fantastic job focusing on the passion of everyone involved, and especially with Tim himself.  With all the money they raised, he's able to hire all the people he really loves and inspires him to create great things.</p><p>The whole idea with this project has been to create something that was completely outside of publishers.  For his process, publishers tend to stifle and warp his ideas into something that sells, rather than something that comes from the heart.  And even though I feel like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend had plenty of heart, I wonder just how toned down they were from the original idea.</p><p>It's great to see a creative team have all the freedom they want, and have them explain what inspires them, and ultimately what makes them happy.  And given that I've loved almost all of their games, it's really fulfilling and inspiring to me to see it build and come together.</p><p>It's pretty great.</p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Adventure Swag</b></div><p>And additionally, they've actually fulfilled all of their upfront physical goods too.  I pledged $100, which awards a physical copy of the Game and the Documentary in a classic over-sized PC box.  Those will obviously only be available upon completion of the game and documentary, but the upfront goods I got are a Poster, and a T-shirt!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp"  /></p><p>It includes a sticker, and a button too!</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I'm certainly looking forward to all the rest of the episodes.  But!  In the immediate future, Double Fine is going to have a bit of a presence at PAX this year.  They plan on having a booth in the exhibition hall, they are having a panel specifically on Double Fine Adventure, and they are taking part of two other panels.</p><p>Friday @ 1pm : Double Fine Adventure Panel w/ Tim Schafer (Double Fine), Greg Rice (Double Fine), Paul Levering (Player 2 Productions), and Cindy Au (Kickstarer).  They are showing some clips from the documentary and then answering a bunch of questions.</p><p>Saturday @ 7:30pm : Canceled &amp; Prototyped Games w/ Brad Muir (Double Fine), Amir Rao (Supergiant), Dan Teasdale (Twisted Pixel), and Sylvain Dubrofsky (Popcap).</p><p>Sunday @ Noon : Plot v. Play - Duality of Modern Game Design w/ Ben Gilbert (Joystiq), Jason Schreier (Kotaku), Tim Schafer (Double Fine), and Erik Wolpaw (Valve).</p><p>I plan on attending each of one of these, but I especially plan on attending the Double Fine Adventure one.  </p><p>Additionally, The Cave is going to be in the Exhibition Hall at SEGA's booth.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/29">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/27">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
