We checked You-ing and Yamada, but found nothing.  Next we went up the street a little bit, and I showed Gage around Sumiyoshi.  But my little tour was cut short by our feet being reduced to hamburger once again.  It was around 3:00pm and we had already been on our feet since 4:00am.</p><p>We caught a bus and went down to 100 yen sushi.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" /></p><p>100 yen sushi is a rotating sushi restaurant, which kinda like a buffet.  Plates move around the restaurant on a conveyer belt and you just pick up whatever you like.  Each plate is 100 yen, so you eat as much or as little as you like.</p><p>After giving our feet a little rest we went to Yamada in Togitsu, Hard off and Geo and finally found things I was looking for.  I picked up the PSP GPS for $54, the Map pack for $10, Railfan on PS3 for $30, and found some more Capsule toys.</p><p>We finished off the day by visiting Beardo, which was great ^_^.  Nonoka is still really cute, and Nanase is adorable ^_^  All the regulars were there and Clinton stopped by, too.  I also met Henry, a friend of Leigh's, who is currently studying abroad.  I'll take plenty of pictures there when we go back on Thursday.</p><p>On the way back to our hotel, we stopped at Jinya to meet Ryan, who's also back in Nagasaki trying to find work or anything that'll keep him here.  It sounds like JET is a little bloated these days.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mt.

I'll show Gage some of the nifty sight-seeing places like the Atomic Bomb epicenter, Peace Park, probably the Museum too.  We'll probably hit Beardo.  On Tuesday, we'll probably do more of the same but do far more shopping.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ikuko took the day off, so we'll head up to Sasebo to meet her.  I want to check out Hirado castle, which is a little north of Sasebo, and also other places around there where we could find more Sakura ^_^.  We'll spend the night in Sasebo somewhere, probably Cybac or a Karaoke box or something.  Maybe Ikuko has some room at her place.</p><p>On Thursday, we'll head back to Nagasaki but take make some stops in Towns on the way back, like Omura and Isahaya.  Hopefully, Hilary will get back to me about this Italian place, and we'll have some Pizza in Nagayo, too.</p><p>On Friday, we'll head back to Fukuoka and do much much shopping around town.  We didn't really spend a lot of time in stores yesterday, so this'll be the day to make up for that.</p><p>Early Saturday morning is our flight back to the states. :/</p><p>There you have it ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 80s Prom porn @ Inferno" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/80s-prom-porn-inferno">80s Prom porn @ Inferno</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 23, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On Friday, Brett and I went to the Inferno Club in Madison.  To date, there has only been one ocassion where I left the establishment satisfied, which was around two years ago when Richard Divine tore up the place (<a href="/old/v7/richard-divine-inferno" title="/richard-divine-inferno" title="/richard-divine-inferno">here what i wrote</a>).  The other two times at Inferno had been a stark disappointment.  Extremely low turn-outs..</p><p>When arriving at Inferno around 9:45pm, it seemed like I was being setup for disappointment again.  There were maybe a dozen or two people there, most of which were sipping drinks at the bar.  There was one group that was quite into the scene and were on the dance floor.</p><p>Brett and I found a table off to the side and perched ourselves for the night.  Despite having few people around, the track selection was absolutely amazing.  80s dance hit after 80s dance hit.  Amazing song I never remember this well, to several great songs I had never heard before.</p><p>DJ Smitty was the resident all night long and he kep the hits coming along.  His track selection was top notch.  Unfortunately though, he didn't mix any tracks together at all.  When one song ended, it was a quick to the next.  It was like getting punched in the side or pushed into a wall at the end of every song.  ughh..</p><p>I never got used to his hard cuts, but what can you do really?  The genre is 'retro' which covers ALL genres of dance from the 80s and other eras.  Track mixing really didn't become all that prevalent until the 90s..  I would've liked some effort but towards mixing, but all these songs are so radically different, it would probably be disastrous if you weren't already a mixing god.  Oh well...</p><p>The track selection made the night perfect, and as the night went on..  more and more people did begin to show up and started flocking to the dance floor.  The power of delicious 80s tracks truly did bring people into the venue despite Spring Break and a Snow Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" /></p><p>This event was the highest viewed for the month of March on Inferno's website, so I really wonder what kind of crowds this'll draw when it's not Spring Break and the weather is fine.  80s Night at Inferno is the 3rd Friday of each month, so I guess we'll see next time on April 18th.</p><p>April 18th also happens to be No Brand Con, so I won't be able to get any SPAMM friends to go, but if you aren't going up to Eau Claire that weekend, feel free to stop by Madison, ^_^</p><p>Favorite Track of the Night: Ghostbusters Theme ^_^.  Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough for Smitty to play my request of the Beverly Hills Cop Theme.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect - Bring down the Sky" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky">Mass Effect - Bring down the Sky</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Last week, Bioware released the first in a series of downloadable episodes for Mass Effect on the Xbox 360.  Being an adoring fan of Mass Effect I quickly purchased this new $5 episode and finally finished the 3 hour episode a week and a half later.</p><p>Bring down the Sky is a pluggable episode that squeezes itself into the middle of Mass Effect.  It takes place on Asteroid X57 near Terra Nova in the something cluster, which you can reach once you get free rein to explore the Milky Way Galaxy.  You can not access this once you've completed the game, which could be considered a pain in the ass to some players.  It took me about 3 or 4 hours to run through Eden Prime and all the required crap on the Citadel to finally start flying around.</p><p>That's the main reason why I didn't finish Bring down the Sky in one sitting.  All my free time that night was spent getting to the point where I could start it.  Also, I was playing on the insane difficulty, so some things took a little longer than usual.</p><p>In Bring down the Sky, you are faced with a Batarian regime who have taken over the science facilities on Asteroid X57 and have changed the trajectory to collide with Terra Nova, whose colonies consist of some 6 million inhabitants.  Once landed on the asteroid, you can see the brilliant Terra Nova as you loom closer to doom.  It reminds me a lot of Armageddon, actually.  Luckily, you don't need to drill through the surface and destroy the asteroid.  You just need to shut of the thrusters and regain control of the science facilities to fix everything.</p><p>This expansion does feature a couple new Assets to Mass Effect.  The large thrusters bored into the asteroid are new from the download, as well as the Batarians themselves.  We never did get to see the Batarians in the main game, but this expansion does offer reasons why they were left out.</p><p>Overall, Bring down the sky is more robust than the other side quests already in the game.  The experience is tighter and self-contained with actual cutscenes throughout the experience leading you on to the next station.  It has a more theatrical introduction and conclusion, but still keeps a sandbox approach to how you handle the outcome.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>The only complaint I have about Bring down the Sky is the ending.  It really annoys me that you are given 2 choices at the end and you can only do one or the other.  You cannot defeat the extremist leader AND save the hostages he's acquired.  You can do this in all other scenarios throughout the game, but you cannot in this one.  AND, to make matters worse, during the epilogue to the episode, everyone keeps second guessing your choices.</p><p>So, not only can't you do both, but the game judges either decision you make as the wrong one.  I even went back and saved the hostages the second time rather than killing the leader and they STILL are ungrateful.  ARHghaghghgh</p><p>You pay $5 for a few hours of entertainment and there's no scenario where the game won't complain about what you've done.  Maybe I'll go back and kill the hostages again just to shut them up.  At least I get Renegade points for that.. I don't get Paragon points for saving the hostages.<br/>/Spoilers</p><p>Anyways, I'd definitely recommend this if you like Mass Effect and have already completed one play through.  You don't need to beat the game to play this, but if you haven't finished Mass Effect, you should probably do that before you add more content to extend the game.</p><p>Also, Bring down the sky gives you another 50 achievement points ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Coming back to Mass Effect</b></div><p>Coming back into Mass Effect from playing World of Warcraft these past few months was a much needed breath of fresh air.  WOW is so completed void of emotion, it almost completely numbs me to play.  It has tremendous back story and all that, but that's not the point of WOW at all.  WOW is all about the end game level of play, reaching 70 and then actually building your character.  and continuing to build your character.</p><p>There's really no aspect of playing the game how you want because the point is to "be good" at it, and if you don't do little things how you're supposed, everyone starts complaining to you about it.  "You're in the wrong zone", "You're doing worthless quests", "Abandon all those crappy quests", "Put out your buffs", "Why do you have one point in another skill tree".</p><p>I feel no freedom in the game.  I'm really just a slave to how the game is played well.  Which is absolutely the opposite of what I want from an MMO.</p><p>Maybe it's just because I hang out with people who've played the game for the past 4 years its been in the market though, but I constantly miss the type of freedom I felt when playing Ultima Online.  I felt no pressure to do anything in Ultima Online.  I could just run off into the woods and be a hermit if I wanted.  I could build a shack in the woods, outfit it with fencer training stuff and buff my character that way.  I could actually explore the world where no one had ever been, and monsters were very sparse.</p><p>I really can't play World of Warcraft that much anymore..  It's too annoying and gives me a headache whenever I think about it.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, about Mass Effect</b></div><p>Anywho, I started a new game in Mass Effect to be able to play Bring down the Sky.  This is my third play through and I started off on my level 59 character, which was still 100,000 experience away from the game's level cap.  Through the first areas of the game I got up to 792,000, still 68,000 short of the cap.  After finishing the new episode I'm at 820,000, still 40,000 from the cap.  Sigh...</p><p>Also, my game is now on the Insane difficulty which is actually challenging!  It's actually pretty fun to actual use parts of the environment for cover and not being able to run in the middle of battle and kill everyone.  Each skirmish takes a little tact to fish out the enemies into the open to beat them down.  Moving around your party members is actually helpful!  Sweet.  Too bad is takes 50 hours into the game to unlock it.</p><p>I don't see why you have to unlock the more difficult difficulties when the options you have are pretty easy in the first place.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gyakuten Saiban / Ace Attorney Timeline" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gyakuten-saiban-ace-attorney-timeline">Gyakuten Saiban / Ace Attorney Timeline</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>If you've played through any Phoenix Wright game, you may notice that Date and Time stamped onto the beginning of every scene in the game.  When playing through these games.. I wonder..  is it really consistent?</p><p>In the 2nd one, Wright says he's been a lawyer for one year.  In the third one, he's says he's been a lawyer for two years.  So the first 3 games take place a year apart.  And Apollo Justice comes into the scene seven years later.  The third games deals a lot with events both past and present for the whole series.  Apollo Justice does a fair amount of flash-backing too, but it sticks to that 7 year period after the first three games.</p><p>They never really say what year it is though..  but there is one piece of evidence in the entire franchise that places a year on one event, which in turn places a year on all events.  That's the good 'ol DL-6 Incident file from the fourth case of the first game.  The DL-6 Incident took place on December 28th, 2001, 15 years prior to the fourth case.  So Phoenix Wright 1 begins in 2016, Phoenix Wright 2 in 2017, Phoenix Wright 3 in 2018 and 2019, with Apollo Justice in the year 2026.  Weird..  but it makes sense with all the futuristic crap that is subtley put into some cases..  like Godot's visor.</p><p>Anyways, I made a list of events in Gyakuten Saiban series with when they took place and with whom.</p><p><b>UPDATE (9/28/2010)</b>: I'm playing through Ace Attorney Edgeworth or Gyakuten Kenji at the moment, so I'm updating this time line as I go.<br/>_______</p><p>December 28th, 2001<br/><b>DL-6 Incident</b> -

| March 9, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Last Night, I completed Apollo Justice, the fourth game in the Ace Attorney / Phoenix Wright / Gyakuten Saiban game series.  I have some disappointments, but overall I'm quite pleased with the game.</p><p><b>Timeshift</b> (spoiler-heavy)</p><p>The riskiest thing about the game is playing as Apollo Justice, 7 years past the previous game.  This offers a very healthy restart to the franchise and takes the series in a new direction.  Honestly, I think they had exhausted all their options with Edgeworth and the Fey family.  It was time for the series to move forward, rather than backward.  But I think they put a little too much behind them when making this transition.</p><p>Phoenix Wright is in Apollo Justice and is the center of attention, but many of the other characters are gone.  Not a single mention of Edgeworth or the Fey Family.  No Franziska, No Gumshoe.  The only other 'blast from the past' is Ema Skye who was introduced in the DS only chapter of Phoenix Wright 1.  She has taken Gumshoe's place as lead detective.</p><p>I guess it's assumed that Edgeworth and Maya went their merry way elsewhere.  Pearl, too.  I'd like to know what happened.  Maybe that will be the focus of Gyakuten Saiban 5?</p><p><b>New Main Character</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>The thing reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 2.  Phoenix Wright is still in the game, but he's like a mentor / background character for the better part of the game.  It's not until the final chapter, when you play as him, that his whole story takes center stage and shows exactly how Apollo Justice is caught up in it.  Kinda like MGS2.  You start off as Snake, but his story is cut short.  Then all of sudden, you're playing as Raiden and have no idea why until it all becomes clear in the final act.</p><p>I have a feeling Gyakuten Saiban 5 is going to be a lot like MGS4 or perhaps Halo 3, where you have the main characters of the franchise side-by-side using their detective and analytic techniques together.</p><p><b>Perceiving</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>Speaking of which.. Phoenix Wright's detection vice was using the Magatama and discovering Psyche-Locks in people.  Locks that locked memories from the people view that you can unlock by shoving truth into their faces.  Unlocking those memories helped you dig deeper into the truth.</p><p>Apollo Justice has a vice of his own, Perceiving, which, just like the Magatama, is integral to his character's story.  To perceive, Apollo will feel tension in his bracelet which gives him the idea that this person is lying to him.  When perceiving, you look VERY closely at your subject.  You search them for a 'tell' or 'habit' they might do when they're lying.  Once you know exactly what they're lying about, you can use evidence or coercion to force the truth out of them.</p><p>In this game, the only time you perceive is in court.  There is never an instance outside of court that the game allows you to perceive.  But that's where the Magatama comes into play in the final act when uncovering all the mysteries of the past 7 years.</p><p><b>In the series..</b> (no real spoilers)</p><p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the game.  Even though, it missed the mark of the previous characters in the series, it did a great job pulling Apollo Justice and other new characters into the series.  I'm still somewhat annoyed at those chapters that aren't relevant to the overall story, though.  In this case, the second chapter really had nothing to do with the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  Though, I guess it did bring back Ema Skye and plenty of forensic investigation.</p><p>Placing it into the series, though.  I would say Apollo Justice is on par with the first Phoenix Wright game.  Phoenix Wright 3 is my favorite, whereas Phoenix Wright 2 is my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong, Phoenix Wright 2 is essential for the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban, but the music really pulls down the game.  You need to play Phoenix Wright 2 to appreciate all the story in Phoenix Wright 3.</p><p>Apollo Justice is kind of on its own plane though.  You don't really need to play the previous games to appreciate the story.  You could start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice and not be lost or miss anything.  All you'd really need to know is that Phoenix Wright is a good, clever lawyer.</p><p>Though, if you did start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice, you'd totally be spoiled by the 3D aspects.  I would rather hold Apollo Justice as a treat for playing through the first 3 games, than go start for the desert.</p><p><b>Gyakuten Saiban</b> (no spoilers)</p><p>After completing Apollo Justice, I still want more.  I love the characters, the story, the humor, the music.  The whole domestic version of the Gyakuten Saiban series is fantastic.  If you haven't played through them, I ask that you give it another try. ^_^  These 4 games are some of the best the DS has the offer.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 5 is at the top of my hype-wagon ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b><em>Update</em></b></div><p>After peering around, I found some news on Gyakuten Saiban 5.</p><p><em>When Shu Takumi was exclusively interviewed, he said that GS5 will still be on DS and it will be the last one for the series. However, it doesn't mean that there will be no new GS games, but rather the end of stories about Phoenix. After that, GS will become a totally new game and have nothing to do with the old series.</em></p><p><em>He also stated that GS4 was a "test" game. Thanks to the high sale record of GS4, the staff aren't worried about introducing a new story.</em></p><p><em>However, before the new game series can start, the current GS series must come to an end and GS5 will be the farewell show. GS5 will break the record of GS1's DS remake and become the longest one of the whole series. Almost all the old characters will turn up and some hidden clues in GS1234 will be looked on. Some of the cases which seem to have nothing to do with each other will show a connection. In a word, everything will become clear in GS5. What made the players even more excited, Shu Takumi revealed that the final boss of the all darkness is not a fresh face but someone we are quite familiar with! This person control all in the dark, who can he/she be?</em></p><p><em>Shu Takumi also said the most of the script has been finished and the game producing is on its way. There is also a piece of news which may let the players down: it's probably the last time that Shu Takumi will take part in writing the script for GS. From now on, other people will take over his work.</em></p><p>It seems like suspicions are correct.  Number 5 will tie everything together, but it seems it will also end it all.  Oh well.  Rather put a definite end to a story rather than dragging it out forever.  I can't wait ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playstation 3 and Blu-ray ramblings" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playstation-3-and-blu-ray-ramblings">Playstation 3 and Blu-ray ramblings</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Yesterday, Sony held a little press conference and called it Destination Playstation.  At this press event, Sony announced a bunch of information that I've been waiting for.  They announced the release date for <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b> and announced a bundle pack that includes Metal Gear Solid 4, an 80gb Playstation 3, and a Dual Shock 3.  All of this will hit shelves on June 12th, 2008 for a very reasonable price of $500.  For $500, I'll get the game I want, a Playstation 3 that'll play nearly all Playstation games and has decent harddrive space, and their "new" controller.  I don't even have to bother with owning a Sixaxis controller, I can skip right to the new controller.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" /></p><p>I'm pretty happy about this bundle.  SO happy, in fact, that I've begun taking an active look at what games I really want for the Playstation 3 and what Blu-ray movies I should by.</p><p>and thus...  rambling begins.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>Game-wise, there isn't a megaton of wealth out there, but there's a few things I'm interested in.  Two games that are already out are Uncharted and Stranglehold.</p><p><b>Uncharted</b> has been described as the perfect action movie come into the game scene.  The game takes a lot of cues from Die Hard, where you control a "regular" guy in extreme action situations.  I don't know all the details, but it sounds pretty fun.  Not $60 fun, of course.  I would definitely pick it up for $30, or perhaps stretch it to $35.  Used copies are floating around the $40~$45 mark.  That should go down by summer.</p><p><b>Stranglehold</b> is another "action movie" game.  Directed by John Woo and "starring" Chow Yun Fat, Stranglehold is the sequel to their first collaboration, Hard-boiled.  I've played the demo on Xbox and it is one of the most ridiculous games to come out last year.  I love it.  Not $60 love it, though.  This is another 30 spot, at best.  I wanted the PS3 collector's edition because it included the original Hard-boiled on Blu-ray, but now..  I don't really care.  I don't really care to watch Hard-boiled, and the game was developed for the Xbox.  I think I'll probably just pickup the 360 version when I find it for $20 or less.</p><p>Another game I want to pick up in <b>Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</b>, which is already out in Japan and April here in the US.  Though, paying $50 for a mere fraction of what will be Gran Turismo 5 is way too much.  It's the equivalent of a demo, really.  $50 for a demo is ridiculous, but it's really a showcase for the Playstation 3.  It shows off how good the graphics can be.  Maybe If I find a super cheap copy in Japan, I'll pick it up.  Like, $35 cheap..  :shrugs:, maybe not.</p><p>And that's it really.  There's not even anything else in development I'm terribly interesting in except for <b>Resident Evil 5</b>.  <b>Wipeout HD</b> is also kinda iffy..  that series really died for me after Designer Republic broke off from Psygnosis/Liverpool.</p><div class='title'><b>Movies</b></div><p>Something I did do immediately in celebration was purchase <b>Scanner Darkly</b> on Blu-ray for $20.  Hurrah, my first Blu-ray.  I started to take a look at what other movies I would want as well, but that momentum began to fizzle off.</p><p>Netflix is really helpful in keeping you from buying movies.  With every movie I came across, I thought to myself, "Am I really going to watch this more than once?"  I Love Scanner Darkly and would watch it a couple times over.  It's also that kind of movie that I would want to watch with people when they're around.  But other movies like that?</p><p><b>War of the Worlds</b> is another movie I was thinking of.  I would definitely love to see that in beautiful Hi-Definition, but all the other movies I came up with I already own or it wouldn't make a difference if I owned them on Blu-ray v. DVD.  Even Scanner Darkly is somewhat useless on Blu-ray because it's animated.  War of the Worlds isn't out of Blu-ray though..</p><p>There are some movies that are out on Blu-ray that caught my eye.  Like <b>Blade Runner</b>, <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, and <b>Fifth Element</b>.  Each of these movies have been "remastered" for Blu-ray and weren't originally filmed with HD in mind.  How good could these movies really look compared to DVD.  Plus, how many times would I really watch them?  Wings of Honneamise would be spectacular except they don't even sell a stand-alone Blu-ray.  It comes with a DVD version and is $80?!</p><p>One movie I came across that could be amazing on Blu-ray is <b>Paprika</b>.  That movie was brilliantly gorgeous, but I didn't really like it.  The movie was all about the visuals and effects.  Purchasing it reminds me a lot of purchasing Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 on DVD back in the day.  I love those movies and thought it was a brilliant display of music and animation.. but now they just sit on the shelf.. taking up space.  Is that how Paprika will be in a year if I buy it?</p><p><b>Lost season 3</b> is out on Blu-ray..  but I already own the DVDs and I haven't even watched them yet!  Plus those Blu-rays are expensive..  screw that.</p><p>All-in-all, my little Blu-ray mania ended pretty quickly.  I have Scanner Darkly, will pick up War of the Worlds, and might buy Paprika.  I still have until mid-June anyways, so there's no rush on Paprika.  Also, I'll pick up <b>Cloverfield </b>on Blu-ray.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Even with owning a Playstation 3 in the future, it doesn't really seem worth it.  I'll play through Metal Gear, and then Uncharted.  But then it'll probably just sit there...  much like my PSP.  My Wii is the same way too.  I haven't touched my Wii since November.</p><p>Hopefully, owning a PS3 will revitalize my Playstation spirit and I'll finally start digging into my backlog of Playstation 2 games sitting on my shelf.  We'll see.</p><p>Also, HD isn't going to matter at all until I buy an HD TV.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Apollo Justice impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/apollo-justice-impressions">Apollo Justice impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Apollo Justice is the fourth game in the Phoenix Wright / Ace Attorney / Gyakuten Saiban series by Capcom and takes the series in a new direction for a couple different angles.</p><p>First off, It's the first game in the series to be specifically developed for the DS from the ground up.  All the other PW games were simply ports from the Gameboy Advance.  The first game did have a DS only chapter at the end, which is really just a taste of what the could do with the series.  In Apollo Justice, the sprites are higher resolution, more detailed, and better colored, cut-scenes are now pre-compiled, rather than using sprite manipulation, and everything else you saw in Chapter 5 of Phoenix Wright 1.</p><p>The other huge change for the series is Apollo Justice as the main character.  Apollo Justice, the game, takes place at least 7 years after the end of Phoenix Wright 3, and you begin by defending Phoenix Wright whose been accused of murder.  Through defending him you become aware of your own power as an attorney, much like Phoenix did back in the day.  You overcome people's lies through 'perceiving the truth' by a tell or nervous twitch, rather than 'unlocking it' by seeing their Psyche-Locks.</p><p>Apollo Justice as the main lead is as huge a risk for the series as it is a change and is the largest criticism about the game.  I mean, the previous were named Phoenix Wright (in the US).  He is the game.  Games like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Halo 2 suffered greatly because of this criticism when you played as Raiden or the Arbiter.</p><p>Being a huge fan of Phoenix Wright, I wasn't really bothered by this.  One of my favorite moments in past Phoenix Wright games was playing as a different character and learning about Phoenix Wright from a different angle.  I cared about the Phoenix Wright universe and cast of characters as a whole that seeing it through the eyes of someone was a refreshing change of pace and offered a slew of new jokes and memes.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, my only complaint about playing as Apollo Justice is that he's almost too much like Phoenix Wright in the beginning.  Though truly, if Phoenix Wright or any other previous character wasn't in this first case, it would have turned me off from the concept.  Phoenix Wright is the crucial immediate tie-in back to the series as a whole and is crucial in shaping Apollo Justice, the character, in becoming the next big thing.</p><p>In Apollo Justice, what I'm most interested in are the tie-ins back to the series as a whole and the future of the series.  When does this take place?  Why should I care about Apollo Justice?  Has this series jumped the shark?  Thankfully that first question was somewhat answered in the first 2 hours of the game.  Something has happened to Phoenix Wright 7 years ago that screwed up his lawyerin' career, and I'm sure that through the course of the game it will be revealed.</p><p>As for jumping the shark, there were several moments in Phoenix Wright 2 and 3 I felt that the series was stale.  The first couple cases felt like more of the same.  Phoenix Wright 2 is the biggest offender.  But, each game ended in a very satisfying way, and Phoenix Wright 3's ending pulled everything together.  It pulled together all the cases in the game, and all the characters and events from previous games.  I would probably not be as excited for Apollo Justice had Phoenix Wright 3 not ended so greatly.</p><p>And here I am now.  Apollo Justice continues with the same enthusiasm and hilariousness the makes the series great.  The first case is a great example of what makes these game fun to play. ^_^  I think this 'restart' of Phoenix Wright will keep fans of the first 3 games happy, as well as, present a good starting point for new people to join the series without playing the previous games (though I haven't played it enough to 100% stand by that assumption).</p><p>I'll let you know as time goes on ^_^.  If you haven't played any Phoenix Wright games, definitely pick up the first one and check it out.</p><p>Also, you can check out a mocked-up demo version of Apollo Justice on Flash here: <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x" title="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x" title="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x">http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x</a></p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>Now that I'm playing Apollo Justice on the bus, I've stopped playing Brain Age 2 Sudoku for the time being.  I made it pretty far though with 91% completion.  Only 12 or 13 puzzles left to complete.  This is pretty close to make completion of Brain Age 1 Sudoku of 87%.  The Sudoku puzzles in the second game I found to be more challenging and interesting, rather than the first game where the difficult puzzles were just annoying.  The pacing of difficultly as the puzzles went on in Brain Age 2 was very subtle and really pushed you to use different techniques of counting from 1 to 9.  In Brain Age 1, it felt all over the place..</p><p>Though, maybe I've just grown as a Sudoku puzzler.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Barack Obama in Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/barack-obama-in-madison">Barack Obama in Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

We're probably past a total of 80 inches total for the year AND there's more to come on Thursday and Saturday.  Because of the snowfall, my fancy plans to travel to Minneapolis with Tony and attend the Cinematic Titanic launch party had failed.  Driving conditions were poor, so Madison we stayed.</p><p>Luckily, there was another high profile event happening in our very city.  Democratic Nominee, Barack Obama had a rally downtown at the Kohl Center.  An excellent Plan B to follow through.  So that's what we did. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting In</b></div><p>Obama's speech was set for 8pm, with the doors opening at 6:15pm.  I got there around 5:45pm and caught up to Tony without a problem.  But the crowds were massive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" /></p><p>It's kinda tough to see, but the wonderful people that organized the event decided to funnel the massive crowd of thousands into a single entrance way.  BRILLIANT!  By the time we arrived and the time we decided to screw the line we were in, we moved about 40 feet?  I think.. about a foot a minute.</p><p>Eventually they opened up other entrances, and we eventually positioned ourselves to a point where we could get inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" /></p><p>We entered the premises around 7:15pm..  7:30pm.  And, since we took forever to get inside, nearly every single seat in the building was taken.  After stooping around, we found some seats above the exit way that were covered up for unknown reasons.  Unknown enough for us, and another group, to pull the tarp off the seats and uncover the perfect spot to sit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" /></p><p>We had a nice little perch, and eventually the arena became more and more full.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Speech</b></div><p>The speech had several lead-ins, starting with the student organizer and the campus organizer.  Eventually, Governor Doyle took the stage to pronounce his support for Barack Obama.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" /></p><p>With the conclusion of his speech, Governor Doyle introduced "the next president of the United States", Barack Obama to uproarious applause and cheering.  It was a thunderous pounding roar that was really captivating and emotional.</p><p>On stage, Obama gave his speech about how he will bring about change and fix our broken country.  How the politics of the last 'decade' have screwed us and what we stand for.  I'm not a huge follower of Obama, but I can imagine it's quite similar to his other speeches.  He didn't really focus on health care or working class as much as the Bush Administration and the failed politics in Washington.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" /></p><p>It was incredibly powerful.  When you hear him on TV, you get a sense of how powerful his voice and his message are, but to hear them directly, with the same man in the same room amplifies the message and really hits you.  It's the same effect as listening to music on headphones or speakers versus going to a real club and feeling the pounding bass in your heart and being soaked with sound.</p><p>If I had one word to describe the evening, it would be "powerful."  Can't stop the signal.  Can't stop the message.  Hopefully, he will bring about change and fix everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, as the speech concluded, he closed on the same powerful note he kept reiterating.  "We will bring about change, and YES we can make it happen," and as he ended Tony and I got the crap outta there to beat the crowds.</p><p>All toll, the Kohl Center was packed beyond capacity.  Every single seat was filled.  All the aisles clogged.  The floor jam packed with as many people as possible.  And there was even an overflow room outside of the arena packed with people, who were treated to a speech prior to his actual message.</p><p>The papers and press tomorrow will probably have the exact count of attendees, which should be an interesting statistic.</p><p>Speaking of press, there were plenty of satelite linked vans outside as we exited.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" /></p><p>beep beep beep beep..  Can't stop the signal.</p><p>It's unfortunate, that Tony and I missed the Cinematic Titanic launch party, but I almost think this was a much better spent evening.  Hopefully, Joel and the rest of the gang will have a Wisconsin tour in the future.</p><p>Also, if you look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp">third-from-the-last</a> image above, you can see Waldo in the lower-left hand corner.
