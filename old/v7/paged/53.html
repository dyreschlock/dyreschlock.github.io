| July 7, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Man, it can really storm in Florida when it wants to.  It just so happens that July is the pinnacle months for heavy thunderstorms.  The heavy weather is brushed from the Atlantic and flows directly over the state and back out over the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>It was really clear on July 4th, but these last few days have been graced with lightning, thunder, and torrential rains.  With Tampa Bay to our east, you can see the rains coming from miles away before it's finally on top of you.  Off in the distance, the clouds will flash and growl.  A few minutes later, streaks of lightning appear parallel to the several skyscrapers on Tampa in the distance.  A few minutes later, part of the horizon disappears with a mess of gray.  The rain literally pulls the cloud into the water.  A few minutes later, the gray blob engulfs more of the horizon and lightning fires out of the clouds into the blob, up and around the blob.  The white light dances horizontally through the sky before finding a spot to land.</p><p>Several minutes have passed and the view of the east-side is completely obstructed, but it's still really light on this side.  On our side, the sky's mostly overcast with patches of sun shining through.  There's a clear division of light and dark ripping through the sky almost right above our heads.</p><p>About half an hour later the storm finally hits us and that blurry gray mess blending sky and ground shows itself to us first hand.  The rain is relentless, pounding and soaking the ground.  The excess rain floods the highways, the streets, everything.  Rain everywhere.</p><p>This really isn't anything all that new to us in the Midwest though.  We already had these types of storms throughout the month of June that completely ripped through farmlands, streets, cities and anything.</p><p>We were driving around in this storm and got back last night.  It let up quite a bit at that time, so I decided to walk around in the rain.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1453.webp" /></p><p>The streets and sidewalks had already been super-heated from the sun earlier in the day, so the water was very warm.  Walking around barefoot in the large puddles surrounding both sides of the street, felt like walking in a pool or a man-made lake.  I guess the rain was heated from the sun beating down on the tops of the clouds.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1458.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1458.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1458.webp" /></p><p>The beach was equally warm.  Tip-toeing across the warm rocks, unto the rough warm sand, walking into the smooth warm muddy sand in the warm waters..  The only thing cold about this rain was the walking through the grass to get to the beach.  The rain itself wasn't really all that cold either.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1476.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1476.webp" /></p><p>Well, I guess the other cold about the rain was getting back inside the house to the frigid air conditioning.</p><p>The next day, today, the sun pierced the sky and made quick work of any evidence left by the rain.  Only to have the rains bring heaven to earth again a couple hours later.  So, now I'm waiting in the airport for my flight which is still on time, admit several other flights which have been canceled or delayed until tomorrow.  Lucky!</p><p>Anywho, Tampa is pretty rad.  I also made Justin take me to the Green Iguana Saturday Night for Richard Vision and Ybor City during Sunday afternoon for sight seeing.  These two events probably should've happened in reverse order since I found out that Ybor City is the heart of Tampa's nightlife.  I bought a pretty slick record at the DJ shop. ^_^  Here's the Czar Vodka Bar which will definitely bring me back here before the end of the year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1433.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1433.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Justin isn't much of a bar-hopin', dance goin' fella, but that's understandable since the last 10 years have been akin to chaos living in the Army, shipping to Iraq twice, and two kids that constantly demand attention.  Not too mention, they're still in the process of unpacking their belongings in their new home.  A welcome couple hours of peace online or on xbox is his idea of vacation.</p><p>Whereas my life at the moment is fairly boring, calm and void of chaos.  Especially now that I don't have to live with Dave and Gage's band practicing a night or two a week.  My home is a calm center that tears down stress of work.  A peaceful grove to watch TV shows, play games, occasionally read and casually work on errata.  Ughh..  that sounds WAY too "Men are Mars, etc" for me to bear, but it's true.</p><p>Anywho, Heading out to bars and clubs is a welcome surge of energy to break up the stillness.  Though, it's mainly because of the music and the beer.  Speaking of Beer, I have found the most delicious Floridian beer during my 4-day stay here at Tampa:  Land Shark Lager.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1479.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1479.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1479.webp" /></p><p>It's very smooth like Corona, but has a tasty crispness that doesn't make it taste like Crap/Corona.  I drank a ton of the stuff.  It would probably taste even more amazing with a slice of lime or lemon, but it doesn't need it.</p><p>...And to get back to the original conversation, here's a couple other notable places found in Ybor city.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1435.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1435.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1436.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1436.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1438.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1438.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1438.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1447.webp" /></p><p>That last shot was taken facing west about an hour before it rained and the chronological beginning of this post.</p><p><em><b>Post-Flight Update</b></em>:  Well, I must've jinxed that whole "on-time" remark as my plane came in nearly 2 hours later than I had hoped.  But, I arrived back in Madison in one day and nearly finished my book, so I can't complain ^_^.  Also, It's raining a bit here at the moment, so it seems I've traded one storm for another.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Thinking about Florida" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/thinking-about-florida">Thinking about Florida</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 5, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm in a different world down here.  Not one radically different than the world of Wisconsin, but a much different climate which has altered the thoughts and practices behind the development of the Floridian society.  Houses built for heat rather than cold.  Flamingos and White Cranes stalk the beaches, rather than black birds eying grassy plains.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1363.webp" /></p><p>Cheese doesn't really exist down here, which makes me sad..  but my disappointment is immediately expunged at their abundance of crab, salmon, and other delicious seafood.  The heated climate also gives birth to a beautiful variety of fruits, some strange, some familiar.  I don't need String Cheese for a snack, when I can pick up a Mango or quickly fry up some super-cheap salmon fillet.  Also, I think if you're going to eat mangos raw, use a knife rather than sinking your teeth into it.  Maybe mine was not ripe, but it was much tougher than I thought.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1359.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1359.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1359.webp" /></p><p>Most of you know this, but I came down to Florida to visit my friend in the military, Justin.  With my 10-year High School Reunion only 2 weeks away, It has really been 10 years since he decided to join the service out of high school and has been jumping back and forth between different trainings and posts.  Along the way, he started a family and has 2 kids, Alex (3) and Eric (1).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1351.webp" /></p><p>Little children are an interesting specimen.  No matter how righteous or enlightened you think you are, you were once this frail little person that does absolutely nothing with their time.  I'm a strong believer that environment is the key resource to how a child is shaped into the adult they become and the environment is larger what you put into it because they learn by watching you.  The bigger influence you are in their lives, whether it be interaction, your environment, or your decisions, the more they'll become you later in their life.  Eh, but what do I know on the subject anyways, right?</p><p>Anywho, Florida is like an oven.  During the day, the heat lamps are turned on and bake all the houses and roads and trees.  It fills the earth with hot energy.  But the people of Florida do everything to rid themselves of the heat.  You walk around outside in 80, 85 degree heat, and enter a 65, 70 degree freezer every place you go.  The chillness is an instant break from the humidity, but after a while you need a break from the cold.  I think that's just expectations, though.  I expect to be dying from the heat, but instead, I'm freezing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1360.webp" /></p><p>The Floridian night has been my favorite part of the day because the heat lamps turn off and the humidity fails.  The ground is still retains the heat from the course of the day, so your bare feet are never too cold.  The air is still warm, but holds a soft breeze.  It's not a chilling breeze or a cool breeze..  just ventilation really.  Movement.</p><p>The sand of the Tampa beach is soft and fine.  Walking along the receded shoreline feels more like tracking through mud than the beaches you'd find in the Midwest.  I guess that's the difference of the sea's massive unrelenting waves savaging Florida, rather than the relative stillness of lakes.  It's very soothing between my toes, which completes the entire scene on the beach here.</p><p>The vacant beach.  The oozing sand massages my feet.  The gentle warm breeze tickles the hairs on arm.  The soft constant waves brush against my shins.  And surrounded by a theater of fireworks in the distance.  The pop, pop, pop and the brilliant flashes sparking and twinkling.  It looks like a thin strip of Christmas lights along the horizon of the beaches across Tampa Bay with the few skyscrapers also lit up.  Serenity graced with a stripe of chaos.</p><p>Romance comes to mind.  Sharing this calm moment with a significant other.  I wasn't alone though as Justin had been following me, and we'd been talking about our lives and what we thought of our positions in life.  Where to go, what to do...  Those type of questions.</p><p>Anywho, today is another day in the oven state and walking around on the sloppy beach sounds like a good idea, I might wait until sun fall though so it's not other cooler, but holding a couple beers doesn't set off any warning bells of public intoxication.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playstation's Trophy System" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playstations-trophy-system">Playstation's Trophy System</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On the surface, the trophy system sounded like a good alternative to the Achievement System the Xbox 360 has from launch.  I kinda figured it would work a lot like Steam achievements.</p><p>With Steam, every achievement is valued the same.  For each game you have a percentage complete and that's how you compare achievements with your pals.  There is a lack of quality though, as this is really only a comparison of how much you've played the game versus your friends.</p><p>With Xbox Live Achievements, every single achievement has a specific value.  Even though Microsoft regulates that each game cannot exceed 1000 points (except through DLC), it's up to the developer to distribute those points in the game.  They can choose how many achievements and the value of each one.  Percentage Complete does not matter.</p><p>In a way, that's kinda neat.  For example: Of the 1000 points, you could have 2 really difficult achievements worth 300 each, and 5 dirt-ass easy achievements for 80 each.  One gamer could've gotten the 2 tough achievements for a gamer score of 600, while another gamer could've gotten those easy ones for a total of 400.  In this case, you can clearly tell who the "better" gamer is because of the score.  The Percentage complete wouldn't reflect this at all..</p><p>Though, the "better" gamer could easily scoop up those other 5 achievements, the criteria for those achievements could be something unrealistic for the "better" gamer to achieve.  Like "Complete the game on Easy" or whatever..  The "better" gamer probably has better thing to do with their time..  Especially when playing another game gets just as many points as this one.</p><p>Xbox focuses on the quality of achievements you receive rather than quantity, but, in many ways, quantity is its own form of quality as playing many many many games will get you a rather high gamer score.</p><p>The Playstation's Trophy System takes an alternative route to both implemenations, but still borrows ideas from each..  In game, you have 3 different weighted trophies to obtain: Gold, Silver and Bronze.  Silver carries more weight than Bronze, and so forth..  There's also a Platinum trophy for each game which is awarded when you complete 100% of the achievements in a game.</p><p>Each game has a specific amount of trophies they can distribute, but they didn't really say how they are distributed..  Does that mean each game has 6 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze?  or does it work like the Xbox and you can have any amount of trophies you want as long as they add up to a specified amount?  :shrugs:...  Either way, all these trophies do add up.  Each one gives you a little bit of "experience" which will gain you "Gamer Levels", which is the global way of comparing yourself to others.</p><p>This whole system seems like a refinement of the achievement system that pulls together both quantity and quality.  I'm a big fan of those Platinum Trophies because the system actually rewards you for playing through the entire game and doing everything.  Although, there are games on Steam and Xbox that give you rewards in game for 100% completion, neither service does on a global level.</p><p>The big problem I see with the Playstation Trophies is support.  At launch of the 2.40 firmware update, only 9 games will support Trophies, all of which are first party.  The free game that came with the Metal Gear Solid 4 Playstation 3 Bundle is on that list (PAIN), but there's no announcement of Metal Gear Solid 4 Trophies, which is what I want.  Also no Trophies for Flow, Echochrome, or Everyday Shooter :/  Trophy Support can be patched into any game, though.. so hopefully these developers will work on that.</p><p>Anywho, this information comes from the Playstation blog where Eric Lempel gives a video demostration of the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/29/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-1-the-xmb/" title="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/29/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-1-the-xmb/">In-Game XMB</a> and the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/30/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-2-trophies/" title="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/30/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-2-trophies/">Trophy System</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Infected Mushroom, Jimmie Page @ Visions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago">Infected Mushroom, Jimmie Page @ Visions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 22, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, Tony, Erika and I made a little trip down to Chicago.  Earlier in the week when getting caught up on "the scene" in Minneapolis, I broadened my search to see what was coming up in Chicago and noticed that Infected Mushroom was down there this weekend.  The one thing I had planned this weekend was canceled, so I thought, "why the hell not?"  I figured that Tony and Erika would want to come with so I invited them along ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Chinatown</b></div><p>One place I've heard about in Chicago is Chinatown.  Erika always mentions Chinatown when the subject of Chicago crops up in conversation.  So we figured that would be an ideal location to visit.  First, we got something to eat since we really hadn't had anything all day and then we took a look around at the area and the shops.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" /></p><p>Chinatown was spread out much more than I thought It was going to be.  I was thinking it would've been cramped together like the one in Nagasaki, or the type of thing you'd see in a Hong Kong action movie.  Thing alley-ways with tons of shops.  There were tons of shops, but it felt like an actual town, rather than a closet.  I guess that's just the American environment at work...  When they first laid the groundwork for Chinatown, they had the room to spread out.  They were confined to a single square block.</p><p>They have some sort of festival coming up on Sunday July 20th sponsored by McDonalds that looks like it'd be fun.  Unfortunately, I'll be in Minneapolis that weekend for my High School Reunion, so that's out.  Maybe next year.</p><p>It'd definitely be neat to check out the other international areas of Chicago in the future.  Erika mentioned a Greek Town and Korea Town..  maybe there's a little Italy in there somewhere.  The one is probably full of mobsters, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Downtown</b></div><p>Afterwards, we hopped back on the trains and went downtown and killed a couple hours walking around and looking for stores that no longer exist.  We came across the still under construction Trump tower that you might know from the first season of the Apprentice.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" /></p><p>They still have a ways to go before they claim the title of tallest building in Chicago, though.  We hung out around the river for quite a while as day turned to dusk turned to night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" /></p><p>We hung out at the two-story museum-like McDonalds for another hour until the doors finally opened up at Visions.</p><div class='title'><b>Visions</b></div><p>It had been a while since the last time I was at Visions.  Actually, I'm not even totally sure when the last time was...  Lemme see..  ah, it was Sasha in 2004.  Luckily, I have all this crap <a href="/old/v7/club" title="/club">written down</a>, back when I really cared about it ^_^  2004 was aksi when I started going to fewer clubs...</p><p>Anyways, there was actually a decent line forming in the front of Visions.  People were pretty excited for Infected Mushroom ^_^  It wasn't too long before we got in, but they kept everyone waiting in that extra club that you usually go right through into Visions.  Nope, they had the door shut and a guy posted at the entrance to keep people from actually getting into Visions.  So all of us the fanboy crowd sat in there while we could clearly see others in Visions...</p><p>Oh well, at 11pm the dude opened up the doors and we all piled into Visions.</p><div class='title'><b>Jimmie Page</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" /></p><p>Jimmie Page greeted us into Visions with some fantastic tracks and kept them coming all night long.  The pounding beats built into a mass hysteria of funk and house.  I think I bought a CD of his a couple years ago and it sounded nothing like this.  Honestly, I need to hold reservations on people until I hear them live.  I think that's the true test of quality and ambiance.  Can the performer really resonate with the crowd and build up the set keeping the audience in suspense while still giving them exactly what the want?</p><p>Jimmie Page proved he was that man, and he really blew me away.  I got a demo CD from him too, so I can't wait to listen to that later on. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" /></p><p>Though, the crowd began to slip away from Jimmie with the anticipation of Infected Mushroom and their vacant equipment sitting on the stage opposite of the DJ booth.  Thankfully the fans weren't too rude by chanting "Infected Mushroom" or anything, but they were definitely there for the Mushroom.</p><div class='title'><b>Infected Mushroom</b></div><p>After a 2 1/2 hour set, Jimmie relinquished aural command and all eyes set themselves on the stage where Infected Mushroom was set to go.  The fans went nuts. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" /><br/>I've heard of Infected Mushroom, but never actually heard them previous to this night.  The name made me immediately think of PsyTrance on the order of Hallucinogen and such groups, but I was dead wrong with that classification.  I'm not really sure what sub-sub-genre of Electronica they'd fall into, but they'd definitely be right next to Prodigy on the shelf.  Tony was thinking Hardcore, or, at least, somewhere in that area, which sounds about right.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" /></p><p>Infected Mushroom were fucking incredible, though..  I think they're my new favorite band, ^_^.  For over an hour and a half they keep playing song after song after song and didn't quit.  Bam Bam Bam Bam, like the thunderous body-pounding bass surging into your chest with every beat.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" /></p><p>I don't think I've ever seen a crowd this energetic for anyone.  Most of the DJs or bands I see are mostly low key or if they have a pounding beat are still strung together with a melodic ambiance that is still calming.  Infected Mushroom is constant barrage.  Bam Bam Bam Bam, punching you in the face, in the shoulder.. pushing you around.  Their music has this surge of adrenaline that keeps you moving fist pumping in the air and yelling as loud as you can.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" /></p><p>The night was quite amazing and I'm glad I asked Tony and Erika to come alone with. ^_^  This is the type of thing where'd I usually run off alone and not ask anyone to join me, but I figured they'd be interested in checking it out, at the very least.</p><p>More Pictures can be found here: <a href="/old/v7/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago" title="/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago">http://www.theschlock.com/photo/080622_chicago/</a></p><div class='title'><b>The drive home</b></div><p>Bar curfews very from city to city.  Minneapolis has a curfew that all bars and clubs must close by 3am on a Saturday night.  I think, Madison is 2am..  But Chicago can go all the way to 5am.  Fortunately, Infected Mushroom finished off their encore around 3am, so we didn't stay all that late in the windy city.  I think we got out of downtown and back on the highways around 3:45am or 4am.</p><p>That drive home is always difficult for me because I've just come from this immense loud ear-damaging party, and now must drive for quite a while until I'm finally able to sleep.  I've never made it all the way before..  Usually, I find some motel and sleep in the parking lot for a few hours to muster the energy to finish the trip later or stop off at one of those Oasis McDonalds and buy enough food to keep me busy.  I almost made it to Rockford this time ^_^.  Erika offered to drive the rest of the way to Freeport and Tony drove the rest of the way back to Madison.  We got to watch the sunrise as we trotted along the highways.</p><p>Anywho, today I'm so completely sore.  I feel like I was thoroughly beaten up.  It was really more of love beating, though.  It'll be tough to top last night with the several events that are coming up in the next few months, but they're spread out enough that shouldn't ruin them.  Hopefully I can find something decent in Tampa for the July 4th weekend....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's heavy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-heavy">It's heavy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning I woke up around 4:30 in the morning.  It was the first time I had ever woken up to my alarm and not gone back to bed immediately.  It wasn't too difficult since I went to bed around 9:45 the night before.  I got out of my bed closet and went into the bathroom, dragging some clothes with.  I took a shower and washed the night away to make a clean break for the day ahead.</p><p>I left my new apartment around 5 o'clock, while it was still fairly dark out.  It's been a while since I've seen a sunrise, but with the cloud cover vast and dark, it would still be a while longer.  I got into the car that I'm borrowing and went to my local Wal*mart.</p><p>Wal*mart didn't open until 6, but since they were only getting 6 Metal Gear Solid 4 Playstation 3 Bundles, I figured that I would have to wait outside before anyone else arrived in order to procure one.  I had this planned out all week for today's release.</p><p>On my drive, I nervously thought to myself if another 6 people were already waiting at the door, perched to snatch the few precious copies.  I had the rest of the morning planned out if such an event occurred for the other 24 hour Wal*mart said that if their night crew hadn't put their copies out throughout the night, the morning crew, which started at 7, would surely do so.  I had my suspicions, though. If not, there was still Shopko at 8, Best Buy at 9, and Toys R Us at 10.<br/>I turned onto Gammon and as I neared the beltline, Wal*mart was in clear view from across the highway.  All the street lamps illuminated the area like a massive spotlight in the grim dark of morning.  It went out of view when I continued underneath the bridge.  The tree line hide the shopping center on the other side.</p><p>I turned the corner and then turned into parking lot which joined both Wal*mart and Sam's Club.  Several cars were grazing in the parking lot.  Most of them keeping to themselves, but there were a few grouped together near the entrance.  I couldn't make out any figures from my current distance, but as I neared, there were definitely a couple people outside.  The group finally came into focus and a mere 4 figures emerged.  Yes!  Call me Number 5.</p><p>I park my car, went outside and approached the line just as the clock hit 5:15.  In the line stood 2 couples, so I was actually Number 3.  We talked about Metal Gear, and other games to purchase.  As the minutes trickled by, another person joined us and the conversation.  Then another..  and eventually another.</p><p>Number 6 joined the line around 5:45, so I could've waited a little longer before getting to Wal*mart, but I'm fine with my position in line.  3 other groups of people were too late.</p><p>At 6 o'clock the doors opened and inside we went.  Unfortunately, the staff were confused as to why we were there, and even more confused when trying to ring us up at the register.  This whole free $100 gift card w/ purchase of Blu-ray player this week wasn't trained to the entire staff.  It took the 6 of us a couple minutes to go through the check-out lines, but by 6:30 I was out of Wal*mart with both Giftcard and PS3 in hand.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" /></p><p>huzzah!</p><p>After you purchase a Playstation 3 and lift the box, I think everyone's puzzled expression is the same, "It's heavy".  The thing weighs 16 lbs according to my bathroom scale.  It's a heavy-duty piece of equipment.</p><p>Anywho, now it's about 7 o'clock and it's almost time to go to work..... LONGEST WORK DAY EVER! At least, now when I go to Wal*mart for lunch I won't need to pay for the next month or two.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Furniture Store employees are stalkers" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/furniture-store-employees-are-a-bunch-of-stalkers">Furniture Store employees are stalkers</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 2, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past week, I bought two new pieces of a furniture while shopping around for some household supplies. First, I bought a very nice end table from American TV in their clearance section. It matches my desk quite nicely and can house food and drinks, which previously took up real estate on my desk. A couple days later, I went to East-side Slumberland and bought a decent coffee table for super cheap from their clearance section. I thought it would look great on the other side of the my desk than my end table and could house my record player, which previously sat atop my foot locker.</p><p>My home work space is starting to feel quite spacious. ^_^</p><p>I haven't been living in my new place for long, and have really only given my new address to Netflix, and the post office; however, over the weekend, I got a very peculiar piece of mail at my new address. I got a small manilla-like colored envelope from Mr. Rob Leibfried whom has very bad handwriting. It was personally addressed to myself, living at my new address. "What in the hell is this?!" I inquired to those within earshot. I was somewhat creeped out..</p><p>Those feelings began to elevate as I opened the letter to find a "Thank You" card. Inside the Thank You note said, with horrible handwriting, "Thank you for your recent purchase, rob". I began to cycle through my memory the things I had purchased with this address in mind. The only place was Slumberland, since I didn't give my new address to American.</p><p>You'd think a little context would have been helpful since the guy I bought it from was completely rude. Kyle and I discussed this a little bit, and came to the conclusion that maybe the dude felt bad about it, or something like that. I still think it's incredibly bizarre.. I spent a whopping $40 on that coffee table, and its not even all that sturdy. Even though it was crazy cheap, I still feel like I was doing them the favor... hey, I guess that's why they thanked me, huh.</p><p>Anyways, today I'm at work and my phone rings with an unidentified number. I do what I usually do: Not answer, and type the number into google to identify it for myself. By the way, if I don't have your phone number in my phone and you give me a ring, please leave a message. Otherwise, I'll probably just ignore it, if I can't figure it out through google.</p><p>This particular phone number is 608-271-1000, which is the number to American TV. "What the hell do they want? I picked up my end-table when I bought it.. I didn't sign up for anything else, despite spending 30 minutes looking at TVs," I immediately thought. Luckily, I was left a message. "Hi there Jim, this is <blank> from American TV just asking if you're enjoying your recent purchase. Let me know if you need help with anything and I look forward to seeing you soon." Jesus Christ, needy much? If I had answered, what would we even talk about? It'd be the most awkward phone call I'd ever had been a part of. Also, "see you soon"?! How soon are we talking here? Like "you're going to break into my house and stab me with a knife" soon?</p><p>It is a really good End-table though. One of the most sturdy pieces of furniture I own, next to my file cabinet. I was actually rather lucky to find it at such a spiffy price.</p><p>But anyways, do all furniture stores train their employees this way? Ikea never called me about my desk and JC Penny never called about my file cabinet. This is borderline invasion of privacy. I assumed my address was used for billing purposes, not another entry into their Rolodex. This makes me think twice about buying a TV from American or clearance couch shopping at Slumberland.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chuck Palahniuk's Snuff Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">Chuck Palahniuk's Snuff Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Almost a week now, I ran up to Minneapolis in the middle of the work day to catch Chuck Palahniuk at the Triple Rock Social Club.  This was his second stop on his two or three week tour around the US, which came just one day after his new novel, Snuff, was released to the public.  I've been to a few book signings before, but this one was a completely different experience despite, fundamentally, being the same thing.</p><p>The Triple Rock's venue is clearly a music venue.  The elevated stage overlooks a sizable dancing pit-like area with a lounge area surrounding it and there's a bar in the back to pick up drinks.  Unlike the book signings I've been to before, it was standing room only, minus a couple of tables of chairs here and there.  The place was setup as if some band was about the crash the stage and everyone would rock along and, quite honestly, that's pretty much what happened.</p><p>After Chuck signed a bunch of books at the front, the moderator of the venue got up on stage and introduced him.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" /></p><p>He greeted the crowd and laid out the events for the rest of the evening.  Chuck introduced Don Pollack to the stage and Don began to read from his book, Knockemstiff.  The vibe of the audience was quite the same of any book reading.  Everyone was quite polite and gave Don their ears.  However, the tone and content of the book sent the audience into a joyous hysteria.  The book was pretty funny, and no one held back any laughter.</p><p>Afterwards, Chuck took the stage again and began to read a short story he'd written, Loser, which he has no plans to publish.  The atmosphere erupted again with laughter, hanging off of each word Chuck spoke.  The excitement and joy of the crowd really elevated the story and brought it to life.</p><p>That atmospheric involvement worked incredibly well with Chuck's writing style.  Chuck's writing is always in first person and illustrates the characters thoughts and emotions thoroughly and comically.  I really feel like I'm inside the character's head and can understand his motives and reasons for doing what they do.  And experiencing it within the same bubble as everyone else, and being on the same page is a very collective feeling.</p><p>The variety of poeple that came to this event was far from homogeneous, yet through the brunt dark reality of Loser we're all connected.  I think it takes a certain personality to really thoroughly enjoy Chuck's writing, a dark honest side we can relate to but never live..  and it's interesting seeing all the people that probably feel the same way and how they look just like anyone you'd ever meet.</p><div class='title'><b>Aside from the readings...</b></div><p>Anyways, aside from the readings, Chuck interspersed a few games between the night's events.  The game, which we played twice, we see how fast you could inflate blow-up dolls that he through into the audience.  Winner's of the game would receive a copy of Don's book, Knockemstiff.  I have some pretty decent lungs, but the people in the front row were just a little bit quicker.</p><p>After the games, Chuck held a Q&A session, where most of the questions came from the moderator :rolls eyes:.  Thankfully, the questions weren't really all that bad.  For each little question she asked, Chuck really owned the answer and brought it back to something that was probably rehearsed.</p><p>He said that he really isn't that big a talker, but he loves to listen to people.  He listens on how they talk about others.. and how they're really talking about themselves.  When you're talking about another person, you're really describing yourself through them.  You elevate and highlight what emotions you feel when you think of them, whether it's good or bad, and paint a separate picture of them that's distinct from who they actually are.</p><p>I found this interesting because that's exactly how his recent novels are written, contrary to his early novels which were the opposite.  All of his first novels centered on a single character and you read from their point of view the entire book.  Everything was first-person and about you.  Actually, Diary was the first one that really changed this pattern where he tried to write in third-person, but from the first-person perspective of some one else.</p><p>In my opinion, Rant was his first success in writing this way.  Rant had the first-person perspective of many people focusing on the third-person view of a single character.  Snuff is laid out the same way, but I haven't read it yet to fully comment on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Free Stuff</b></div><p>He also spoke about using props within the context of the book to keep the characters centered, and always bring the reader back to a point or theme.  Themes are pretty good for describing and flushing out characters, but I think using props to enforce those themes is a little too obvious.  Like having flowers for a symbol of love..</p><p>Chuck said that Snuff has several props throughout the book, two of which were a blow-up doll and an autograph hound.  He had already thrown a bunch of blow-up dolls into the audience for the games, but he had several garbage bags full of autograph hounds he gave to the crowd as another thank you for coming. ^_^</p><p>Luckily, I'm tall, so catching all this stuff above the crowd is pretty easy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" /></p><p>Also, every participant of the reading got a pre-signed copy of the Snuff novel with a Choke bookmark.  The bookmark has a rather symbolic prop from Choke attached to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Choke</b></div><p>Speaking of Choke, we were also treated to the Trailer for the Choke movie which comes out in theaters this coming September.  Choke is Chuck's third novel, and the movie has been "in the works" for the past 8 years.  The initial movie rights were sold a year after Fight Club came out in theaters.</p><p>The Trailer is online today, and you can find it <a href="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956" title="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956">HERE</a>, at MTV's website.  It'd probably be the first movie I've ever seen where I've actually read the book FAR in advance of the movie's release.  I should probably read it again before September.<br/>____</p><p>Anywho, I had a great time ^_^ and hopefully next time I'll hear about tickets far in advance, so I can get some more of my books signed by him.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Relax" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/relax">Relax</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I can hear everything they do, what they're touching, what they're thinking.  They've infected my senses and ruined everything.  ugh.. I'm outta here.</p><p>The problem was that some part of the program was doing something it wasn't supposed to.  This particular class assumed that whoever used it, did so in a specific order.  The class didn't really give any clues about the correct order.  Apparently whoever uses this class is supposed to look into the class and study it completely first.  Ya know, really get to know who you're dealing with.  Only when you knew everything there it to know about the class, could you use it with the at-most efficiency.  Fixing the error is easy, but that doesn't solve the problem.  This class needs a little redirection on what it means to be "user-friendly".</p><p>Out of one world and into another.  The park was pretty nice, but overall a waste of time.  There are a thousand other things I could be doing rather than laying in the sun.  Stuff is backing up at work, I could probably do some of that.  I have two discs from Netflix I haven't watched either, I could probably do those both at once.  I just hooked up my PS2, though, so I could start playing some of those games.  So many things to do.</p><p>A little bit of refactoring brings the class back into society a new and better person.  The error is fixed and shouldn't return in the future.  A perfect little cog in the machine...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Grand Theft Auto IV" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/grand-theft-auto-iv">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 11, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I decided to pick up Grand Theft Auto IV today.  One of my local Shopkos had a couple Special Editions left and after thinking about how well its being received, huge future add-ons rumored, and a large chunk of my friend's list playing it...  I thought it'd be a good idea to go with the flow.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" /></p><p>Though, upon picking it up this afternoon, I noticed that all other copies of GTA IV were sold out.  Sooo.. I guess it wasn't just a shot in the dark that Shopko had some special editions left.  They weren't purchased because it's ridiculously expensive.  The Special Edition is $30 more expensive than the already expensive price of next-gen games.</p><div class='title'><b>Special Edition Swag</b></div><p>Here's what $30 buys you:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" /></p><p>There's the lock-box with two keys, a Rockstar keychain, an artbook for GTAIV, an OST sampler, a Rockstar dufflebag, and the game.  The lock-box is pretty cool and it's somewhat sturdy, but if it were locked, I could easily rip the thing open.  It's not that sturdy, unfortunately.  The artbook doesn't provide a whole lot of insight.  The dufflebag is kinda cheap, but it's not bad.  It'll work great as a travel laundry bag or a gym bag.  Also, the keychain is pretty slick.</p><p>The special edition may be expensive but comes with a bunch of things.  If that CD isn't too bad, with the keychain and dufflebag, I'd say the $30 isn't that wasteful.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>I've only played about 3 or 4 hours so far, but I needed to take a break.  The controls make me feel like it's work to do anything in the game.  I don't want to drive anywhere because I feel like I'm driving through sand the entire time, which hinders everything I do in the game.  I can't chase people because they get away too fast and can't evade cops fast enough.  I feel like I'm dragging my feet the entire time.</p><p>That's the only thing problem I have with the game, thus far.  Unfortunately, it keeps me from having tons of fun, but I'm still having fun.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Speed Racer is Amazing" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/speed-racer-is-amazing">Speed Racer is Amazing</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 10, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I went down to Freeport this weekend to see Speed Racer with Erika and Stephen and was blown away.  I think the Wachowski brother nailed the intensity of racing with the fast paced cuts and transitions of Anime and lit everything together with THE most brilliant and vibrant colors I've ever seen it a movie.</p><p>I think it's one of the few movies to actually bring live action elements into the cartoon world, rather bringing its characters into the real world.  I reminds me a lot of Dick Tracy and The Flintstones, rather than Batman or Spiderman.  The characters and their environment are completely in sync, rather than some goofy cartoon logic in our own world.</p><p>Critics seem to be pissed about this though saying the movie is sensory overload disconnected from reality.  That's exactly what it is.  What did you think it was going to be?  How is that fact a downfall?  Critics are killing this movie in the same way they did with Matrix Reloaded.  They expect one thing... and get something else.</p><p>Honestly, I think when the Wachowskis ground themselves in reality, the results are horrible.. like V for Vendetta.</p><p>Unfortunately, the critics get their way since Speed Racer flopped taking in only $20.2 million this weekend, a percentage compared to Iron Man's opening $100 million weekend and another $50 million this weekend.</p><p>I loved every minute of this minute and can't wait to see it again.  Next time, it'll be at the Imax.  If you hate the movie because its crazy, then you're too old.</p><p>Also, I'm disapointed in Mathew Fox.  He has absolutely no acting range and will always be known as Jack from Lost.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/54">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/52">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
