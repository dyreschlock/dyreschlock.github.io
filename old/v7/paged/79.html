| June 13, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>well, after a very rough and busy semester, coming back home was a bit different. so much free time. nothing to do. so i finally got plenty of time to play a bunch of video games. and a bunch of video games i have played.. most of the bad. some of them VERY good. here we go, in order of recollection:</p><p><b>Castlevania: Lament of Innocence</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Adventure</p><p>Sigh.. Konami cannot make a good 3d Castlevania. It's setup very good. the maps are designed as well as Symphony of the Night in a 3d Atmosphere. But the gameplay is so unrefined. Jumps are jadged, attacks are stoic. it's just bad.. the story seems pretty mediocre. you are trapped in a castle and dracula is taunting you. "he's playing a game".. too bad it's as bad as the actual game. the cutscenes add to the boredom with slow and drawn out dialogue. overall, not the good. <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Adventure</p><p>3D is not Castlevania's Cup of tea, but it absolutely excels at 2D. Aria of Sorrow is everything a new Castlevania game should be. It derives from the regular recipe. It takes place in 2035, 36 years after Dracula's death in 1999 (i'm not sure what storyline this follows). At this time, several people have climbed to a shrine to view a lunar eclipse. as the eclispse occurs, Dracula's castle emerges and those at the shrines are transported to the castle.</p><p>You control Soma Cruz, one of these people, who has an uncany ability to control slain monsters. anyways.. Aria of Sorrow perfectly emulates the gameplay of Symphony of the Night and adds the abilties of slain monsters. It's very good. A must own for fans of Symphony of the Night. <font color="red">5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Adventure</p><p>although, Castlevania doesn't always do 2D correctly. well, not consistantly anyways. the gravity of Circle of the Moon is very low as it seems belmont has difficulty jumping. slow on the up-sky, fast on the down-sky. it's really annoying going from Aria of Sorrow to Circle of the Moon. I'm not sure why, but controlling someone other than Belmont makes for a better game, but story-wise and gameplay-wise. the old Belmont versus Dracula is so old. it's more interesting when different. anyways.. <font color="red">1.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>XGRA extreme g racing association</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Futuristic Racing</p><p>i ended up buying this game since Extreme G3 was pretty decent afterall, even though Acclaim makes horrible games. i guess they just got lucky once with Extreme G3, unfortunately XGRA tried too hard. Career mode begins with a gigantic learning cliff. XGRA is pretty fast and intense, but you can hardly see the track. you can't turn precisely enough to make the turns and always knock yourself into walls. although, that's not to say the game is difficult. it took me 10-15 seconds to figure out R1 is the accelerate button, and i eventually caught up to other bikes and took 1st place on a 3 lap race, even with hitting the walls continuously. well it was the first race in the game. the music selection in the game is releatively poor too. way too much BT and not enough underground hits as with Extreme G3.</p><p>overall, the game was pretty disappointing, but Extreme G3 isn't perfect either. i think i should probably give the game a second chance, but i think i'll need to emerse myself in it to start liking it. at the moment <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Stella Dues</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Strategy RPG</p><p>this was the first game over the summe that i actually decided to put alot of time into (i ended up giving up this game for Castlevania Aria of Sorrow). As read in the previous thread, Stella Dues is quite a game. It features beautiful artwork and compelling gameplay, although the difficulty brings down the game. It's not the type of hard where you die all the time, it's the type of hard where you have to pay attention to everything you do during battle. Battle complexity can make regular encounters last 30-40 minutes, which is annoying. I want to progress in the story and not have to spend my time in battle all the time. Plus the sub-par voice acting begins to loose its appeal, along with the uninspired story. overall <font color="red">3 out of 5</font></p><p>the next 3 games are all developed by famed cult favorite Treasure.</p><p><b>Sin and Punishment</b> - Import Nintendo 64 - Rail Shooter</p><p>Sin and Punishment is considered one of their best games ever created, however it couldn't have been made on a worse console. I can't play this game. it's just a horrible presentation. if the revolution can play this game with crisp graphics and a controller that features naturally gameplay, i'll be able to give it a better review. but i cannot control the character with my thumb and press the Z button to fire at the same time. um.. come to think of it, i could change the controls (at least i think i can).. hrmm.. maybe i'll do that and try again. nothing can save the blurry 15 fps, though. at the moment <font color="red">2 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Stretch Panic</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Platformer</p><p>as i was sifting through games in the cheapy bin at wal*mart i found this little game. a treasure game for $15? .. sign me up. Stetch Panic is pretty interesting and quite unique. you control the character with the left stick and with the right stick, you control stretch, a shadow light hand which grabs parts of enemies and the enviroment. it's a unique concept but you need to have a game to compliment your game engine. all you do is walk around stretching and snapping enemies with no idea why your shadow can stretch things, nor what you're doing defeating these big breasts enemies. what the hell? <font color="red">1 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Astro Boy</b> - Domestic Gameboy Advance - Action</p><p>Treasure has been disappointing so far. although both the previous titles have their good attributes in other genres, Treasure excels at side-scrollers and shooters. the 2D monolith and Astro Boy is gloriously 2D. Astro Boy features a variety of different attacks you can use on your enemies like punching, kicking, and finger laser. punching is your basic attack, while kicking will topple enemies into each other. the laser will pierce enemies hitting a whole row of baddies. As you progress through the game you can power up aspects of Astro Boy to be more offensive, defensive, or aware of secrets. It's $20 well spent for your gameboy advance library. sometimes the play control of the gameboy gets a little awkward. i could probably have a better time with the game on a gameboy player <font color="red">4 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Contra Shattered Soldier</b> - Domestic Playstation 2 - Action Shooter</p><p>As mentioned in the deal thread, i picked up a copy of Contra Shattered Solider for pretty cheap. This game is fricken tough. Jesse and Zach don't lie. You have 3 lives to clear a level, during which they are thousands of way to die by accident. and overall you have 3 or 4 continues that which to beat the entire game. i have no idea how many levels there are. this game takes a bit of time to learn and master, but it's all very systematic. enemies and obstacles all appear in the same spots each time, so eventually knowledge can master Contra. but it's an intense ride. and the game has a story too. (very little of which i have been able to see, as i have only been able to beat the first level). overall <font color="red">3.5 out of 5</font></p><p>Lately i've been playing a lot of shooters. I've bought a couple and also played a couple arcade roms as well. in particular, one series that is very good is Vasara.</p><p><b>Vasara</b> - Arcade - Vertical Shooter</p><p>The story of Vasara is set in the Waring States Period of Japan as Nobunaga has begun has conquest/uniting. you take control of one of 3 characters to battle the armies of Nobunaga. stage by stage you destroy his forces and in the final showdown fight Nobunaga himself. the gameplay is quite solid, as it provides difficult and unique arrays of bullets, while having the perfect sized hit box to dodge them with. The main controls are fire and bomb. you can hold down the fire button to charge a slash attack which deflect bullets. Throughout the level, when you kill enemies your Vasara bar fills. When it's full your normal charge slash becomes a Vasara slash, which is about 3 times your nomral shot. 3 times the size, the power, and the duration. it's what you use against the boss ^_^.</p><p>On top of that, the added challenge is to kill named soliders of the war. These soldiers are usually regular enemies in yellow, mini-bosses and regular bosses. Probably names of actual samurai from the past. Each level has 20 regular samurai, plus 3 for the miniboss and boss.</p><p>overall, Vasara is quite challenging and has more to it than just shooting down everything, although that helps too. <font color="red">4 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Vasara 2</b> - Arcade - Vertical Shooter</p><p>Vasara was pretty unique and fun, and Vasara 2 actually adds to the experience with more options and added more challenging level of difficulty. you can choose normal or hard. Normal is about as challenging as the first game, whereas Hard steps it up a notch with twice as many levels, more bullets, and tougher bullets.</p><p>Vasara 2 refines the named Samurai system as well. Everything level has exactly 20 regular samurai, 4 mini-bosses and 1 boss, so you actually know what you need to kill.</p><p>Vasara 2 also expands on the Vasara system. You can now stock up to 3 Vasara, and then use the bomb button to activate them, rather than your regular charge shot. This makes normal really easy because you'll always have one ready to take out a mini-boss when you encounter one, rather than taking an entire level to charge up one and only one Vasara.</p><p>Vasara 2 is a beatiful sequel, and i play it much more than the original, even though the were released less than a year apart. I guess the developers really wanted do more with Vasara after they released the first one, and then quickly refined it ^_^. <font color="red">4.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Mars Matrix</b> - Domestic Dreamcast - Vertical Shooter</p><p>Another shooter i've gotten into is Mars Matrix by the good folks at Capcom. Mars Matrix is pretty intense. tons of enemies, tons of bullets. much like Vasara, your charge shot deflects bullets, which is extremely useful in many cases. Enemies attacks have a good variety of random and structured shots. Bosses can be predictable, but most enemies will sometimes throw you for a loop and have you dodging constantly to the point you are amazed you didn't die ^_^. i love hitboxes.</p><p>Mars Matrix has the added system of experience. everything you kill drops a golden cube and when you reach certain amounts your attack becomes more powerful. this has you running after golden cubes, while dodging bullets and shooting down enemies. you are always moving around, and always have you keep track of bullets. it's pretty intense ^_^</p><p>Near the end of the Dreamcast's short life, It was released over here in the states and was pretty hard to track down for a decent price. thank god for game crazy. overall <font color="red">4.5 out of 5</font></p><p><b>Zelda: Oracle of Seasons</b> - Domestic Gameboy Color - Adventure</p><p>After completing Castlevania, i wanted some more gmaeboy games to dive into. Zelda Minish Cap is on the list, but i don't want to pay $30 and i hadn't played Oracle yet, so i decided to spend $10 at my local gamestore and purchased the red version of the game.</p><p>It's pretty good, though still restricted when compared with A Link to the Past. Oracle of Seasons is quite linear, but it hides itself well. it takes a little bit to figure exactly what to do and where to go. It's pretty solid, but not very ground breaking. maybe if i start playing the blue version, something interesting will come out of it. <font color="red">3.5 out of 5</font></p><p>______________________</p><p>so this is where i'm at for the moment. I'm currently in level 7 of Zelda battling my way through those annoying knights. After which i'll be down 12 games so far this summer with a number of others on my plate. After Zelda i'll probably start playing Metroid Zero Mission on the gameboy, and then maybe start in with Shadow Hearts.</p><p>Though there are plenty of games i want to play too. like Metal Gear Ghost Babel for the gameboy color, Zelda Minish Cap on the gba, Mekai Kingdom coming out in about a month, In the Groove which comes out by the end of the week, Metal Slug Advance on gba, and maybe even Metroid Fusion if i like Zero Mission.</p><p>what games has everyone else been playing lately? .. any good ones? post your thoughts ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Soundbar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2">Sasha @ Soundbar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 19, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Intro / History</b></div><p>for those who don't know, Magic Knight Rayearth is an action rpg based off the popular anime series by Clamp. early in the year 1998, the saturn unleased its last batch of games: Panzer Dragoon Saga, Burning Rangers, Shining Force III, and House of the Dead.. i was working at Toys R us at the time, we got only 4 copies of each game, and after that we never got anymore saturn games at all. The saturn had died..</p><p>but towards the end of the year, after Xenosaga and Metal Gear Solid came out for the playstation, speciality gaming store like Electronic Boutique and Funcoland (at the time) received very few copies of Magic Knight Rayearth as a new release, after the saturn's death. i think i remember a few people talking about some game that came out for the saturn at EB, but Toys R us never got a copy for me to take a look at.</p><p>skip ahead 6 years to last christmas break. i found a pretty good deal on ebay for Magic Knight Rayearth, so i picked it up. Then I learned that my saturn was missing it's a/v cable, and i also lost all my saturn controllers as well.. so over the course of the previous semester i had been putting it back together, so to speak. i got a saturn controller from eau claire during no brand con, and then a found a saturn a/v cable online when surfing around.</p><p>with my saturn complete, i arrived home last week, and started to play.</p><div class='title'><b>Impressions...</b></div><p>like most Working Designs game, it's chalk full of voice acting, and anime cutscenes. It took about an hour into the game, until i was actually able to walk around and do some fighting. overall, the game is quite dissapointing.. i suppose that's why i never really heard anything about it after it first came out.</p><p>The game plays just like the old 16-bit Zelda. You have your overhead view of your characters, and then you slash at enemies to kill them. You have 3 characters that you can switch back and forth to and from at will.</p><p>There's Hikaru whose magic element is fire. even though she's kind of the leader, i think she's the weakest one of them all. her slash is generally the same as Link's slash. very close range, i usually get hit by whomever i'm trying to kill before i land an attack.</p><p>Next, there's Umi whose magic element its water/ice. She's the smart one of the group, and her attacks are more useful than hikarus. She also has a sword, but she's a fencer so she attacks forward with more range, plus she takes off more damage than hikaru.</p><p>Finally, there's Fuu. She's the calm collective bitch of the group. Her element is Wind and Healing. Her weapon is a bow and arrow, so she's best with range attacks, although they are quite weak. Her powered up shot, sends 3 homing arrows off to kill enemies. She's the most useful of the group.</p><p>After playing this game a little more and a little more, i realize just how bad it is.. I think A Link to the Past had better, more realistic sounding sound-effects than this game. Plus, when there are more than 15 or 16 sprites on the screen at once, the saturn lags. thats terrible. especially when there's a version of this game on the super nintendo that probably runs seemless.</p><p>plus i get so bored, running around doing meanille tasks, that i just can't play it for hours on end. i usually switch to tv, or go outside for a little while before coming back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So.. Overall, Magic Knight Rayearth isn't all that great. I have no idea why it is so rare, but i'm glad i didn't pay the $120 most people ask for it online. if you are a die hand Magic Knight or CLAMP fan that most see everything there is, then i suggest you rent it.. (and by rent it, i mean check out the snes rom)</p><p>Next...</p><p>i may have my saturn working, but it still doesn't save games. once i fix the memory problem, i'll start playing Panzer Dragoon Saga again, unless i get suckered into buying/playing Eternal Mana or Stella Dues.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anime Video Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anime-video-games">Anime Video Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 28, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b><u>Sword of Berserk</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>Sword of Berserk was actually my first exposure to Berserk. i remember hearing about how violent the game was, so i picked it up one day at work to check it out. (at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to La Pucelle Tactics impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/la-pucelle-tactics-impressions">La Pucelle Tactics impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 20, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As previously mentioned in others threads, there were a couple days over the christmas break where my brother and I went to just about every used video game store in Minneapolis. From that adventure, one of the titles I purchased was La Pucelle Tactics used for $25 at a gamestop, as it was the other Nippon Ichi ps2 SRPG that I had yet to play. Though, with all the work dumped on me this week, I'm not to sure how much I'll be able to play, nor if I really should. oh well, thats always how it is isn't it? ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>My own Nippon Ichi comparison</b></div><p>Nippon Ichi is really quite interesting. It is really neat how they were able to make these 3 games (La Pucelle, Disgaea, Phantom Brave) play so differently, yet still be challenging and work well.</p><p>Disgaea was extremely basic when compared to La Pucelle or Phantom Brave. It makes a good introduction to these 3 Nippon games, as it doesn't deviate too far from the most common SRPG, Final Fantasy Tactics. The gameplay is quite the same, yet it has more options that change difficulty, and other aspects of the gameplay. It also features two things that I hate. (1) A tright story which occasionally goes off on needless tangents, complete with annoying characters with minimal development. And (2) absolutely no sense of exploration and movement throughout the world. Though, fans of Disgaea easily put these two aspects aside in favor of the rock solid gameplay.</p><p>If you haven't played any of these 3 games, I suggest you begin with Disgaea because it only goes up from there. However, going from Disgaea, either Phantom Brave or La Pucelle would be fine as they both deviate from the 'tradition' SRPG gameplay style featured in Disgaea, and (at the highest level) both Phantom Brave and La Pucelle seem to be equally great.</p><p>Phantom Brave had some very interesting deviations from the 'tradition' SRPG stance. The most notable is the subtraction of the grid based movement system. Characters can move everywhere within the map, and even off the map too. Equipment was also radically changed as your weapons were now treated as characters themselves that you leveled and built. It's a system that I'd say most people didn't like about Phantom Brave as the character's stats actually became meaningless, and your most powerful person was whomever held your most powerful weapon at that time. It's something that you can try and ignore, but when taking on 2000 level bosses, you have to do it. There are also plenty of other things going on with <a href="/old/v7/phantom-brave-impressions" title="/phantom-brave-impressions">Phantom Brave</a> as well.</p><p>Though, the one thing that really got me into Phantom Brave was that my two problems with Disgaea were not an issue. Instead of a simple list of places to go, you now had a map to move about the world. And the story featured in Phantom Brave covered a wider range of emotions with the main characters who actually developed throughout the course of the game. The story kept to the point and didn't wander off for no good reason.</p><p><div class='title'><b>gametime: ~4hrs.</b></div></p><p>La Pucelle also deviates from the tradition SRPG styles by promoting a group fighting style. Movement through the map is still grid based, and you move your characters one at a time. However, when you attack or get attacked by enemies, there's a side-by-side screen that comes up showing your character(s) pulling off attacks. every character brought into this screen melee attacks the opposing side. Characters and enemies not even selected to attack can be brought into this screen and attack for you without telling them to. So, if you bring just one of your characters out in the open against 4 or 5 other enemies, you're going to get your ass kicked. You need to clump your characters together so that you can bring 3 or 4 chracters into battle, instead of just fighting alone.</p><p>The gameplay style reminds me of a cross between SNES Ogre Battle and Disgaea. In this battle screen, you have no control over your characters, but instead of just one assembled army fighting another, how you've arranged your characters on the field determine the battle participants. Long range characters are quite helpful with this. So in every battle, everybody attacks, and when you actually choose to attack an enemy, in effect, they counterattack too. You could choose to fight an enemy, and then die in that battle before even getting a chance to fight too. It makes for a very different game than Disgaea or Phantom Brave.</p><p>Special attacks are carried out differently. You select which characters or enemies you want to heal or attack, and then the attack is carried out immediately without any confrontation.</p><p>Battles also feature two other main differences: dark portals and purification. Every map has numerous dark portals randomly scattered across the field. Every once in a while, new enemies will spawn from these portals. Dark portals also have energy flowing from them in a straight line in one of the four directions. If an enemy or character is positioned on a tile the energy is flowing to, it'll get redirected depending on which way the chracter or enemy is facing.</p><p>You destroy these portals by purifying them, which any human character can do. Each character has a certain level of purification so sometimes it can take more than one turn to purify a portal. When purified, the stream of energy erupts in an attack, much like in Disgaea. All enemies in the stream are hurt. However, if you can move about the map and position characters and enemies to create a circle of energy, and then purify the portal, the circle will summon a creature and harm all enemies within the confines of the purified circle. Very powerful, yet hard to do.</p><p>Purification has another use as well. If you purify enemies, it increases the likelihood of them joining your side when they are defeated. This usually takes a lot of turns. It will change from nothing to "somewhat interested" to "thinking about converting" to "wants to convert" to "will convert no matter what." Kind of like the interest level for the dark council in Disgaea. This is how you build your army.</p><div class='title'><b>The World & The Story</b></div><p>Once again, La Pucelle doesn't have the same problem I had with Disgaea. You have a map where you move throughout the world. When you go into part of a dungeon you've already cleared, it'll show you the map and the paths you can take from that map. Dungeons can have multiple paths you can take, rather than just one way as in Disgaea and Phantom Brave. Alternate paths can reveal treasure or advance the story.</p><p>Occasionally in maps, you'll find a highlighted tile that doesn't represent a way in or out. Moving a character to this tile will lead to a cutscene that'll advance the story.</p><p>The story is split up into chapters like Disgaea and Phantom Brave, but each chapter has multiple endings, depending on what you did or didn't do during that chapter. For example, the first chapter you investigate the presence of zombies near the sewer. As you trek down the sewer, you find a castle. In one map, you can find one of those highlighted tiles, and unlock a room where two people were imprisoned and died. You learn about their past and more about the zombies and the castle. In another map, you find out more about the castle, and what is really going on, so when you eventually fight the boss, you aren't just blindly killing him. You know why you're doing it. You get monetary bonuses for Good Endings too. ^_^</p><p>As for the story, it also seems like it has more to it than Disgaea, although it follows the same formula. The characters are all part of a church, and the most powerful church of the land is cooking up something evil, and being part of this little yet faithful church. It's your job to investigate matters further. I've only completed 2 chapters so far, so I don't know all the details.</p><p>The main character of La Pucelle, Prier, is an obnoxious brat, but she still has logical qualities that doesn't make her as annoying as Laharl from Disgaea. They are brought out by the immediate supporting character, Culotte, her brother, as he usually talks about her. He describes her in a way that she would never describe herself. This provides two viewpoints of the story: the sensical side of the brother explaining the situation, and the brash comedical side of the sister doing things "her way."<br/>_____________________________</p><p>Anyways, La Pucelle is pretty good so far. I'll let you know how things turn out. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Escape, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis">Sasha @ Escape, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 12, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Intro / History</b></div><p>I remember as a child receiving Nintendo Power every month. I'd look forward to it. A decade ago, you'd have to resort to video game magazines to find out information about a game and whether or not it's worth your time. You'd rely on a paid opinion, and Nintendo Power was notorious for hyping the game with highest bid.</p><p>In February of 1991, Metal Storm graces the cover of Issue 22 with the cover art, a 12 page spread of maps and strategy going across the back-side of the poster, and also the poster itself had the Metal Storm Mech (though that could have been a different month). Quite a lot of press. Thanks to the Nintendo Power hype machine, I was exposed, but at the time I didn't think anything of it because I was more focused on Mega Man, Mario, and Sonic.</p><p>Flash forward to a couple years later when I read a review of the game saying it was the hardest nintendo game to date. "Oh really? Metal Storm?" I muttered to myself. Interesting. At least I think this review said it was the hardest. Maybe they meant hardest to find or something.</p><p>Flash forward again to last night when I finally played the game for the first time. This game is pretty damn awesome. It is quite tough, but it's that challenging kind of tough, not the impossible kind of touch. Zach and I ended up beating the game through on Normal in one sitting last night in the span of about maybe 2 hours. It's not that the game is so difficult, it's just a different point of view getting used to playing with gravity.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot00.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot00.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot00.webp" /></p><p><b>Metal Storm</b> / Nintendo Entertainment System / 1990-91 / Irem (the makers of R-type)</p><p>Metal Storm is a side-strolling 1 player game where you control a mecha through 7 action-filled levels. Each level has 2 parts and then a boss with the except of level 7 where you just fight all the previous bosses again. There's no real story except what the game tells you at the very end after defeating the final boss.</p><div class='title'><b><u>POSTIVES</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Game Design</b></div><p>Metal Storm has two very unique game design features that i haven't seen in any NES game, or any other video game past that.</p><p>1. You can shift the gravity of the stage, so you either run across the ground, or run across the ceiling. It may seem like a dumb idea, but this key feature makes the game challenging to try and defeat enemies while navigating the levels.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1a.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1a.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1a.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1b.webp" /></p><p>2. Levels are vertically infinite. This goes hand in hand with switching the gravity around. Some stages are just straight, but some stages have you navigate through much larger mazes, where the screen move in all 4 directions, rather than just left and right, or up and down.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot01.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot02.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot02.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot02.webp" /></p><p>Throughout the six actually designed levels of Metal Storm, the design gets more and more intricate. Level 1 is your basic side scrolling level. You don't really need to switch gravity a whole lot, but it's there for you to mess around with and get familiar with it's exploits when in later stages, it is your greatest defense.</p><p>Level 2 gets right into the usage of gravity switching, as shown in those above screen shots. You have to navigate through an infinite maze, where you must switch gravity every now and then in order to correct jump through platforms. and so on....</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Most controls are basic. Run left and a right, jump, and shoot. It takes a little getting used to for switching the gravity. You can switch when you're on the ground or in the air, but you can't continuously switch in mid-air. you must touch the ground before you can change. To change gravity, if you're on the ground you hold up and hit the jump button, or if you're on the celing you hold down and hit the jump button. There's no one button to hit to switch so sometimes you'll be holding the wrong direction trying to change gravity. this is also a little weird when you're on the ceiling and you want to duck, you must hold up, instead of down.</p><p>It takes a little getting used to, but once you get used to it, it's not awkward anymore.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficultly</b></div><p>Gameplay aside, navigating through rightside up and upside down levels simutanously while defending yourself against other mechs, gunners and spaceshits is quite a task. Once you get hit by anything, you die. You don't have a life bar, or anything. You can get an item so you can get hit twice before you die, but thats it. Anything more, would make this game too easy, I'd say. The game gives you infinite continues already, what more do you want?</p><p>This game can get pretty intense, but as said before, it's the good kind of intense. most of the time when you die, it's some dumb mistake you shouldn't have made, not because 25 enemies rushed you (not like the nes could have 25 sprites on a screen at once anyways). All situations in the game can be taken care of with a little patient and practice.</p><div class='title'><b>Animations</b></div><p>For a Nintendo Game, the animation is quite above par. Most walk cycles, explosions, and movements have 5-10 frames each making the game look very fluid, very fast. Some Levels also have multiple layers moving in the background for an added shiny effect. Very high quality stuff packed into this game.</p><div class='title'><b><u>NEUTRAL</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Longevity</b></div><p>As earlier stated, Metal Storm took Zach and me about 2 hours to go through the first time. But there are multiple difficulties once you've completed the game. You get Expert mode, and then after that Second Quest mode. Expert mode features more enemies, and Second Quest features tougher enemies with the exact same stages. It's nothing all that new. If there were a speedrun for this game, it'd probably be about 20 or 25 minutes long, if that.</p><div class='title'><b><u>NEGATIVES</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Sounds</b></div><p>Yeah, the music is pretty boring and generic, and the sounds aren't all that great either. Fortunately the overall game experience isn't tarneshed.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>There is absolutely no inkling of story in this game whatsoever, until you've defeated the final boss and text rolls on the screen telling you what has happened. "but this is the nes age.. story has no place in a side-scroller."</p><div class='title'><b><u>OVERALL</u></b></div><p>Metal Storm features some very very interesting game design concepts that put a very interesting spin on a very overly used genre of the time, which made it both difficult and fun at the same time.</p><p>I'd definately reccommend this to anyone looking for a challenge from the past.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ Tabu, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ Tabu, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
