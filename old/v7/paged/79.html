| June 7, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I've gotten current with One Piece and it seems like ever since they've made it to the Grand Line, the amount of characters who have consumed Devil's Fruit has risen much more than before.  Almost every person, friend or enemy, has a power. So, to keep 'em all straight I thought it'd keep track of all the Devil's Fruit that have been uncovered in the story line in order of appearance, for the most part.</p><p>I put all these details on <a href="/pages/one_piece.html" title="/pages/one_piece.html">this page</a>.</p><p>Luffy's fruit was uncovered in the first episode. And a couple episodes later, the next fruit was uncovered.  The next episode that mentions a different fruit is episode 49 when Alvida returns.  The first 50 episodes of the series has only 3 fruit. Then, the next 50 episodes have 11 fruit.  There were about 2 or 3 per story arc. </p><p>Speaking of story arcs, I made a list of those as well so when we show One Piece at SPAMM on the weekends, we could show the episodes of story arcs, rather than just a set number of episodes per week.</p><p>Episodes 1 : Luffy Intro<br/>Episodes 2 - 3 : Zoro Intro<br/>Episodes 4 - 8 : Captain Buggy<br/>Episodes 9 - 17 : Ussop Story<br/>Episodes 18 - 19 : Luffy & Zoro Story<br/>Episodes 20 - 30 : Sanji Story<br/>Episodes 31 - 44: Nami Story<br/>Episodes 45 - 53 : Buggy & Rogue Town<br/>Movie 2 : The Clockwork Island Adventure<br/>Episodes 54 - 61 : Apis & Dragon's Nest<br/>Episodes 62 - 63 : Laboon & Vivi Intro<br/>Episodes 64 - 67 : Whiskey Peak<br/>Episodes 68 - 69 : Coby Story<br/>Episodes 70 - 78 : Little Garden<br/>Episodes 79 - 91 : Chopper Story & Drum Kingdom<br/>Episodes 92 - ?? : Vivi & Alabasta<br/>Movie 3 : Rare Monster Island, Chopper's Kingdom</p><p>We'd really only be able to get through a certain amount of episodes each week.  And, by the looks of things, we'll probably need to cut in the middle of some of the story arcs, too.</p><p>Looks like the longest story arc in One Piece is 12 episodes long, and the average looks to be around 9 or 10. This is unlike Dragonball Z whose story arcs round out around 30 with main story arcs of 100 episodes.  One Piece has an overall story goal, but the story arcs round out well enough.</p><p>Ya know, the beginning of One Piece was quite fun and the fun continues on through the point they make it to the Grand Line (episode 61). But after that, the whole caliber of the series begins to drop. Before, the fights were more serious and had more emotion. Now it's become a joke. There hasn't been any contest at all. Luffy easily kicks their asses. No suspense, thats it. Hopefully when they fight Crocodile the 'intensity' will return.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Samurai Legend Musashi preview" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/samurai-legend-musashi-preview">Samurai Legend Musashi preview</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Samurai Legend Musashi is the sequel to Brave Fencer Musashi on the Playstation. Even when Squaresoft initially released this game, they knew it wouldn't get much play at all, so they strategically sold the game with a playable demo of Final Fantasy VIII which was one of the highest hyped games of 1998 right along side Zelda: Ocarine of Time.</p><p>Much like Zone of Enders 1, people merely bought the game for the demo. Well, arguably, unlike Zone of Enders 1, Brave Fencer was well worth the standalone purchase without the demo included. Man, I have fond fond memories of early 97 when I originally imported Brave Fencer to play FF8. And, after my 'ol Toys R Us pals had a little FF8 demo party, i devved into Brave Fencer.</p><p>My god, this game was great. It had all the aspects of a great solid adventure title along with a game clock that followed a standard 24 hour day. The characters were fun to interact with. The story was rather basic, but it was still solid at the same time, so it provided for great gameflow.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Is it just me, or does it seems squaresoft is in the market for franchising sequels now? On the playstation, it seemed they had so many standalone singular titles, and now it's sequel here, sequel there. I dunno... They've made Drag-on Dragoon, Kingdom Hearts, and The Bouncer so far on the PS2. But, both The Bouncer and Drag-on Dragoon are terrible, and Kingdom Hearts was made to be a franchise.</p><p>On the Playstation, there was Vagrant Story, Xenogears, Threads of Fate (Dew Prism), Parasite Eve, Einhander, Tobal No. 1 and Brave Fencer Musashi. Plus, Racing Lagoon that didn't make it over, though if I remember correctly it wasn't all that great, anyway.</p><p>It seems like they've focusing more on "sure-thing" titles, rather than a "well at least we can say it's a good game" title, or "at least we can say we made the game we wanted" title, or whatever. Maybe the economy over there factors into it, or maybe they are too hesitant because of their losses from Square pictures, or they want to secure more positive funds before venturing again. I dunno... there are many reasons, I'm sure.</p><p>NONE the less, the thought of a new brave fencer game is very intriguing. ^_^ I mean, I loved that game. And a sequel? Hells yeah.. Bring it on. And, as another insentive that I've been in love with is that the game uses cell-shaded graphics. Check out these shots:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa02.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa02.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa02.webp"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa03.webp"><br /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa04.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa04.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa04.webp"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa05.webp"><br /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa06.webp"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa07.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa07.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/musa07.webp"></p><p>If they can pull off the same gameflow as the previous Musashi, and keep the graphics up to the standard in the industry, I'd say this game will probably be one of squaresoft's best on the ps2.</p><p>This was just announced today or yesterday on the heel of E3. The article ends with saying that Squaresoft will announce further details at E3, so we'll see what happens. ^_^ I hope this game won't suck.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dave Seaman, &quot;Plush&quot; @ Tabu, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dave-seaman-tabu-minneapolis">Dave Seaman, "Plush" @ Tabu, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I worked all Friday and Saturday grinding away at Modern Algebra and SPAMM upkeep. My brain was fried, so I couldn't concentrate today. There's still so much that needs to be done before school finished in 4 weeks.</p><p>Because I was sick, I decided to eat a bunch of ramen! I'm out of eggs, so I just ate the ramen straight with no fancy additions.</p><p>Today was all about <b>Maruchan Brand Ramen Noodle Soup Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>I cracked open my 6-pack that I purchased for a mere 81 cents. It was the deal of the century! 81 cents for 6! I ate 2 earlier. Later on, I ate a third without even cooking it! I just munched on the noodles, and saved the seasoning for the next meal.</p><p>Man, I don't know why people are so down on Maruchan brand ramen. Of course, it's not the best. But it is not terrible. It's the perfect par in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good flavored soup. It doesn't fail at producing reasonably good noodles. And, it doesn't fail at the combination of the two, either.</p><p>I'd say that I ate pretty well today for a net total of 50 cents. What else could you possibly buy for 50 cents? You couldn't buy a Snickers bar. You couldn't buy a bottle of soda. You could buy one of those jumbo gumboils. Or, a hand full of that other crap. But, enough to feed you for a day? No, sir. It also started to heal my illness, too!</p><p>Anywho, despite most people's opinions, I give Chicken Maruchan Ramen a par score of <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. Man, I'm going to buy a few more of these 6 packs before they sell out. I also need eggs, bread, and tuna, and maybe something else to make into fried rice.</p><p>Holy crap! I just noticed that there are recipes on the back to create more interesting dishes. Two of them are standard salads, so who the fuck cares. The other one makes an interesting soup. I should buy some mushrooms and veggies to make this.</p><p>—</p><p>The other day, I had some ramen out of my non-trash stash. I picked out this crazy Korean stuff, <b>Secret Samyang Brand Roasted Chajang Chacharoni Noodles</b>. Secret only because the brand name was hidden on the other side of the package. Hiding something, maybe?</p><p>It was certainly interesting. Everything seemed normal until I added the seasoning into the mix. As I squeezed out the beef stuff, it looked like globs of black ink. It didn't want to come out. When it did, it was heavy and stuck together. After I got most of it out of the pouch, I stirred and blended it into the soup. It turned instantly dark! The noodles absorbed a good amount of the ink, too.</p><p>It tasted pretty good! Though, I'm not sure what was in the other pouch. It could've been cat food for all I know. Little crunchy looking pellets that seemed to disappear once they were added in the soup</p><p>It was quite different than any ramen I've had before. Though, it wasn't all that great. I give Samyang's Roasted Chajang Chacharoni a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Interesting stuff, though there is better. Worth at least one try.</p><p>—</p><p>For my second entree, I wanted something I knew would be crap. I wanted to balance out of the meal with what I just had. I also wanted to save the good stuff, too. I ended up going with <b>5-Minute Express Instant Ramen Noodles Chicken Flavor</b>.</p><p>These were the cheap Canadian noodles I found at the Dollar store. </p><p>Not a whole lot can be said about this stuff. It also had a solid base with no extra bells or whistles. No veggies or strange soup altering agents. Just simple noodles, and simple soup.</p><p>All in all, I thought it was good. But after my Maruchan Chicken binge earlier today, it pales in comparison to the standards of the United States. I gave 5-Minute Express Chicken Ramen a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Not only does Maruchan taste better, but it's cheaper, too. For the same price, I could get an alternative flavor of Maruchan, rather than Chicken.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to School Work and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/school-work-and-ramen">School Work and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All those software projects have backed up since my group and I didn't meet last night. Now, we have to scramble today to catch up. We have a lot of work to do in the next week. I have lots of assignments due tomorrow, too. @_@</p><p>Sigh, but in other news, I had some more ramen this afternoon. Some pretty good stuff, too!</p><p>First off, I had <b>Samyang Brand Sutah Ramen Rich Hot Flavor</b>.</p><p>I saw this package, and I immediately thought, "Holy shit! This is what I'm having today!" Although, I am skeptical now when making Samyang ramen. All their previous ones had turned into sludge, and this is not what I want. Maybe this one would have, too, but I made some corrections. After placing the noodles in the water, I added a little more water. It cooled down the boil, but I let it sit for a few minutes.</p><p>This meal was quite extensive, like the Nong Shim stuff. There was a pouch of soup base, a pouch for the veggies, and another pouch of solid base. I put the solid base in the water first. A little alter, I added the veggies, soup base, and an egg, too.</p><p>This stuff turn out FANTASTIC! Extremely delicious. I was surprised. Although, it makes sense given the quality of packaging and ingredients. It was pretty hot & spicy, but just right for my taste buds. The noodles and seasoning blended perfectly together for the slightly baked taste. Great stuff! I give Sutah Ramen a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Nice job!</p><p>Secondly, I had <b>Nissin Brand Instant Noodles Prawn Flavor</b>.</p><p>Prawn is another specie of Shrimp, by the way. This ramen is also known as the one with the little ramen guy running around on the cover.</p><p>I am a little biased towards Seafood flavored noodles because I LOVE seafood quite a lot. And this stuff totally delivered on the taste. Very seafood-esq. Though, the overall quality of the dish was similar to the cheapness of Maruchan and other American brand noodles. Chucks of crab may have saved this dish, so maybe I'll try that next time.</p><p>Anywho, I give this one a <b>3 out of 5 stars</b>. It wasn't bad, but it lacked in overall style and deliciousness.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ramen Catchup" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ramen-catchup">Ramen Catchup</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 5, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After finally getting caught up with everything in my school life, I started cooking up some of the ramen that I acquired over the weekend.</p><p>First off, I made <b>Nong Shim Brand Neoguri Udon Noodle Soup Seafood & Spicy</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_udon.webp" /></p><p>This was a dish I had made before, but I didn't grade it. I think I fucked up making it or something. They are supposed to be udon noodles, so making them in the microwave is a bit tricky. It takes a lot longer for the noodles to absorb the boiling water and soften. Now, it's no longer a problem for me because I'm using a stovetop. Cooking ramen over heat is the absolute best way to get the best taste out of the instant noodles.</p><p>This stuff was quite good this time. I don't remember how it ended up last time. Probably, the noodles were still hard and tasted funny. Not this time, though. The noodles absorbed the water and seasoning beautifully, and tasted so delicious. The soup was also quite delicious. The perfect blend of spice, veggies, and egg. No ramen sludge. I give Nong Shim's Seafood & Spicy Udon Noodles a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Extremely delicious! And extemely recommended.</p><p>---</p><p>Next up, to counter the Korean excellent, I went with the instant bowled <b>Nissin Brand UFO Yakisoba Oriental Noodle w/ Soup Base</b>.</p><p>Yes, UFO as in Unidentified Flying Object, as spelling out on the cover. I don't get it, but this stuff was certainly NOT out of this world.</p><p>It's not possible to make Yakisoba how it was illustrated on the cover. It can only end up being noodles with yakisoba flavoring. And the yakisoba flavoring tasted like runny meat. It wasn't as bad as that Ichiban Yakisoba, though. This stuff didn't have that crappy taste, and it pulled itself together a little bit. Someone who actually liked yakisoba would proably like it. I give UFO Yakisoba a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. I don't think it's possible to make a truly good instant Yakisoba.</p><p>---</p><p>And finally, last week sometime, I made <b>Myojo Brand Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Crab Flavor</b>.</p><p>Speaking of noodles you can't possibly translate into an instant meal, udon noodles will never turn out how they are supposed to. Completely absorbent of their seasoning and meat products soaked in the soup. I tried to boil them longer with the soup base in the broth, but it just doesn't work.</p><p>None the less, this stuff didn't turn out too bad. I find it really odd how well eggs break up in the soup base when making these refrigerated instant meals. It's really weird. Also weird, this stuff tasted nothing like crab. It tasted more like that Chicken flavor in the Maruchan brand ramen. Next time I make this stuff, I certainly must add in that immitation crab they sell at my local grocer. That'll prove to be a delicious meal. But, in the mean time, Myogo Udon Noodles gets a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Better luck next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dusk before Dawn @ Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dusk-before-dawn-minneapolis">Dusk before Dawn @ Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, it's still early in the week, and I've got plenty of time to do everything. I plan to jet over to Madison tomorrow to do some banking, but I can't stay there for too long. I gotta get back and get stuff done!</p><p>Today for lunch, I filled up with <b>Samyang Brand Sogokimyun Ramen</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_sogokimyun.webp" /></p><p>This stuff ended up just like the previous Samyang Ramen...  Sludge. I added a little more water this time, but still, it ended up in sludge. Although, it was very tasty sludge. Pretty good, in fact. It had a very robust strong flavor. Not all THAT great, but pretty good. <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>.</p><p>BUT! After that, I had <b>Sapporo Ichiban Brand Kitsune Japanese Style Noodle</b> with Fried Bean Curd & Soup Base.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/sapporo_kitsune.webp" /></p><p>This stuff...  I can't began to describe this stuff. It began looking promising. But, the hint of beef in the seasoning prepared me for a runny meat texture. Cooking the stuff wasn't so bad. The noodles were shaped into a square, but not in a manufactured way, like the Maruchan stuff. The noodles were fatter than regular noodles, too. They seemed to be randomly arranged, but broke apart in the boiling water nicely.</p><p>Inside, with the soup base, there was a chunk of fried bean curd. I'm not very judgey when it comes to food, so I threw it all in the dish. I don't konw if it was supposed to break apart in the water, but it did not. It stayed together as one big chunk while it cooked and even after. Actually, looking at the wrapper, maybe I'm supposed to cut it out.  Oops. I put the whole thing in my mouth and took a bite. *BARF* Ugh. I can't desribe how terrible this stuff tasted. I think the closest taste I could compare it to is vomit. At least, that's exactly how my mouth tasted after I spit it into the garbage. Maybe it's better when cut?? DO NOT eat that thing whole.</p><p>Even after that, the ramen did have that runny beef texture I had prepared for. The noodles were really good, though. I give this one a <b>2 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Sapporo Ichiban has potential, but I don't know why they keep fucking up. There must be an excellent Ichiban Ramen combination out there. This will be my future goal when I return to the Asian market.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to SPAMM Trip and Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spamm-trip-and-ramen">SPAMM Trip and Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 28, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The SPAMM trip yesterday to Madison was very enjoyable. We went to the Korean Market, which had a whole aisle of instant noodles! KOREAN instant noodles. The best kind! I bought some bean sprouts and a bunch of ramen for $7.24. The concluded with our dinner at Ginza. I didn't order too much (only $12). It worked out because other folks ordered too much, and I ate their food.</p><p>Then, we returned back to Platteville to the SPAMM house, drank, and played Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.</p><div class='title'><b>Later...</b></div><p>Even though I skimped on food in Madison, I've totally blown my food budget for the month. I mean, I have enough food to last for a while, but I really need to pay attention to how much I spend.</p><p>Anywho, with this in mind, let's eat some ramen! Tonight I began with <b>Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup</b></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/nongshim_tangmyun.webp" /></p><p>There were very helpful instructions on the back: <br/>Step 1 - Boil Noodles<br/>Step 2 - Cook in the Soup Base and Veggies<br/>Step 3 - Cook in the Solid Base (and add an egg and whatever else)</p><p>This is now my preferred method of cooking noodles.</p><p>Perhaps the most underrated feature of Nong Shim instant noodles is that noodles come in a circular disk, rather than a square. It breaks apart in the water naturally. AND it actually fits in the pot perfectly. Square noodles have an awkward shape that I need to squish into my pot. Also, square noodles don't really break apart naturally. There are always chunks stuck together, which tear the noodles. Circular noodles stay fit, so you'll have one continuous noodle in the end. ^_^</p><p>Secondly, the veggies from Nong Shim complement the taste of the soup perfectly. So delicious. I added in some bean sprouts and an egg to this ramen, and they soaked up my of the broth's flavor.</p><p>Overall, this stuff was exteremely delicious. I give Nong Shim Brand Mu-Pama Tang Myun Noodle Soup a perfect <b>5 out of 5 stars</b>. Don't miss this stuff! If you live in Madison, but the 5-pack. I think it was only $3!</p><p>After the delicious stuff, I tried a different brand rather than eating all of my Nong Shim stuff on the first day. I went with <b>Samyang Foods Brand Kimchee Ramen</b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/samyang_kimchee.webp" /></p><p>It was rather interesting, much like the preview Ottogi Brand Jin Ramen. I don't know if it's the noodles, the soup base, or the amount of water or heat, but the whole thing came out like sludge. Very heavy. I cooked it the same way as the Nong Shim Brand stuff, but it came out as sludge.</p><p>Ramen sludge isn't all that different than normal ramen. The taste is still there. The noodles stick together a little bit, so it's difficult to pull them apart while you eat.</p><p>It wasn't bad, though. Still better than normal American noodles. Although, it cannot stand up against the Nong Shim excellence. I gave Samyang's Kimchee a <b>3 1/2 out of 5 stars</b>. Good effort, mate! Perhaps I should try again and avoid the sludge to experience what you were going.</p><div class='title'><b>Later yet...</b></div><p>I played a lot of DDR Revivial tonight. I was so hungry that I couldn't go to bed, so I made some of the refrigerated udon noodles, <b>Chikara Brand Udon Hot & Spicy Oriental Style Noodes</b>. I bought them a while ago.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/chikara_udon_spicy.webp" /></p><p>Hot & Spicy is the over statement of the century here. Although, not surprising from an American company.</p><p>These turned out pretty good, but there's got to be a better way to cook them. Udon noodles are supposed to absorb the taste and have a meaty structure. These noodles were very watery with little taste. I don't get it. Although, because of this, the egg breaks up more naturally compared with cooking the dried out instant noodles. Almost like egg drop soup. ^_^</p><p>Overall, I give Chikara's Udon Spicy Noodles a <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>. These noodles never seem to turn out right, and I'm probably not the reason. I will need to experiment further next time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cosmo Life コスモぐらし" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cosmogu">Cosmo Life コスモぐらし</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 24, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/cosmogu.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/cosmogu.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/cosmogu.webp" /></p><p>Since yesterday, I noticed a squaresoft article on GameWatch for a Windows game that I had never heard.  I looked at the past articles for the game, and to my excitement there was a demo version for download.  Excellent! So, I downloaded the 190mb file and then today I remembered to install it.  It took a while to install, and then it took even longer to download the 116mb patch to be updated.  But now that I finally got to the login screen, I'm stuck. This is the demo version, but I need a username and password to continue.</p><p>At this point, I broke my "too cool to auto-translate Japanese language" attitude and let babelfish decypher the japanese into something I could read and understand. Apparently to get this ID, you need to subscribe for 500 yen a month to some japanese website service thingy.  Well, I don't think so, especially for a demo.</p><p>So, I looked a little further into the game, and the more I found out about the game, the more interesting it became.  First off, the game is about 95% enix of the squarEnix brand name.  And secondly, this is some mmorpg where you raise crops and then synth them into furniture, robots, and other stuff for your house or yourself.  You could also sell them for money and buy more crops, or something like that.  The GameWatch article states that it is very much like The Sims online. But from what it sounds like, a little bit of Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon were added into the mix as well.</p><p>Hurrah, another one of these games right?  While gameplay is half the battle, the graphics and art for this game range pretty high past any weird factor Animal Crossing has. Here is a sample of what characters look like in the game:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image6.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image6.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image6.webp" /></p><p>I took that image from this guy's (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040417111608/https://www.tomosuke.to/cosmogu/" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20040417111608/https://www.tomosuke.to/cosmogu/">http://www.tomosuke.to/cosmogu/</a>) gameplay diary.  It looks likes he's been playing the game since it's release back in September last year.  I think that's when it came out anyways. That demo article on GameWatch was dated August 30th.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image9.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image9.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image9.webp" /></p><p>This game looks funnier than hell. Hopefully the minimalist tone of the title screen is an omen of how the music in the game will progress.  Though, if I decide to mess around with trying to sign up for the game, I think I'll do that over summer when I have time/money to waste on such an endevor.</p><p>Though, my spare time will probably be used playing Harvest Moon, Pikmin 2 (which comes out May 1st over here), Xenosaga 2 (which comes out june 24th in japan), or Gran Turismo 4 (which comes out late July or early August).  Drag-on Dragoon is also out right now but I hear that it sucks.  And then even later this year Final Fantasy XII, Viewtiful Joe 2 and even a new Zelda GC game are to be released.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image32.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image32.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image32.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image33.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image33.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/cosmogu/Image33.webp" /></p><p>Not too mention, I won't have a hell of a lot of free time.  I think working 2 jobs over summer will almost have to be mandatory to keep up with expenses throughout the next year, if I do indeed buy a car. And even working two jobs as much as possible I won't be able to see Kristina as much..  ugh..  It'll all work out though, hopefully.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/80">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/78">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
