| May 4, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Musical Weekend</p><p>This weekend, I happened to do a lot of music related activities.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathan Coulton @ Majestic</b></div><p>On Friday, Jonathan Coulton was in town and brought his pals Paul and Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" /></p><p>Paul and Storm were a decent opening act, but a lot of their humor feel short with me.  I thought the bulk out their comedy was a little too obvious and wasn't really as clever as Coulton's songwriting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" /></p><p>Coulton was absolutely hilarious though. ^_^  My favorite part of the night was totally his live rendition of Mr. Fancy Pants with his Midi Controller in which he rick roll'd several times.  I tried to find a YouTube of him doing it, but it appears he does that song differently each time.</p><p>Coulton was great, but the best part of the night was running into plenty of friends whom I thought would show up and some I didn't expect ^_^.  I went with Tony and Erika, and met up with Dan & Becky.  Stacie was there too; I hadn't seen her in a while.  One of my co-workers, Chris, got in at the last minute.  And Kyle Heins, too!  If this was slightly coordinated better, we could've hung out for a while, but oh well.  Tony, Erika, Dan & Becky and I went to a bar downtown for a while before heading home for the evening and that worked out great ^_^</p><p>Also, I probably could've taken better pictures, but I decided to hang out and listen to the music and my top priority of the evening instead.  Plus, the whole place was decked out with chairs.. how the hell are you supposed to get into the music when you're sitting on your ass!?  Oh well, these songs weren't really the dancing or rocking out variety.</p><div class='title'><b>Eccentric Beats 5 Year Anniversary</b></div><p>The next day, I took a greyhound up to Minneapolis to catch Eccentric Beats 5 year anniversary in 1st Ave's VIP room.  My little sister picked me up from the bus stop, we hung around for a bit, and went downtown with her friend Phil.</p><p>For their 5th Anniversary, Phil Good and the crew got <b>Phil K</b> to headline their event with a couple other people ahead of time.</p><div class='title'><b>Symmetry Jen & Ricky the Golden Child</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0868.webp" /></p><p>When we finally got inside, we were greeted with Jen and Ricky who were quite fun. ^_^  I don't exactly remember what genre they were spinning.  Breaky House, maybe?  I dunno...  I'm horrible with that side of the spectrum.</p><div class='title'><b>Leon J</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0873.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0873.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0873.webp" /></p><p>Before we knew it, Leon J got his turn on the decks and the night was absolute gold.  Leon J tore the tracks up and down and all over the place.  His energy kept the beat very strong and very hard minute after minute after minute.  My night was made, thanks to him.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0874.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0874.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0876.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0876.webp" /></p><p>He handed out a couple of CDs and I snatched one right away.  As his music filled the entire room, more and more people began to show up and the people began to fill in all the space the music occupied.  Everyone was up on their feet and moving around thanks to Leon J.  Leon's hour was over far too quick.</p><div class='title'><b>Phil K</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0883.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0883.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0883.webp" /></p><p>A little bit after midnight, Phil K arrived and took over.  He started with some smooth sounds and it felt pretty standard the whole night.  Maybe I don't have the ear I thought I did for his music, but Leon J stole the show, in my opinion.  Phil K's could not reach the energy level Leon already hit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was a fantastic night ^_^.  It was the first time I had ever been to 1st Ave, despite it being the oldest running venue in Minneapolis.  It was also the first time I got to bring my little sister along, so that was fun too.  Afterwards, she brought me to her bars down in Hopkins and we got to run around and be belligerent drunks and ruin people's Sunday mornings.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to WiiFit will not work on me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wiifit-will-not-work-on-me">WiiFit will not work on me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>.. and it especially won't with that attitude.</p><p>Today, Michael from Dubuque posted the following link in his livejournal: <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/wii-fit/" title="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/wii-fit/">The Great Experiment: Wii Fit</a>.  This is a weekly report by Eau Claire / No Brand Con legend Vinnk, in which every week he's been diligently using Wii Fit in an effort to lose weight and gain a better attitude towards exercise in general.</p><p>Looking at the results of this experiment, it worked amazing for him. ^_^.  <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2008/04/02/the-great-experiment-wii-fit-%e2%80%93-final-report-or-how-i-lost-10-pounds-in-7-weeks-by-playing-video-games/" title="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2008/04/02/the-great-experiment-wii-fit-%e2%80%93-final-report-or-how-i-lost-10-pounds-in-7-weeks-by-playing-video-games/">The Final Report</a> is proof of that.</p><p>Hey, that's great that WiiFit can guide people to a better, more fit life, but it's not going to work for me, nor many many other people that think it will.</p><div class='title'><b>8 years ago</b></div><p>In the year 2000, I was a chunky dude.  I'm not the fittest guy today, but back then I was far worse.  Then one of my friends introduced me to Dance Dance Revolution.  He had just gotten back from Japan and picked up DDR 3rd Mix new in stores.  I didn't buy the dance pads or anything gay like that..  I played on the controller and got to know the songs.  I liked it a lot.</p><p>DDR became one of my top favorite games and I continued to purchase the new ones as they came out.  Then college rolled around.</p><div class='title'><b>2002</b></div><p>I loved DDR, but I was a controller nut.  I never touched the pads because I felt too silly and stupid.  But like most major changes in my life, I met someone.  Darlene was both a geek and a dancer and started the first DDR Night at UW-Platteville, that I whole-heartily supported.  My feet had never touched the DDR pads, but using the controller was not an option for this night.  So I hopped on the pads for my first time and sucked horribly.</p><p>Everyone else really wondered how I sucked so bad when I had been playing the game for two years already.  The proof came at the end of the night when I picked up a controller and tapped away at it.</p><p>This was the beginning though...  She and I kept the DDR Nights coming and I played/practiced the game at least 2 hours a day.  I loved the music, the gameplay, and Darlene was the perfect partner to face off against and provided the perfect goal to reach towards.</p><p>As the months went on, the pounds shed off of me.  Foods and Drinks such as Pizza and Mt. Dew just didn't sit well in my stomach anymore.  It felt heavy and I couldn't consume such products anymore.  I switched to a lighter meal and juices and such.</p><p>In a matter of half a year, I was nearly 45 lbs lighter.  I was a rough 200 pounder when I first stepped on the pads, but by summer I had gotten so close to the 150 mark.  When I returned to my summer job, my co-workers thought I was sick or contracted some sort of illness..  only DANCE FEVER!!</p><div class='title'><b>The years went on</b></div><p>DDR Sunday Nights was one of the highlights of my week, along-side SPAMM and other college activities.  But attendance did falter a bit and DDR, as a series, really began to stale.  DDR kept continuing to climb in popularity but after DDR Extreme Japan was out there was a massive drought.  DDR Extreme USA sucked balls, and subsequent releases were no where near the callibur of Extreme Japan.</p><p>Darlene graduated in May 2004 and the Nights were difficult to get going with myself alone.  The Nights were revived along-side the ACM Thursday Night LAN parties, but that was the only time I played anymore.  And even some nights I didn't even play.. I just brought it with.</p><p>I was still eating right and walking everywhere and with my busy busy schedule, I had a huge amount of energy and DDR really helped me power through the last 2 years of college with gusto.  However, the only time I really got back into DDR was in Japan with DDR Supernova.</p><div class='title'><b>In retrospective...</b></div><p>Overall, DDR helped shaped my perspective of an active lifestyle.  I felt fit and had a ton of energy throughout my day.  I was eating better, too.  However, the pounds came back after I started working at Widen and had nothing to do with my time other than play games, watch movies and sit on my ass all day and work.  I don't really need a hell of a lot of energy because I'm not doing anything that needs it.  So, at the end of last year, I had pretty much returned to my pre-DDR weight.</p><p>Smashing my car actually helped a lot though, because now I'm forced to walk everywhere and somedays I walk rather far distances.  I usually make a bunch of phone calls while walking, so I'm never bored.  I'm down 15 to 20 on average and feel quite great.</p><p>Japan was a huge pyschology impact on "walking" for me because I know how much distance I'm capable of traveling.  Walking all the way from my office to the Capital of madison doesn't bother me at all..  That's like a drunken walk home from the bars in Sumiyoshi to me.  3 miles?  pfft..  I've done that nearly passing out before.</p><div class='title'><b>WiiFit</b></div><p>I think it's great that Vinnk has had a similar video game exercise experience, but there's no way it'll captivate me the way DDR did.  DDR's music was what interested me the most, not the weight-loss.  WiiFit is all weight-loss in a very stoic comparative fashion.</p><p>Brain Age was done in the EXACT same way.  I actually stuck with Brain Age 1 for longer than I bet most people did.  Almost a whole 2 months, actually.  I had an entry for every single day.. but it eventually died for me.  The same stupid mini-games every single day can wear very very fast.  The bite-sized 30 second tests are the real killer and that's all WiiFit is.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">WiiFit won't work on me because it's more "Brain Training" except you're using your body rather than the stylus.  It's a gimmick that'll last maybe a month or two, and then take up dust in the corner.  This is definitely a great way to start a life of being fit, but if you don't have those hooks to keep you being fit after you've gotten bored of WiiFit, it's basically worthless and you'll gain all the weight back.</span><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 2008 Summer Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/2008-summer-movies">2008 Summer Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This summer is huge for movies and there are a bunch I'm particularly interested in.<br/>___</p><p>April 18th - <b>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</b><br/><a href="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/" title="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/">Imdb</a></p><p>Written and Starring Jason Segal, one of the vets from Apatow Productions, plays opposite Kristen Bell who break up in the beginning of the movie and Segal goes to great lengths to forget her and fails miserable.  The ads on TV don't really paint this movie in a fantatic light, but that was the same for Knocked Up and Superbad.  I guess we'll see.<br/>___</p><p>May 2nd - <b>Iron Man</b><br/><a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/" title="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Imdb</a><br/>___</p><p>May 9th - <b>Speed Racer</b><br/><a href="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/" title="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/">Imdb</a></p><p>I've been hyped up for this movie ever since I saw the first images and trailer.  This is the kind of movie that hype lends rather well because you know exactly what to expect from it.  Sweet sweet eye candy.  Speed Racer looks absolutely amazing, full of vibrant colors and life, fast paced action in a very anime style.  And with the wachowski brothers at the helm, this movie won't fail at those points.</p><p>I have no doubts the story will be utter crap, acting may be poor, and the whole family-centered attitude will constantly annoy me, but the action will probably make up for it.  I'm psyched.<br/>___</p><p>May 22nd - <b>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</b><br/><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html" title="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/">Imdb</a><br/>___</p><p>June 13th - <b>The Incredible Hulk</b><br/><a href="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/" title="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/">Imdb</a></p><p>I dunno... I'll probably see this movie if other people are going.  The previous Hulk movie was rather horrible, but this new Hulk stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner.  That along makes it worth viewing, in my opinion.<br/>___</p><p>July 2nd - <b>Hancock</b><br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/" title="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/">Imdb</a></p><p>Hancock looks absolutely hilarious.  Will Smith plays a bum with super-powers and doesn't care about the damage caused by "Saving the Day".  Eventually Will Smith runs into Jason Bateman who tries to reabilitate him into a stereotypical do-gooder.  Or something like that.

| April 16, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, I went up to Minneapolis to check out Sasha and Digweed on tour together for the first time in 6 years.  The last time, they brought the sounds of Delta Heavy throughout North America and the rest of the world.  This year, they're starting off the Spring season of clubbing the very same way.</p><p>In Minneapolis, they came to Epic, which everyone in Minneapolis would know formerly as The Quest.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting to Minneapolis</b></div><p>As most of you know, near the end of 2007 I smashed my car and have been making use of public transportation rather than buying a new one.  This works out pretty good for getting around madison, but making it outside of madison can be difficult.  Since I couldn't find anyone to go on a work night, I had to do a little investigating into the cheapest way to travel 300 miles north by north-west.</p><p>I settled on taking a fancy greyhound bus since it was super-cheap.  It cost $88 round-trip and took 5.5 hours.  That's almost cheaper than driving actually, since it was always take me almost 2 tanks of gas to get there and back.  PLUS, now I can sleep on the way up and have plenty of energy for the club.</p><p>The greyhound station in minneapolis was only a few blocks away from Epic, so this was a very very lucrative offer.  Unfortunately, I waited until the night before to buy the tickets, so I had to get to the station in Madison earlier than I would've liked to redeem my tickets.</p><p>It wasn't half bad...  Though, I got to Epic about half an hour early, so I sat outside until the doors opened.  The "line" was rather disappointing.  6 years ago when waiting outside of the same place half an hour early on a work night, the line stretched along the sidewalk to the edge of the building.  Today, around the same time, I was the only one that made up the line.  Rather sad, if you ask me, but it didn't that long for people to show up after I did.</p><div class='title'><b>Epic</b></div><p>Over half an hour later, music finally began to seep through the open doors and crawl into the streets like a mist.  After trying to figure out when we were going to get in, the music acted as a starting bell as we jumped off our marks and filed inside.</p><p>Epic was actually pretty nice.  It had been almost 3 years since the last time I stepped into the quest and that was when they shoveled James Holden up into the back room, rather than the main stage.  You could still tell it was the quest, but they made some very nice changes to the place to make it more accessible.</p><p>Changes such as flattening all of the first floor to the same level, rather than having a raised dance floor and a fenced off area in the back.  They also chucked all the chairs and tables on the ground floor, and had very few tables here and there for standing.  They took out a little bit of the balcony facing the stage and put in a stair-case right in the middle of the club, rather than going through the back room.  All those crappy TVs are gone and replaced with flat screens.  Nearly all the walls glow and change colors with the rest of the lights.</p><p>The Quest went through a huge makeover thanks to the new management.  Epic is still very much The Quest, but with much more than just a new coat of paint.  Plus that scafolding is no longer hugging the front of the building.  That's a huge plus.  There's still some road construction out front, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Kazel</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0574.webp" /></p><p>The night began with the very solid sounds of Kazel.  He did an excellent job of setting the tone for the evening. I don't really remember most of his set because of what was to come after, but I was never bored during his time.  It built to the suspense and excitement of Sasha and Digweed.</p><p>At the same time, I was amusing myself with some of the crowd members.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0587.webp" /></p><p>One of the most beautiful things of the evening, were the visuals up on the stage.  It was fitted with tons and tons of LED lights, which formed something simliar to a Jumbotron screen right in front of us.  The visuals used on these LEDs were stylistic 2D graphics in a 3D space.  Mostly shapes moving around and different colors, whee!  It was quite pretty.0</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha and Digweed</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0607.webp" /></p><p>After plenty of time to build a massive crowd, Sasha and Digweed took over the stage, finished up Kazel's last track, and Sasha began his sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0605.webp" /></p><p>Sasha took the point position with Abelton.  Unlike Delta Heavy or previous Sasha and Digweed collaborations, this was pure Sasha.  He has evolved passed fundacion, but it's still very similar.  His entire set up on the stage sounded like one big song, rather than flippin' back and forth from 'record' to 'record'.</p><p>I dunno... I feel like I'm missing something when I hear Sasha these days.  It's been like these since Fundacion for me.  Maybe I just don't have the ears..</p><p>Don't get me wrong though.. It was still pretty badass. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0609.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0609.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0609.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0612.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Digweed</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0643.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0643.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0643.webp" /></p><p>After an hour, It was John Digweed's turn.  Much like Sasha, Digweed played his own stuff and he played it hard.  In my opinion, Digweed totally stole the show.  His songs pounded with a thunderous beat while a flutter and flicker..  a very slight hint of melody guided you from track to track.</p><p>I should really keep up with the Kiss 100 RSS feed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0633.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0633.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0633.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0678.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Sasha and Digweed</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0683.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0683.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080416_sashadigweed/IMG_0683.webp" /></p><p>For the final hour, Sasha came back and tag teamed with Digweed.

| April 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The last couple days of our trip to Japan consisted of shopping around to various locations rather than the sight-seeing fair we've been doing nearly the entire trip so far.</p><div class='title'><b>Hamanomachi</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0477.webp" /></p><p>For our last full day in Nagasaki, we started shopping downtown.  There was quite a bit that had changed downtown I wasn't really expecting.  For example, the You-Ing, which used to be on the corner downtown had moved into the prime 6 floor location of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0474.webp">Hamanomachi</a>.  It looked like the whole downtown area right outside Hamanomachi was going through some huge changes, too.  It'll probably look completely different in another year.</p><p>As luck would have it, it was Thursday, April 10th, which meant Mario Kart Wii had just come out. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" /></p><p>You-Ing had far more than just those copies and I bet they were completely sold out by Saturday.</p><p>Another big change was that the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp">Sega World</a> was no longer in business.  It don't know how they could've gone out of business, when the place was packed everytime I went there.  There was no sign on the door saying the moved locations either.  Weird...</p><div class='title'><b>More shopping and arcades</b></div><p>After taking a look at some of the other arcades and a couple more stores, we made our way to You-Me Saito and Amu Plaza and tried our luck, unsuccessfully, at some crane games.  Later on, we made it to Taito and found a new Konami Shmup!  It's called Otomedius, another parody spin-off of the Gradius series.  Here's a few pics of the machine (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0480.webp">here</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0481.webp">here</a>).  The screen was very high-res and featured a couple touch options too.  There was a dude playing it though, and those crane games were a little more appealing for the moment, so I didn't play it.  It looked like it played A LOT like parodius though.</p><p>It looked like it could've been fun though...  I'll look it up on wikipedia later.</p><div class='title'><b>Beardo</b></div><p>For the rest of the evening, we returned to Beardo to hang out with Sachi, Yoriko and Nonoka. ^_^.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" /></p><p>And we also proceeded to drink heavily.  Throughout the night, several of the newly initiated JASIN students arrived and we got a chance to talk to them about Japan.  It was really kinda weird though..  It's like watching a new Season of Survivor with a completely new cast of people, when you're totally used to the previous season.</p><p>Kraig Henry showed up again, and began giving the students the run down, more or less.  The students that hung out with us were from New York state, Southern Illinois, La Crosse, WI, Manchester, England, North North England, and France.</p><p>As the night grew thin, we started passing out and had to return to our beds.  We said goodbye to everyone for the evening, but we met up with the Hiro family the next day for lunch. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Friday</b></div><p>For lunch, we went to one of those restaurants on 5th floor Amu.  After lunch, we lost track of time a little bit, and had to run to catch our train back to Fukuoka.  Gage and I ran down to the ticket counter and bought our tickets, while Sachi and Yoriko made it downstairs with Nonoka and Nanase.  The bought some local tickets, so they could say goodbye to us on the platform.  We hopped on the train, and waved goodbye to them just outside as the doors closed.  I sat down in a window seat where they could see me, and continued waving to them.  They even started running after the train a little bit when it took off, it was so sweet ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>Fukuoka</b></div><p>Early in the day, while waiting for Sachi, I emailed Aya since I knew she lived around Fukuoka and made some plans to hang out with her for the rest of the evening.  She actually lived a little further away than I thought she did, but it was still considered in Fukuoka, which was weird.  Her train ride was about an hour to get downtown, whereas our train ride from Nagasaki was about 1 hour 45 minutes.</p><p>Anywho, we finally met up with her and went over to Tenjin to do some more shopping and arcading.  We found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0492.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0492.webp">plenty</a> of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0493.webp">engrish</a> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0494.webp">shirts</a> and played plenty of crane games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0496.webp" /></p><p>But, like our whole trip, time began to fade and we had to say goodbye.  She needed to get back home and we needed sleep for our 7:00 AM flight the next day.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0497.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0497.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0497.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Some TV</b></div><p>Well, we didn't quite make it to bed right away.  Gage wrote up a couple of emails and I watched some TV.  There was a very interesting program on which started off talking about Otaku and Akihabara but blended into Russian-Japanese fandom.  This Japanese otaku flew to Russia and met up with his friend for a tour of this fandom.  They started off with "Bloom", which is some big Russian Cosplay organization, i think?</p><p>They also went around to several Japanese restaurants.  The first of which was a sushi place called Yakitori.  The otaku thought it was odd that the place didn't even have any Yakitori, yet that's what they named the place.  The sushi chef was a roll with very creamy cream cheese, some green onions and some kind of fish that looked like tuna.  The otaku was rather stunned at the cream cheese addition, but was full-out surprised when after the sushi roll was rolled, they deep-fried it in Tempura.  It looked really really good actually, but not to the Japanese.  It looked like he was just being polite when he said "oishii".</p><p>They didn't go into as much detail with other restaurants than to simple make fun of their names.  One restaurant had some kanji on the sign which was missing a stroke.  This really seemed like the exact same "making fun of" us Americans do when we see/read Engrish shirts.

Plates move around the restaurant on a conveyer belt and you just pick up whatever you like.  Each plate is 100 yen, so you eat as much or as little as you like.</p><p>After giving our feet a little rest we went to Yamada in Togitsu, Hard off and Geo and finally found things I was looking for.  I picked up the PSP GPS for $54, the Map pack for $10, Railfan on PS3 for $30, and found some more Capsule toys.</p><p>We finished off the day by visiting Beardo, which was great ^_^.  Nonoka is still really cute, and Nanase is adorable ^_^  All the regulars were there and Clinton stopped by, too.  I also met Henry, a friend of Leigh's, who is currently studying abroad.  I'll take plenty of pictures there when we go back on Thursday.</p><p>On the way back to our hotel, we stopped at Jinya to meet Ryan, who's also back in Nagasaki trying to find work or anything that'll keep him here.  It sounds like JET is a little bloated these days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mt.

The owners of these stands completely pack up everything and re-setup everything every single day.</p><div class='title'><b>Huzzah</b></div><p>So that's it for our first full day in Japan.  We accomplished far more than I ever thought we would.  We left our hotel around 6:30 AM and didn't get back until 9:30 PM at night.  After 15 1/2 hours on foot, we feet we thoroughly ground into hamburger.  When we got back, I literally laid down on the bed and didn't get up until 4:00 AM this morning.</p><p>These are just some of the photos throughout the day.  You can find the rest of the photos below. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Time Table</b></div><p>Here's my plan for the upcoming days:</p><p>On Monday (today, right now), we'll head to Nagasaki and bum around town.  I'll show Gage some of the nifty sight-seeing places like the Atomic Bomb epicenter, Peace Park, probably the Museum too.  We'll probably hit Beardo.  On Tuesday, we'll probably do more of the same but do far more shopping.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ikuko took the day off, so we'll head up to Sasebo to meet her.  I want to check out Hirado castle, which is a little north of Sasebo, and also other places around there where we could find more Sakura ^_^.  We'll spend the night in Sasebo somewhere, probably Cybac or a Karaoke box or something.  Maybe Ikuko has some room at her place.</p><p>On Thursday, we'll head back to Nagasaki but take make some stops in Towns on the way back, like Omura and Isahaya.  Hopefully, Hilary will get back to me about this Italian place, and we'll have some Pizza in Nagayo, too.</p><p>On Friday, we'll head back to Fukuoka and do much much shopping around town.  We didn't really spend a lot of time in stores yesterday, so this'll be the day to make up for that.</p><p>Early Saturday morning is our flight back to the states. :/</p><p>There you have it ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 80s Prom porn @ Inferno" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/80s-prom-porn-inferno">80s Prom porn @ Inferno</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 23, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, Brett and I went to the Inferno Club in Madison.  To date, there has only been one ocassion where I left the establishment satisfied, which was around two years ago when Richard Divine tore up the place (<a href="/old/v7/richard-divine-inferno" title="/richard-divine-inferno">here what i wrote</a>).  The other two times at Inferno had been a stark disappointment.  Extremely low turn-outs..</p><p>When arriving at Inferno around 9:45pm, it seemed like I was being setup for disappointment again.  There were maybe a dozen or two people there, most of which were sipping drinks at the bar.  There was one group that was quite into the scene and were on the dance floor.</p><p>Brett and I found a table off to the side and perched ourselves for the night.  Despite having few people around, the track selection was absolutely amazing.  80s dance hit after 80s dance hit.  Amazing song I never remember this well, to several great songs I had never heard before.</p><p>DJ Smitty was the resident all night long and he kep the hits coming along.  His track selection was top notch.  Unfortunately though, he didn't mix any tracks together at all.  When one song ended, it was a quick to the next.  It was like getting punched in the side or pushed into a wall at the end of every song.  ughh..</p><p>I never got used to his hard cuts, but what can you do really?  The genre is 'retro' which covers ALL genres of dance from the 80s and other eras.  Track mixing really didn't become all that prevalent until the 90s..  I would've liked some effort but towards mixing, but all these songs are so radically different, it would probably be disastrous if you weren't already a mixing god.  Oh well...</p><p>The track selection made the night perfect, and as the night went on..  more and more people did begin to show up and started flocking to the dance floor.  The power of delicious 80s tracks truly did bring people into the venue despite Spring Break and a Snow Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" /></p><p>This event was the highest viewed for the month of March on Inferno's website, so I really wonder what kind of crowds this'll draw when it's not Spring Break and the weather is fine.  80s Night at Inferno is the 3rd Friday of each month, so I guess we'll see next time on April 18th.</p><p>April 18th also happens to be No Brand Con, so I won't be able to get any SPAMM friends to go, but if you aren't going up to Eau Claire that weekend, feel free to stop by Madison, ^_^</p><p>Favorite Track of the Night: Ghostbusters Theme ^_^.  Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough for Smitty to play my request of the Beverly Hills Cop Theme.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/61">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/59">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
