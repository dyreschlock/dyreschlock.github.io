The 2.0 update brings a complete rewrite of progression through leveling, equipment, and other systems. Graphics have been updated for modern consoles and PCs. And a new expansion adds a new story that expands the life of Night City.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Night City is the setting of Cyberpunk, a sprawling multi-leveled metropolis. Depending on where you visit, it can be many things. It's a dark, dank, depressing slum festering with gangs, addicts, and trash. It's a futuristic neon haven vibrant with youth and life. It's a posh urban center of business and industry. It's a crime ridden war zone with constant shoot outs between cops and gangs.</p><p>No matter where you go, the city is dense. Many citizens live in massive mega buildings that act as their own cities. Stores and other places of interest are often on different levels forcing you traverse Night City's maze of verticality. Streets and highways bend and elevate to different areas. The native GPS in the game is a necessity.</p><p>Sprawling out from its dense centers, the outer edges of Night City has oil fields, solar collectors, and farm protected by greenhouses to sustain the massive amount of resources that fuel the city and its people. Small poor neighborhoods also grow on some pockets. Even further away are the badlands, a rocky desert where little grows and dust storms are common. There are also huge trash fields.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cyberpunk depicts a future where many of us think we're headed. Urban centers continue to collect more and more people, and the surrounding environment is ravaged of its resources to sustain them. Singular corporations rule the city and retain most of the wealth, which bleeds its citizens of their lives and dreams.</p><p>This is where the story begins as you play as V.</p><p>- - - - -</p><p>With the new update, I started a new character to see what the game now has to offer, and it's keeping my attention much more than before. I've been streaming it here and there, and taking plenty of photos along the way. I'll keep adding more photos as I continue.</p><p>Eventually, I'll start up the DLC, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shiraki-mine 白木峰" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shirakimine">Shiraki-mine 白木峰</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is one of the tallest mountains in the area at 1596 meters, and on a clear day, you'd be able to view both Toyama and Takayama cities from the top.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I had a friend coming to visit who was interested in doing a million things, and I had this mountain marked on my map from a while ago. So, we decided to take a look!</p><p>The pin on my map was for a parking lot pretty close to the peak, but after searching for hiking paths and current conditions, the Hida wilderness website marked the road closed due to a landslide. There's a hiking website (<a href="https://yamap.com/" title="https://yamap.com/">yamap.com</a>) where people record their hikes, and the most recent hikes of the mountain seemed to confirm it. </p><p>Using yamap as a guide, there were several places where we could start our hike, but ultimately we planned on starting at the campground where the road had been closed and going from there. Hikes on yamap confirmed this was possible.</p><div class='title'><b>The Climb</b></div><p>It took way longer to get to the campground than I had expected. We left a little later than planned, but the winding roads made us move very slowly.  Google Maps said it would only take an hour from my apartment. I think we left around 8:15am and finally made it to the campground at 10:05am. Even though we made two quick stops along the way, it took nearly 2 hours.</p><p>The campground was a nice piece of civilization carved out of the heavy thicket of trees and bushes. There was even a museum, or some kind of cultural hall, that detailed the surrounding nature. We didn't have time for it, though, and went straight on the path forward up the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The path itself was just the closed road, so it was pretty easy. We walked passed several dammed and relegated streams coming from above. Some of the cement structures lower in the streams had been eroded away.</p><p>The climb was steady and kept going and going. It wasn't long before we could see some of the height we had already traveled.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>45 minutes later, we hit the detour.  We had known that the road was closed due to a landslide, and the sign directed us to take this trail instead. It indicated that it led to the summit, and another hiker of their way down informed us that this was the way to go.  So we went.</p><p>Looking at Google Maps, it seems like the trail was about 600 meters.  Certainly not as long as the 3km we had already walked. However, our gradual 20 degree incline significantly spiked to 45 degrees, or more. The course had ropes to help pull ourselves up the climb, but it was still pretty rough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As in any marathon, you continue to push through and continue to move. The longer you stop, the longer it takes. But, my partner in climb doesn't do marathons, so we often took some breaks, which ended up being necessary. This trail completely exhausted my supply of water.</p><p>Another 45 minutes later, we reached the trail head and made it back to paved road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having gained some significant height, and as the paved road winded around the mountain to gain height, we often had a view that looked down on the path we've traveled. Just 10 minutes later, the top of the trail head looked so small and far away. Another 20 minutes later, even further. One of the best parts about this hike we being able to visually observe the distance we had traveled. We wouldn't have gotten this experience by simply driving to the top. On the other hand, we wouldn't have been dying of thirst and exhaustion either.</p><p>After 30 minutes, we reached the upper parking area at 12:15pm. There was no running water, but there were some jugs of water as to use as an emergency. It did not look safe, so we moved onward and upward. Often there were trails that appeared on the side the road that offered us a shorter path to the top. But, we had already experienced the cost of such shortcuts from the detour earlier, so we continued on the road.</p><p>45 minutes later, the emergency shelter came in view. We climbed up to it and took a break inside. Nearly to the top!</p><p>Outside of the shelter gave us our first grand view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think we stopped for about 10 minutes, and continued along the wooden path. Some of the path had degraded, and other parts were washed away from rain. The path looked like it went back down the other side of the mountain, which we didn't want to do. But, I scouted ahead and the path only dipped a little bit.</p><p>Around the corner, the path connected with the ridge line path. Going to the right, it lead to the peak.</p><div class='title'><b>Summit <span class='ja'>山頂</span></b></div><p>After nearly 3 hours of walking and hiking, and a total of around 8 or 9 kilometers, we had made it to the top. From the top, we had a 360-degree view of everything around us. The east (first panoramic photo below), the north (second), and the south and west (third).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The weather was pretty warm with only a few clouds when we started. But, there was a strong wind at the top. The wind had pulled in the clouds (and later on rain), so a lot of the view was covered. We could still see Toyama to the north, though not a lot of detail. To the south, we saw an area that had to be Takayama. We couldn't confirm it, but it couldn't have been anything else.</p><p>It wasn't really cold up there, but the wind was pretty strong. My hat blew clear off my head!</p><p>To the south-west was a Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span>, a small buddhist shrine. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I wonder how many buddhist monks hike the mountain to pray here.</p><p>The other notable location at the peak is a pond to the east. The trail maps said it would take about 25 minutes to get there (and another 25 minutes to get back), but looking at the time, we could not afford to go. We needed to get out of the mountains by sundown (5pm-ish), and we were getting close to that limit with the amount of time it would take to descend.</p><div class='title'><b>Descent</b></div><p>We left the summit before 2pm and took the paved road all the way down. At the top, the paved road began on a disheveled cracked helicopter pad. Moving down the road, some of it had been completely broken apart and ground into rock, but I think a car could still drive across it.</p><p>Turns out, going down the mountain is way more easy than going up. After about an hour, we made it back to the trail head for the detour. We decided to stay on the road this time, and go through construction. We knew how steep and hard the trail would be, and the construction and landslide couldn't be THAT bad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Turns out, we were right. The construction and road repair was already complete. If the gate had been opened at the campsite, we could've driven this whole distance. The construction sign we found a little bit later indicated that the road would be open on October 20th, so maybe they still needed to test their repair, or something.</p><p>This road led off in the opposite direction before meeting back to where the detour began. Going down, it took us 45 minutes from where the trail head ended to where it began. This was the same time it took us to climb up.</p><p>Because it went off into another part of the mountain, I started noticing a lot of vines choking and strangling the trees and brush on the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was so thick. Nothing our size would be able to move through it. Everything was covered with this vine. My friend mentioned that it was probably all one organism, too, that just continued to grow and grow.</p><p>Eventually we made it through the thicket. We reached the start of the trail head and made it to camp, a bit further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the mountain is a bit easier, but the constant stamping of feet on pavement takes it toll on the soles of feet and the hip. But! We arrived and were finally able to refill our water. Another hour of driving through the windy roads, and we were back to civilization.</p><p>It had a been a while since I had been on a hike, and this one turned into one of the longest hikes I've done in Hida. Much like a marathon, you often question why you ever decided to do it not long after beginning. But you move past that feeling and start enjoying the moment, the movement, the nature, and accomplishment. I need to do some more hiking.</p><p>Overall, this was a great hike, even though a bit rough. This would be excellent to do again with absolutely clear weather.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>9:27am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sugadaira Campground <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平キャンプ場</span> </td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (construction)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>End of Trail</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:00pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Emergency Shelter <span class='ja'>避難小屋</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692">36°25'02.1"N 137°06'42.1"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Summit <span class='ja'>白木峰山頂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222">36°24'56.1"N 137°06'44.0"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897">36°24'50.8"N 137°06'39.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:25pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (end) - skipped, took road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>3:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (start)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to car (Sugadaira Camp) <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:55pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>5:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kawai <span class='ja'>河合</span> 471 Interchange</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159">36°18'23.0"N 137°05'31.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wind Castle 風の城" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wind-castle">Wind Castle 風の城</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Despite traveling through the area numerous times throughout the last 10 years, I've never noticed this structure perched on the hill.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp"/></a></p><p>After parking at the Sarukura Forest Park alongside several barbecue bits, you are presented with 440 steps that ascend to an altitude of 345 meters. It takes about 10 minutes, which isn't so bad unless you aren't prepared for it. As you reach the top, you'll find the wind castle, pictured above.</p><p>This is the summit of Sarukura Mountain <span class='ja'>猿倉山</span>, and from the observation deck, you can see all the way to Toyama Bay on a clear day.</p><p>I took a bunch of photos and put them together into a huge panoramic shot.</p><p class='img'><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" /><br/>Hi-Res Panoramic: /wind_castle_panoramic_hi.png (186.5mb)</a></p></p><p>You can see nearly all of Toyama, and there is a free-to-use binocular scope so you see the airport, sports arena, and other areas in clear view.</p><p>Apparently, around 1558 to 1570, the summit of Sarukura Mountain was the site of the Sarukura Castle <span class='ja'>猿倉城</span>, but nothing remains today. The military commander at the time was under the command of the ruler of the Hida region to the south. Hida is surrounded by mountains, so there are very few ways of getting up there. This castle was built to monitor any large armies that may be headed up the mountain to attack.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>This path can be clearly seen today in the above panoramic. There's an incredible clear view of Hwy 41 coming down from Hida. </p><p>It still completely baffles me that I never noticed this place before. Although, I think it's easy to see why I hadn't noticed it before. On my way back home up to Hida, I took some reverse photos looking back at the mountain and the castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The white castle blends into the sky very easily. If you didn't know it was there, you would never notice it. But, once you know that it's there and where to look, it pops out.</p><p>There's also not a whole lot of information about the Wind Castle online. In fact, my friend and I only found this thing by skimming around Toyama in Google Maps looking for something to do. I wanted to know exactly when they built this thing, and its purpose. </p><p>There's a plaque on the Wind Caste which states the following: <br/><b><span class='ja'>平成</span>2<span class='ja'>年度</span></b> <I>Heisei-2 (or 1990)</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>中部通商産業局</span> <span class='ja'>地域エネルギー開発利用発電モデル事業</span></b> <I>Chubu Bureau of International Trade and Industry Regional Energy Development Utilization Power Generation Model Project</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>「風の城</span> <span class='ja'>風力エネルギー開発利用事業」</span></b><I>"The Wind Castle - Wind Energy Development Utilization Project"</I><br/><b>-<span class='ja'>富山県大沢野町</span></b> <I>- Osawano Town, Toyama Prefecture.</I></p><p>Quite a mouthful. Seems like it was built in 1990, although I wanted to find more substantial information online. Eventually I did find a blog post of someone talking about Sarukura castle (explained earlier), and a few other things. In particular, in 1975, as part of Toyama prefecture's 100th year anniversary, a 9.6km trail was opened from Mt. Sarukura to Mt. Kosami Gozen <span class='ja'>小佐波御前山</span>. It didn't mention anything about the Wind Castle at that time. </p><p>I didn't find anything that confirmed its opening in 1990. But, it was probably built in 1990 as its architecture and flashy nature seems to fit that time well. Like everything built during the economic high times of the 80s and 90s in Japan, it is definitely showing wear and tear from the years. Some of the windows have been kicked out, and the metal railing has graffiti almost everywhere. One of the door had been kicked in, too.</p><p>If you've never been, I would absolutely recommend driving up here if you're going to or from Toyama. I will probably return here each time I visit Toyama now. Different weather, different season, and different time of day will all create a new view. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nishi-cho-taiki">Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.</p><p>With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen.

Overall, the calculation method are still based on Gamepress's <a href="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet" title="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet">Comprehensive DPS Spreadsheet</a>, but now I'm pulling my data from Poke_Miner's <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters">Game Master</a> file, and also updated the UI to be more visually appealing and understandable.</p><p class='img'><p class="img"><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter"><b>List of General Raid Counters</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" /></a></p></p><p>In addition, there are two others pages. </p><p><b><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom">Personal Raid Counter List</a></b> —  I made a page that uses Pokemon in my game to determine whether or not I can defeat the raid boss using just my two accounts. It's not up to date. </p><p><b><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top">Top Counters per Pokemon Type</a></b> —  Another page compares Pokemon of each type against a generic Arceus to see which is strongest within each type, and overall. It's up to date, but I haven't focused on readability.</p><div class='title'><b>Purpose</b></div><p>The purpose of these pages is to determine which Pokemon are the strongest against Pokemon that appear as raid bosses. It's very helpful to understand which Pokemon are worth catching and leveling to take down these bosses easily. While they almost always can't be defeated with just one person, every bit helps to defeat them with the fewest amount of people as you can.</p><p>Many sites that focus of Pokemon Go offer lists of the best pokemon, but never with enough detail to understand why they're the best and never on a single page with all bosses available in the game. Gamepress's DPS page is a great resource to see how much more powerful one pokemon is than another, but you have to manually search and filter everything.</p><p>Back in 2019, I first made this page. At the time, it was use the outputted data from Gamepress to create the page. Whenever there was an update, it would take a LOONGG time to redownload everything. So, last year, I rewrote the backend to do all the calculations itself using the same method as Gamepress. There's more information about here on the previous Project post: <b><a href="/old/v7/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old" title="/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old">Previous Post from 2022</a></b></p><div class='title'><b>Update</b></div><p>I liked my previous page, but it was unreadable to anyone else. Also, Gamepress almost never updates its backend data, which my page relied on.</p><p>As mentioned above, this update does two things.</p><p>First, I'm using Poke_Miner's <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters">Game Master</a> file in Github to get my updates of Pokemon and Moves. This gets updated much more frequently when stuff changes in the game. (At least, I think it does.) Going along with this, all Pokemon data and moves are stored in the database, which makes it MUCH easier to change manually.</p><p>Second, I updated the UI. Only I could read it before. Now, I added labels on the numbers, and added images of the Pokemon and more colors, too. The Pokemon images really really pop, and make it super easy to scan the lists. I also added rounded corners, because Fuck yeah!</p><div class='title'><b>Further Updates</b></div><p>I'm not completely happy with a lot of the white-on-white text, so I need to fix that at some point.</p><p>Also, one of my users complained that he still didn't understand anything, so I was thinking of making pages for each raid boss that showed more detail, such as which moves were available, and pokemon types and weaknesses. I'll get to that at some point.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fixing and Modding a PS4 Controller" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller">Fixing and Modding a PS4 Controller</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Some of the other inputs seemed sticky, too. Searching for troubleshooting methods online, one video suggested taking the controller apart to give it a good clean.</p><p>I ran through the cleaning procedure, but it was still broken. Such an annoying shame. However, the video mentioned that the button membranes or the button cable ribbon could be damaged. They were pretty cheap on Amazon! Only $3 for replacement membranes and $5 for a new cable ribbon.</p><div class='title'><b>Fixing</b></div><p>They arrived pretty quickly, so I ran a stream where I tried to fix my controller.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSA6RM1V_jI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Success!  I was really surprised that it worked so flawlessly so easily. These controllers cost $60 new, so I think it's pretty amazing how a simple $5 part could completely fix it. I wonder how many people throw their controller away or sell it as junk online just because of a problem that a simple $3 or $5 part could fix.</p><p>So, fixing this thing was easy. What else could we do?</p><div class='title'><b>Modding</b></div><p>Taking out the buttons is extraordinary simple. They're just plastic pieces siting in a plastic shell. The rubber membranes and cable ribbon underneath do the real work of detecting the button presses. You could put anything on top.</p><p>I found some pretty blue buttons on Amazon that would look nice with the white controller, so I ran another stream where I attempted to replace those buttons.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dD73shUj-uo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>As mentioned on the stream, there was a bit of a problem.</p><p>Not all Playstation 4 controllers are created equal. There have been a few revisions over the years. Of course, I knew this from having to buy the correct button cable film from before, and also noticed that the trigger membranes were different. But, I didn't pay attention when buying the buttons.</p><p>Although the buttons are nearly identical across all revisions, the R2 and L2 triggers are not the same.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In my earlier revision of the controller, the tension and knock back is caused by a spring loaded wire that sits in a pathway on the inner left side of the button.

Also, the touch pad and home button are also black. It wasn't a complete conversion to blue.</p><div class='title'><b>Modding, again</b></div><p>Finding a complete set of buttons for my controller wasn't easy, but they did exist on AliExpress. And for only $3.  There was no way I was going to find a set of buttons with the exact Blue color, but I could find a full set of White buttons that matched the color of the controller. In the end, only a few buttons could be blue and they would really stand out. :)</p><p>Once again, I streamed the process.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PAGyqHwjAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>..and once again not everything was perfect. The white of the buttons was not the exact same color white as the controller. It was more of a warm white, rather than a slate white. Also, the R2 and L2 buttons were closer, but not exact, so they could not be used. R1 and L1 were also wrong. Replacing the touch pad is more involved than it initially looked, too.</p><p>So many problems, but it wasn't all a waste.  The Home, Share, and Options are the same across all model of controllers, so they fit. And the slight difference in color isn't TOO noticeable.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it's not a perfect match, I think it looks better than before. :)</p><p>I like the idea of the face buttons and sticks popping out from the contrast and all the secondary buttons fading into the color of the controller.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing…</b></div><p>For now, I'm going to call this closed. It'll take a bit of searching to try and find the exact colors I want for my model of controller.  More money, more time, more hassle. It's 90% of the way there, and that's good enough.</p><p>The main goal was fixing the controller in the first place, and even more so, I now have an excellent controller to use for the Switch. I bought an 8bitdo wireless adapter for the modded Playstation Classic, which I had given up on. Using it on the Switch instead, the PS4 controller works amazing. It is a far more comfortable controller to use than the Joy-cons.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Switch Aluminum Back Plate Mod" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/switch-aluminum-back-plate-mod">Switch Aluminum Back Plate Mod</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The shell then absorbs much of the heat coming from the CPU and because the back plate is such a large surface, it can cool easily.

You can see the difference in the right photo below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6557_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I don't know why this is different, but you really can't tell in the finished design and it works the same way. I haven't looked into it, but maybe the Chinese version uses the cheaper parts? I don't know.</p><div class='title'><b>Balance Mod</b></div><p>When I built my first bonsai tree, I used a building mod that claimed to make a more balanced tree, and overall it did. The main branch went down the center of the tree, and two other shorter branches were on both sides. I started doing the same mod to this tree. But after building it, I decided to change. Not all trees have the same shape, so I thought it would look more natural if the trees looked different. I took it apart and went with the standard build.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6576_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6582_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The original design (on the right) is really weird. Nature does have a lot of randomness, but there's still a balance to it. However, there is not a stiff coordinated balance like the mod. Maybe there's a nice in-between, but whatever. In the end, it results in a different tree, as you'd expect.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6598_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On its own, the modded balanced tree looks way better just by itself. The unmodified tree on the left feels like it's missing a patch on the right side. But that's okay because it's just one piece of the overall scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Branch Blending</b></div><p>The cherry blossom leaves of the Bonsai Tree and Tranquil Garden are similar, but not the same. Both have white leaves, although they're different pieces. Both use magenta flowers with stud pegs. But for pink flowers, the Bonsai tree uses frogs and the Garden uses stud flowers.</p><p>I wanted all the leaves of the cherry blossom trees to be more uniform, which meant sharing pieces across all of the leaves. The magenta pieces were fine, but the pink pieces were heavy on the Bonsai tree, light on the Garden trees.</p><p>Doing some math, each Bonsai tree has 20 leaves for its tree. The Garden trees have a total of 17. In total, 57 leaves across the three sets. Each Bonsai leaf had 5 frogs, for a total of 200 pink frogs across both sets. That means each leaf should have 3.5 frogs. Each Garden leaf had 4 small flowers, for a total of 58 flower pieces. Easy. Each leaf should have one flower peg.</p><p>I started taking things apart and moving pieces around, and in the end, things looked much better than before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6608_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Garden trees still look a little sparse. But, that's because the leaves are spread apart more than the Bonsai tree. Outside of other mods, you can't really help it.</p><div class='title'><b>Light Kit</b></div><p>When I bought the second Bonsai tree, I also bought a second light kit. Having installed one previously, it was WAYY easier to put together this time. I knew exactly how I was going to hook everything up and it all came together pretty quickly.</p><p>In the end, it came together quite well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230816_lego_etc/IMG_6652_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Both Bonsai trees bookend the Tranquil Garden perfectly and create a scene with the tea house slightly peering through the white and pink branches. I ended up switching the position of the Bonsai trees because of the empty patch of the unmodified tree fits well next to the trees from the Garden.</p><p>It looks great during the day with natural light, and looks great at night with the LEDs flipped on. The photo is a little blown out so it makes the LEDs look brighter than the are, but it looks great in person.</p><p>Perhaps the only problem is how dim the Garden looks compared to the tree. Again, in person, it's not as bad as the photo, but it's still dark. Maybe I'll look into the LED set for that.</p><p>But, I'm really happy how it turned out. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Final Fantasy XVI" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It has an expansive story between kingdoms and magic that spans 20 years with an incredibly satisfying end, but I think it fumbles some aspects that the Final Fantasy franchise prides itself upon.</p><div class='title'><b>The World of Valisthea</b></div><p>Final Fantasy XVI is set on the continents of Valisthea, which is divided between six nations in the beginning. Nations engage in war and alliances between each other to either preserve peace or expand their empire. A ravaging blight that spreads across areas of the continents forces these nations into cooperation or conflict.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp"/></a></p><p>Each kingdom's capital is built at the seat of a towering mother crystal. From mining the crystal, people are able to channel magic used for filling wells with water, or lighting fires used for cooking, etc. </p><p>There is a subset of humans known as bearers who are able to channel magical powers without the aid of crystals. Within the world, the general population considers bearers sub-human and treats them as slaves. Bearers are sold and used as tools for villages and armies and are often abused and lynched by their masters.</p><p>A very few select bearers are more than simple magic users, they are dominants. Dominants can channel divine beings known as Eikons (or Summons, in previous games). These Eikons are the embodiment of a magical alignment and are massive creatures that can easily destroy armies and cities with a single movement.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Only a few dominants are known at the beginning of the story, but there are a total of 8. Many of the kingdoms of Valiesthea have at least one among their ranks. Battles between nation's Eikons are rare as they are considered the nuclear option. If one nation began using its dominant to attack another, that nation would have to respond and would result in extensive losses on both sides. Plus, allied nations would have to respond as well. There is always a thin balance of peace and war.</p><p>Many kingdoms view dominants as divine humans and many dominants are part of the royal bloodline of the ruling class, but others view them as demons. A single human should not have control over power great enough to rip the world apart. One nation, The Iron Kingdom, regards them as abominations and puts any child to death that could possibly become a dominant.</p><p class='img'><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" /><br/>Cloth Map Scan: /ffxvi_cloth_map.png (205.9mb)</a></p></p><p>Overall, this is the world of Final Fantasy XVI at the beginning of the game. The Deluxe Edition of the game came with a cloth map of the world that I scanned and included above. The five mother crystals are pretty easy to see. The castle and capitol of each kingdom lies at the base of the crystal, with the exception of the red crystal to the west. It sits on an island between the Iron Kingdom in the southwest, and Rosaria on the mainland.</p><p>Years ago, there used to be a sixth crystal in the north which had its own kingdom. But the blight engulfed its land destroying the crystal, and completely severing the nation from its resources. All of the brown swaths across the map are areas ravaged by the blight, no longer able to sustain any life.</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>The story of FFXVI focuses on Clive Rosfield, the prince of Rosaria. Clive is the firstborn son of the king, Elwin Rosfield, and has a younger brother, Joshua. Clive attempted the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, but failed, so his mother, Annabella, rejects him for Joshua.</p><p>With the collapse of the northern kingdom, they attempted to invade Rosaria, but failed. To ensure peace with the remains of the north, the Rosfields took the princess, Jill Warrick, as ward. After the complete dissolution of the north, Jill remained in Rosaria and became like a sister to Clive and Joshua. They also have a dog, Torgal.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Story - The Beginning</b></div><p>In the beginning, Clive is a teenager and Joshua and Jill are still children. The Iron Kingdom is moving against Rosaria, so the Duke of Rosaria, Elwin Rosfield, father to Clive and Joshua, moves to attack them. Joshua had successfully completed the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, so Elwin brings him to the battle as a backup plan. Clive is Joshua's sworn Shield (protector), so he goes, too.</p><p>They travel to Phoenix Gate to prepare their battle plans, but their army is secretly attacked and killed in the night. Annabella betrays them and led the rival nation of Sanbreque to their location. Elwin Rosfield is killed, and Joshua awakens as the Phoenix. Another figure appears as awakens as a second Dominant of Fire, Ifrit. They battle, and the Phoenix is killed. Clive is taken by the Sanbreque army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Good</b></div><p>The World and the Story of Final Fantasy XVI are the best aspects of the game. </p><p>The lore has been well thought out, and the general themes of Final Fantasy have been woven into the fabric of that lore. The conflicts between each country and people make sense and build the relationships between all of the characters in the game. The story takes a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones, not only in its world building, but its adult story, too. People are killed in often brutal unexpected methods, including main characters.</p><p>The story is a little complicated, but the game has ample resources for you to keep up with the story and understand what's going on. There are two characters in your hideout that help you with this. One character shows the current political map both from the relationships between characters to the actual world map. Another character writes entries in his library about everything you encounter. Also, during action sequences, you can pull up "active lore" that shows all the information that led to the moment you're experiencing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Story - Continued</b></div><p>13 years pass, and Clive is a slave in the Sanbreque army. He vows revenge against his mother and against the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. During a battle between Dhalmekia and the Iron Kingdom, Clive finds Jill being used by the Iron Kingdom to wage war. He's ordered to kill Jill, but he kills his squad mates and the soldiers holding her captive instead, and they attempt to escape.</p><p>Cid, an outlaw who gives protection to bearers and dominants, finds them and rescues them from the battle. Cid's dream is to create a world where all mankind can be free. No one would keep another as a slave, nor look down on them as being different.  Clive agrees to help Cid find and free more bearers that have been enslaved and used by the kingdoms of Valisthea. </p><p>As they travel, they are attacked by Benedikta, the Dominant of Wind. As they battle, Clive pushes his use of magic passed his limits and transforms into Ifrit to defeat her. Clive realizes that he was the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. After the battle, he accepts what he has done. </p><p>Clive and Jill join Cid's group of outlaws to bring their idea of the peace to the world. Ultimately, in order to accomplish, Cid says that they must destroy the mother crystals. They infiltrate Sanbreque, and destroy their first mother crystal, but (<I>spoiler</I>) Cid is killed in the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With Cid gone, Clive takes the mantle of Cid, and for the next 7 years, they continue to free slaves and help everyone they can. Ultimately, they continue Cid's quest to destroy every mother crystal in Valisthea.</p><div class='title'><b>The Bad</b></div><p>Characters and Story are the backbone of every Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy XVI excels at its expansive, well-thought-out story, but it focuses on a single point, Clive. The whole game revolves around Clive as the central figure responsible for nearly everything that happens in the world. </p><p>In the beginning, it seemed like all the kingdom and characters had agency in how the story and world was shaped.  But, after the second time skip to 20 years after the story began, all the other characters are mostly sitting by, idle, until Clive confronts them on his quest to destroy all the mother crystals.</p><p>The Gameplay is an extension of this as you only ever play as Clive. Perhaps the most controversial change from the Final Fantasy formula was making this more of a single character action game. Final Fantasy used to be the premiere Japanese RPG, where you control a party of characters who excel at magic and weapons. Final Fantasy VII Remake did an excellent job of adding modern action elements while still allowing you control multiple characters and balance your party. In Final Fantasy XVI, you get in a battle and just hack and slash to win. There's a little more than that, but every battle is pretty much the same.</p><p>Because Clive is such a focus in the story and gameplay, other characters get pushed into the background and out of sight. Even if other characters are with you, you almost never really notice. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jill is an amazing character, and watching Clive and Jill's relationship grow over the course of the game is one of the highlights for me. But, once their relationship hits their peak and they admit and express their love for each other, Jill is pushed off to the side. She hangs back on the ship while you go into the next battle.</p><p>While this happens with most other characters in the game, it especially happens with all the women. Because Clive in the main focus of everything in the game, it pushes the masculine attitude that everything in the man's responsibility and everything must be done by the man, which is somewhat troubling given Final Fantasy's history of strong female characters.</p><p>The game does often recognize this, though, as characters will occasionally tell Clive that saving their world is everyone's responsibility, not just his. But, it is brushed off and forgotten as he continues to kill the next boss.</p><div class='title'><b>The Music</b></div><p>Music is another weak part of Final Fantasy XVI.  Final Fantasy prides itself on all of the music through the franchise, and even makes rhythm games to relive classic moments of your favorite games.</p><p>So much of the music from Final Fantasy XVI is forgettable. There are no strong melodic themes between all of the tracks, and often many of the songs are derivative of previous Final Fantasy music. It all sounds like filler music. There's no identity.</p><p>I almost never pay attention to the background music when playing the game. And now listening to the soundtrack on my computer, I find myself skipping many of the songs to try and find something interesting. No one is going to play these songs in Theatrhythm.</p><div class='title'><b>The Graphics, Art, and Performance</b></div><p>Back to the positives, the game looks absolutely stunning and plays like a dream.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The gameplay is pretty repetitive, but there is no point of any input lag between what I'm doing in battle. I'm always able to switch around to the skills that I want to use and evade when an attack is incoming.  Any time I get hit is because of my own screw up. Switching to Performance mode, the game doesn't keep a consistent 60 fps, but it's still quite fluid. Also, loading between scenes takes no more than 2 seconds. It's almost instant between changes map locations or starting a dialogue scene.</p><p>Much of the art direction is excellent, too, with creative and diverse kingdoms with sweeping landscapes. Although, many of the colors are very unsaturated. The world looks very drull and shabby. Many sequences are very dimly lit, too, making everything very dark. This is obviously the image they were going for, and it matches well with the story, but it doesn't make it very scenic. Also, halfway through the game, a spell is cast which darkens the skies and puts a purple hue on everything.</p><div class='title'><b>The End - Ultima</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" /></a></p><p><I>Spoilers</I> After destroying the first mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima reveals himself to you. Ultima is an unworldly mysterious figure who attempts to possess you, but is thwarted by Joshua, who is actually alive. As you take over Cid's quest and destroy crystal after crystal, Ultima's intentions reveal themselves.</p><p>Ultima is of a race of beings that existed long before humanity. The beings all had individual bodies, but shared a single consciousness. Together, they were all known as Ultima.</p><p>In the beginning, Ultima create magic, and with magic, life was created as well. Life flourished throughout the world, but a darkness was also born to balance the forces of nature. This darkness grew, consumed life, and Ultima could not stop its advancement. This was the blight.</p><p>The blight was unstoppable and Ultima had no means of saving their world. So, in order to survive, they had to create a new world where their lives could be born and grown again. To create a new world, they first had to find a land that was pure and untouched by the blight. This was impossible in their physical bodies, so they shed their corporeal forms to become a singular spirit. Then, they were able to find the pure lands of ancient Valisthea, rich in the life force known as Aether.</p><p>Being only spirit, Ultima had to plant the seeds of what they would become. They created the mother crystals in order to collect and channel the aether of Valisthea. And secondly, they created humanity. Over time, as humanity matured, they would be able to harness the power of the aether from the crystals. Each crystal bore a different tribe and different magic. One day, there would a single person who would be able to wield all of the magic. And this would be the person that Ultima had waited for. </p><p>Being able to receive all of the aether inside of himself, Ultima could possess this person and cast a spell that would bring them back to physical life in the world and paradise they had created.</p><p>With the world created, Ultima went to sleep and waited for the day when this person would emerge.</p><div class='title'><b>The End - Humanity</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From humanity's perspective, God had abandoned them. And without God to shape their morality and purpose, man had to find their own purpose. Some men desired power and used magic in order to claim it. Powerful men then led their nations in wars against each other in order to keep and expand their power. And with the overuse of magic, the blight had begun to form in Valisthea. Humanity now had its own purpose and will of their own, and God / Ultima was forgotten. </p><p>After Clive's destruction of the mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima had awaken to see that humanity had spun away from their purpose, his purpose.</p><p>Being able to steal and absorb the magical essence of others, Clive was the person that Ultima was waiting for.</p><p>While Fate had given Clive the ultimate power, it had also given Clive a torturous life of rejection and pain. Ultima needed Clive to give himself completely to Ultima in order for Ultima to become alive again.  But, with every obstacle in Clive's life, every death, every defeat, every failure, Clive continued for himself and the others in his life. </p><p>Humanity was its own being, it was no longer Ultima's to command. Creation of life does not serve as ownership.</p><p>So through the final battle, Clive finally punches God hard enough in the face, and God submits.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Clive absorbs the power from Ultima eradicating him and casts a spell that would remove all magic from the world, which ultimately stops the blight. By casting such a powerful spell, it's implied that Clive uses all the aether from within him and is turned to stone.</p><p>Millenia later, humanity lives on with the lives of Clive, Joshua, and the others becoming stories.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Despite its overall problems, this is the most well told Final Fantasy to date. It has an incredible story and very strong characters of Clive and Ultima. Because of the story, it makes sense that everything is funneled into a singular main character, and that everything is very linear.</p><p>Again, it's unfortunate that many other characters get shuffled off to the side. I think the story probably could have been reworked to give those characters more of a spotlight and perhaps made a party of characters. And having a more traditional party could have resulted in more interesting management of equipment and items.</p><p>But, would the game really have been better as a result? The story probably would have suffered, and they wouldn't have been able to completely tell the story that they wanted.</p><p>It's not perfect, but not every Final Fantasy has to be perfect.</p><p>I think the biggest problem with the previous game, Final Fantasy XV, was not having an overall vision from the beginning and trying to balance too many ideas at once. There was a lot of good with Final Fantasy XV, but that game was broken for a long time, and many of the story sequences are still not quite consistent after all the updates.</p><p>Final Fantasy XVI solved all those problems and created a very specific experience that is technologically sound and fantastic. The lows aren't too bad, and the highs are incredible.</p><p>Overall, I think it's excellent.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/13">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/11">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
