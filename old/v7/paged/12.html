| September 20, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Legend of Crystania is a film that has had a significant impact on me. Unlike any of movie, it wasn't because of the story, characters, art, or music. It was because, 14 years ago, my college friends and I and over 25 members of our college anime club, SPAMM, created a feature length fandub of the film. To this day, I have yet to know anything about the official story or characters other than it's connection to Lodoss War.</p><p>Our film was entitled The Secret of Crystania, and you can view it here: <br/><b><a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">theschlock.com/the-secret-of-crystania</a></b></p><p>Every since moving to Japan, I often go to Yahoo Auctions and when I'm there, I always search for Crystania. Over the last 10 years, many pieces of Crystania memorabilia has surfaced. Usually the prices are very cheap compared to well known anime productions of the time, so buying these things has worked on quite well. Recently, some very interesting things has shown up there, too.</p><p>I have scanned in all of my memorabilia, and you can take a look at it all below.</p><div class='title'><b>Theatrical Run Items</b></div><p>The Legend of Crystania premiered in Japanese theaters during the Tsunogawa Anime Festival on July 29th, 1995. It was part of a double feature along with the Slayers movie. Obviously, Slayers was incredibly popular, so people were basically suckered into seeing Crystania, too.</p><p>I have found a ticket from that event, which has a March 27th, 1995 date on it for some reason. Were they selling tickets that far in advance? Looking around all tickets have that date on them. I don't know why.</p><p>Additionally, I found a flyer for the premiere event as well as a film pamphlet. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As films release in Japan, theaters will sell a pamphlet book of the film with shots from the film, story explanation, and occasionally production notes, interviews, and other behind the scenes stuff. This particular book also has several pages of ads for additional Crystania mechandise. Most of the time these books are sold, but maybe these were given away with the premiere. I've scanned the pamphlet and the flyer and included them below.</p><p>Legend of Crystania - Film Pamphlet (20 pages)<br/><span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span> <span class='ja'>パンフレット</span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/">https://drive.google.com/.../1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm</a></p><p>Slayers / Legend of Crystania Premiere Flyer<br/><span class='ja'>スレイヤーズ</span> <span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span> <span class='ja'>映画</span> <span class='ja'>チラシ</span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/">https://drive.google.com/.../1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy</a></p><div class='title'><b>Home Release Items</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original home release of Legend of Crystania was on VHS in Japan on March 8th, 1996. But, it was a decaying format and LaserDisc was the new hotness. LaserDisc took an incredible hold in Japan and almost all the modern popular anime releases got a LaserDisc release through the late 90s. The LaserDisc version of Crystania was released on March 23rd, 1996, and by the end of the year, the 3-part 6-episode OAV sequel was released on LaserDisc, too.</p><p>The LaserDisc version of Legend of Crystania is the most high quality release to date. In America, we got a DVD version in 2000, but the DVD version released by ADV was a transfer of the LaserDisc. Additionally, the American DVD has subtitles and other English edits burned directly onto the video. This cuts out some of the original video.</p><p>I picked up two copies of the movie as they weren't too expensive.</p><p>The VHS tape shows up on Yahoo Auctions from time to time, but I think it's unnecessary to own since the LaserDisc is the definitive version.</p><div class='title'><b>Animation Cels</b></div><p>Around 7 years ago, as I was looking through Yahoo Auctions, I first searched for Crystania and saw that some was selling animation cels. I had always dreamed or had a fantasy of owning animation cels of Crystania, but owning such things seemed incredible cost prohibited in my mind, considering cels of popular shows go for hundreds of dollars.  </p><p>Luckily, Crystania is not popular, nor even really all that good. I purchased my first cels and posted about it here: <a href="/old/v7/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania" title="/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania">theschlock.com/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania</a>.</p><p>The years went on, and occasionally more and more cels would appear on Yahoo Auctions. Today, I own 15 cels from the film. I have scanned them all, and added them in the gallery below.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Production Collections</b></div><p>Recently, these two items appeared on Yahoo Auctions and I immediately put all of my money behind acquiring them.

| March 27, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There are two major goals of Pokemon as the original theme song of the anime states: (1) <I>To catch them is my real test</I> and (2) <I>To train them is my cause</I>. For many people, battling (number 2) is their most favorite thing about pokemon. They build up their best pokemon, and battle online or battle their friends. Catching every Pokemon in the game (number 1) has always been my real goal.</p><p>In Pokemon games, the Pokedex (perhaps short for Pokemon Rolodex or Pokemon Index) is a complete list of all Pokemon available in the game. Whenever you caught a specie of Pokemon, it is registered in your Pokedex as being caught. When the Pokedex is complete, you have essentially caught every Pokemon in the game. Once complete, you will receive a diploma detailing your accomplishment. :)</p><p>To catch Pokemon, you usually just find them out in the wild. Over time with more and more Pokemon added to the mythos, it no longer became feasible to have every single Pokemon available in the wild. As such, the Pokédexes were split between Regional dexes and the National dex. The National Pokedex is a complete list of all Pokemon, and the Regional Pokedex is the list of all Pokemon available in that particular game.</p><p>If certain Pokemon weren't available in the game, then you would have to either migrate Pokemon from a previous game or trade from another game in the same generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Completing the National Pokedex for the first time</b></div><p>Back in <a href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete" title="/pokedex-nearly-complete">December 2014</a>, I wrote about how I was close to completing my life-long goal of collecting every single Pokemon. In Pokemon White, my National Dex was at 647 out of 649, and for Pokemon X/Y and ORAS, I was at 717 and 716 out of 720.</p><p>A few months later, I was able to catch the few remaining Pokemon I needed.</p><p>In Pokemon White, I bought a used copy of Pokemon Black 2.

Most recently, Generation 8 has begun with the release of Pokemon Sword and Shield in Nov 2019.  As of today, there are 890 total Pokemon across all games. </p><p>Unfortunately, the National Pokedex is being phased out due to the unsustainable amount of Pokemon.

And now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are the first to actually no even allow many Pokemon from previous generations. In both games, you could only complete the Regional dex.</p><p>Not including the National Pokedex in both games completely killed off my enjoyment of those games.

This is an online database where you can store all of your Pokemon. It can be accessed from your Nintendo Switch and from your Phone.

And with currently released Pokemon games on the Switch, you could grab Pokemon from them.</p><p>On the Nintendo 3DS, I began moving Pokemon from Pokemon X and Omega Ruby into Pokemon Bank, and then into Pokemon Sun and Moon and also Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

You could simply sneak up behind them and throw a ball. You could dodge attacks, and move around. When you did battle Pokemon, battles happened right where you were.

It will be performed 5 times in 3 cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.

Plenty of other people were there, too. At 1:30pm, doors open but only a few people were allowed entry at a time. We eventually made it in at 2pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>At the entrance, we gave our reservations to the clerk, and they gave us our tickets. Inside were only a few people, and it was a line for the merch booth that curved around the room. </p><p>My goal was to purchase the concert towel for the event. In Japan, almost every concert or tour has a towel associated with it. It's kind of like a band's tour T-shirt in America. Tell 'em where you've been by buying a towel. The towel was 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> and I bought some stickers, too, for 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>. The tickets included a pamphlet of the concert, so I didn't buy that. Minutes after I purchased the towel, they were sold out, so I was able to get one in the nick of time. :)</p><p>We went back to my car to dump off our stuff, got some lunch, and went right back to the venue for the evening concert.</p><div class='title'><b>The Concert</b></div><p>We probably got back to the venue at 3pm or 3:30pm, and waited in line again. When the doors opened at 4pm, they were letting people in by sequential order of their tickets. Each individual ticket number was checked and let in by the order of when their tickets were purchased. You'd think this would take forever, but it went pretty quickly.  We made it in around 4:30pm, and the show began around 5:15pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The venue was tiny. Capacity was probably 1000 people? (as long as they were all smashed together) WAYYY smaller than the Tokyo or Osaka venues. It was nice, though. Much more intimate.</p><p>The band members took the stage in darkness, tuned their instruments, and the opening sequence for the concert began to play on the screen behind them. The dreamy motions of the title of screen of Chrono Cross. It detailed the preamble of the story.  And then, the heavy reverberations of the guitar being plucked as <b>Scars of Time</b> began, which moved into the light Flute.</p><p>It was incredible. It completely opened up my mind to hearing this music for the first time around 20 years ago when that first trailer dropped on the Internet, and when I imported the game on Playstation.</p><p>Mitsuda quickly introduced himself and the band as they played the opening menu music to the game. As "New Game" was selected, they played the battle music, which is how the game starts.</p><p>Overall, they played through the entirety of the game on the screen, and played the entirety of the soundtrack to accompany it.  I wrote down a rough setlist of what they played:</p><p><u>Main Set</u><br/>	1.	Chrono Cross - Scars of Time<br/>	2.	The Dream that Time Dreams<br/>	3.	Garden of God (Title Screen)<br/>	4.	Between Life and Death (Battle Music)<br/>	5.	Arni Village - Home World<br/>	6.	Arni Village - Another World<br/>	7.	Fields of Time - Home World<br/>	8.	Lizard Dance<br/>	9.	Termina - Another World<br/>	10.	Forest of Illusion<br/>	11.	Viper Mansion<br/>	12.	Gale (Boss Music)<br/>	13.	Victory (A Gift of Spring)<br/>	14.	Guldove - Another World<br/>	15.	Fortress of Ancient Dragons<br/>	16.	A Narrow Space Between Dimensions<br/>	17.	Dead Sea / Tower of Destruction<br/>	18.	Prisoners of Fate<br/>	19.	Magical Dreamers<br/>	20.	Zelbess<br/>	21.	Fate - The God of Destiny<br/>	22. Burning Orphanage??<br/>	23.	The Girl who Stole the Stars<br/>	24.	Frozen Flame<br/>	25.	Dragon God?? (Explanation for Elements. Screwing up, then Game Over)<br/>	26.	A Light for Lost Hopes (Game Over music)<br/>	27.	Life - Distance Promise (Elemental Song)<br/>	28.	Radical Dreamers - Unstolen Jewel<br/>	29.	Fragment of a Dream</p><p><u>Encore</u><br/>	1.	Song to get Mitsuda back on Stage<br/>	2.	Band Members Introduction Song<br/>	3.	Voyage - Another World??<br/>	4.	Voyage - Home World??<br/>	5.	Marbule - Another World</p><p>It wasn't like they just "played" the soundtrack to Chrono Cross. All of these were live variations of the original score. They deviated and mostly improved upon what they had before, and were able to match the crowd's reactions as they played. Much of the concert felt very interactive and Mitsuda explained a lot of his feelings and ideas for each song through the concert.</p><p>As the concert finished, there were credits on the screen, too. I have never been to a concert before with a credits screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Stuff</b></div><p>Concluding the show, this was all the stuff I came away with. I grabbed some of the heart confetti that were shot in the air during the concert, my light stick, and the things that I purchased earlier. Also included is a book of artwork we received as part of our ticket purchase. We also got a flame pendant, too, but that's not pictured here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Again, it was absolutely incredible and a dream come true to see, hear, and feel the music that has shaped my music tastes in video games. It was super dorky to rock out to RPG battle music. It was moving hearing Scars of Time and the other intro song live. And it was fun getting the audience to work together with their colored glowsticks to get the elements in the right order to get the true ending of the game/concert.</p><p>Mitsuda created an amazing concert, and with all of the production that went into the lights and video on display, I understand where the $168 price tag came from.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>With the conclusion of 2 additional final dates in Tokyo, Mitsuda has released an official set list from the concert.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" /></a></p><p>They also made an Apple playlist as well, so you can hear the music from the soundtrack.</p><p><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44" title="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44">https://music.apple.com/.../chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44</a></p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 12th, 2020</I></b></div><p>In a tweet, Mitsuda mentions that the final Nakano performance was recorded, and he is in the process of mastering the audio.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>As part of our ticket purchase, we were to receive a concert booklet of the event. We received an art book, but it was pretty short and didn't include anything about the concert itself. We filled out a card in order to receive this booklet later.</p><p>I got mine in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Calling this thing a booklet doesn't do it justice. In fact, this thing is thicker than most pre-order bonus art books. There are tons of photos from each of the events, interviews, sheet music, and logo designs. Almost all the production that went into planning the concert is included in the book.</p><p>This was BY FAR the most production value I've ever seen packed into a single musical event. In the beginning, it seemed like the concert was a huge expense, but it's clear how much love and care went into the event. Mitsuda clearly loves his music for Chrono Cross as much as his fans, and he loved this experience as much as we did.</p><p>It's an incredible memorial of the event.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - June 24th, 2020</I></b></div><p>This is the concert that keeps on giving. Today, Mitsuda and Procyon Studios released their recording of the final concert in Nakano Plaza.

This cost a total of 14100<span class='ja'>円</span>, which is a lot for a Bluray, but this'll be the very last Mitsuda can ring out of me from the concert. 14100 for the bluray, 16800 for tickets, and 2800 for merch. This totals 33700<span class='ja'>円</span>, or about $337.</p><p>It was totally worth it, though.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - April 15th, 2021</I></b></div><p>The preorder for the Bluray concluded on March 1st, and 6 weeks later, I was finally able to catch my deliveryman and get my Bluray.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It includes a full Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience of the concert with absolutely crisp audio and a full video recording of the event, too.</p><p>Also included is a short pamphlet of photos from the event, and a download code for the arrangement album. This arrangement is okay. I don't think it's as mind-blowing as the actual concert, but it's still a great listen. Much more low-key, too.</p><p>…And now, finally the saga is concluded. An absolutely amazing concert with many ways to relive and cherish those memories.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Happy Death Day" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/happy-death-day">Happy Death Day</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2019 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Happy Death Day is a rare film that blends slasher horror, mystery, and comedy into a well-acted fun film that feels pretty standard or forgettable at first, but stays with you as a fun party movie or hangout movie.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Jessica Rothe</b> portrays Teresa Gelbman, or Tree, as she awakes in an unknown dorm room after a night of heavy drinking and partying. Carter, played by <b>Israel Broussard</b>, brought her here last night, and helps her out before she storms out of the building. Throughout the day, she continues to mean and rude to others, until she is ultimately murdered at night by someone in black with a Baby mask of the school's mascot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Teresa wakes up in the morning again, the same dorm room with Carter. She continues throughout the day as everything had happened before. By the end of the day, she changes her actions to avoid the situation that led to her death. But, she's murdered again in a different way by the same person.</p><p>Thus, the mystery and suspense continues in sometimes unexpected ways as Teresa stumbles into various death scenarios to ultimately find her killer.</p><div class='title'><b>High School Expression Class</b></div><p>Since 2019, I've been using this film in my 1st year Expression classes. This was actually the first film I decided to use, too. Despite being a horror film, it is PG-13. There's no blood or nudity, so it's a very school friendly film, besides the idea of suicide. Here are the full <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course contents</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jessica Rothe is also really great in the film. She puts in all of her efforts in each of her scenes to bring out feelings of tension and mystery. Her acting is very expressive which makes it easy for students to understand her thoughts and feelings without necessarily understanding what is said. Broussard does a pretty good job with this, too, and complements Rothe together as Tree and Carter.</p><p>Another reason that I really like the film is the overall journey Teresa takes from beginning to end. Throughout her adventure, she's able to examine her life and understand how terrible she's been to others. By the end, she's changed into a better person.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the class ends, I mention to students that people often go through life working on one thing to the next without truly examining their life. It's important to think about the kind of person you really want to be, and think about what you can do for yourself and others around you to accomplish your goals and their goals, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Class Contents</b></div><p>You can view the whole list of course contents on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. After watching portions of the film, I have questions for students to answer about the contents. Or, we'll watch a particular scene again and again for listening. For questions, we'll watch the film with English subtitles. For listening, there are no subtitles. Sections of listening are often followed by double-checking the meaning of the dialogue.</p><p>The main fun of the course are the performance tests. Two students will make a pair and perform dialogue together. The full grading criteria is on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. Grading for the performance test is based on the correctness of the spoken dialogue, the expressiveness, and also cooperation between both members because acting isn't something done alone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first performance scene is about 25 minutes in the film between Tree and Lori. Tree has already been killed twice, so she confesses to Lori about what's going on and how she feels. Lori doesn't believe her. In the scene, one student is Tree, and one student is Lori. While performing the dialogue, they should correctly show these emotions through their voice, body movements, and facial movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The second performance test is way more intense. After dying 5 or 6 times, Tree is sent to hospital. The killer is there, too, but Tree escapes in Gregory's car. She's then pulled over and arrested on an empty highway. She thought she had gotten away, but the killer catches up with her and confronts her in the back of the police car. Through frustration, fear, and confusion, she snaps at the killer.

I think their motive makes sense, and the opportunities for her to commit the murders makes sense.

I think her motive makes more sense, but her opportunities do not. Perhaps Stephanie and Lori working together would be best.</p><p>Either way, I feel like Happy Death Day never really got its chance to shine. Nobody really talks about this movie enough.</p><p>There is a sequel, <b>Happy Death Day 2U</b>, but the hard turn from horror into science fiction and a further lean into comedy, which is often too slapstick, probably turned off its audience. A third movie to complete the trilogy is set up at the end, but it was never given the green light. 2U came out in 2019, so the pandemic also helped killed the three-qual.</p><p>Both movies together are pretty fun, and definitely recommended.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hida-Osaka Falls 飛騨小坂の滝" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hida-osaka-falls">Hida-Osaka Falls 飛騨小坂の滝</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The entire Rebuild of Evangelion quadrilogy of films was originally envisioned to be a quick remaster of the original content slowing diverging into a new ending totally finishing Evangelion forever. But, those divergances began early in 2.0, and 3.0 went in a completely different direction than Anno intended in the beginning. Really, both 3.0 and 4.0 are the new ending to Evangelion. Thus, the title 3.0 + 1.0 is more fitting than just 4.0.</p><p>But, Anno had complications on how to truly end the franchise he created and made him famous. He grew up. He no longer saw himself as Shinji, but as Shinji's father, Gendo. He didn't understand Shinji and couldn't think of an ending that made sense. He became depressed from working on this problem too much, and 4.0 laid stale.</p><p>He started working other projects to keep his mind free. He worked with Hayao Miyazaki and Ghibli Film on The Wind Rises. He started finding his joy for filmmaking again, and brought that joy to Shin Godzilla. We renewed interest and the help of staff at Khara, and finally found his way to completing Evangelion.</p><p>And now we're here in 2019, and the first footage of Evangelion Final was shown to the world. The actual event happened at Anime Expo in Paris, but it was telecasted to the world. There were 3 or 4 locations in Japan that picked up the stream are showed it to whoever wanted to attend. Details were exclusively given on the <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/shin_eva_0706/" title="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/shin_eva_0706/">Evangelion Extra</a> app.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9047.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9047.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9047_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9047_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9047_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I went to the location in Nagoya. It was held at the Arsenal shopping mall.</p><p>It was completely open. Anyone could come by and watch. The event started at 8pm, but I arrived around 5pm to get an idea of what was happening. Around 7pm, the screen started showing a loop of highlights from the first 3 movies giving a synopsis of what has happened so far, and a short teaser of where we're going.</p><p>At 8pm, the screen switched to the telecast from Paris. Some of the actors were in attendance and talked about their work on Evangelion and on this final film. Anno was not in attendance, but I think he gave them a short video introducing the clip.</p><p>The synposis played again showing highlights from 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, and then starting interjecting a few new quick shots of 4.0 that have not been shown before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9052_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then, the first 10 minutes of Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 was shown. It showed a destroyed blood soaked Paris, and Misato's crew on a flying battleship hovering above an obelisk in the city. The crew land on the obelisk and try to activate it.</p><p>Then, a swarm of flying enemies spot them and come to fight them. Mari is deployed in her Evangelion, stitched together in crude left over mechanical parts. She fights them and destroys hundreds. In the distance, automated Evangelion units approach in a synchronized march. They siphon their power to a larger unit with a massive mounted cannon. Misato's flying squandron of ships move to defend from the shot. The cannon fires and blasts through them, but the obelisk is saved. Parts of Paris are destroyed in the deflected blasts.</p><p>Mari rips off the Eifel Tower, uses it as a massive spear, and charges at the cannon, but is pulled back by some of the remaining flying enemies. However, she is still able to move and twist around to plunge the Eifel Tower spear into the cannon and destroy it.</p><p>Misato's crew succeeds in unlocking the obelisk, which liberates the old Nerv headquarters in Paris. All of the reserve equipment is available, so they can begin completely repairing their Evangelion units.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9056.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9056_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9056_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190706_eva/IMG_9056_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The clip ends and everyone cheers.</p><p>It's pretty funny how the presenter was talking about how much the development staff of Evangelion 3.0+1.0 loves Paris and used Paris as an inspiration, but the movie completely trashes the city and rips apart the Eifel Tower to use as a weapon.</p><p>The presentation is concluded, and that's the end of the event.</p><p>Evangelion 3.0+1.0 was expected to be released in 2020, but the release was canceled because of the coronavirus. It was eventually finally release in March 2021.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Apr 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Games Mosiac (Top 18)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-games-mosaic">Favorite Games Mosiac (Top 18)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Everything feels fully realized as much as a Star Trek or a Star War.</p><p>The story falls apart a bit in 3, which has all but killed the franchise, but there's still hope for the future.

Katamari Damacy (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>The Katamari series of games ooze joy. You start off tiny, roll your ball around to pick up stuff, and get bigger and bigger until eventually rolling up the entire world. It's goofy, sure. But the overall atmosphere of Katamari it's super uplifting boosted by its quirky and fun soundtrack.</p><p>I instantly fell in love with the first game. The sequel, We Love Katamari, added new maps and new methods of completing maps. Hard to do, but its soundtrack out shines the original.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/katamari.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/katamari.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/katamari.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Later released was Katamari Forever, which had a unique story but collected levels from all released games. I really wish this was available on modern consoles.</p><div class='title'><b>7. Final Fantasy (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>I have been a long fan of Final Fantasy. I skipped the original on NES, but picked up Final Fantasy IV on the Super Nintendo. I was one of the first games I played that had an expansive story where characters actually changed and grew. Final Fantasy VI didn't have the same impact on me as others, but I grew to appreciate it.</p><p>The Playstation Trilogy is where I was in constant awe of the story, of the environments, and of the characters. I played so much Final Fantasy VII and the remake is incredible.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/finalfantasy.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/finalfantasy.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/finalfantasy.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Almost all classic series from the NES era that have continued today have had growing pains trying to adapt their original simplistic model to each modern era of gaming. As such, I skipped much of the games past Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy XV really pulled me back in, though.</p><p>Every game is different in the Final Fantasy series, and none of them have connecting stories. Rather than individually rank each game, I did a tier list of my favorites.</p><p>S Tier - 7 / 7R / 8 / 6 / Tactics / 15 / 4<br/>A Tier - 10 / 12 / 9<br/>Whatever Tier - 11 / 1 / 2 / 3<br/>Don’t Know Tier - 5 / 13 / 14</p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: Final Fantasy XVI comes out soon and looks to be an absolute solid game having learned from the mistakes of XV.</p><div class='title'><b>6. The Legend of Zelda (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>One of the key aspects of The Legend of Zelda has been exploration. Starting the game with the whole world in front of you, looking at all the small details in the land, and find secret caves and treasure. Each cave or dungeon always has a series of puzzle mechanics you must figure out in order to progress. It brings out the curiousness, creativity, and ingenuity of those that play it.</p><p>Much like Final Fantasy, the Zelda series of games have also grown up along with the game industry. But Nintendo takes its time to fully realize their vision for each game, and rarely does that vision ever fail.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The original Legend of Zelda was too much for me as a kid, and Zelda was too hard. A Link to the Past was absolutely perfect. The environments, the music, the dungeons, and items and puzzles. You always felt like that progress you made was an accomplishment. Ocarina of Time fully realized that vision in 3D, though it has aged a lot. Twilight Princess modernized that vision.</p><p>Having fully realized their vision, they tried to innovate with divisive results. They released a direct sequel to A Link to the Past entitled A Link Between Worlds, which opened up the world. No longer did you have to follow a linear story path from dungeon to dungeon. With people used to the idea, Breath of the Wild fully realized their direction for the future while still holding true to the past. A complete open world where exploration unveils the story and many other secrets.</p><p>Below is my tier list of Zelda games. I'm very traditional when it comes to Zelda, so I don't think the results are much of a surprise.</p><p>GOAT Tier - A Link to the Past, Breath of the Wild<br/>S Tier - Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, A Link Between Worlds.<br/>A Tier - Wind Waker, Minish Cap<br/>B Tier - Skyward Sword<br/>— others</p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: The follow-up to Breath of the Wild entitled The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is an absolute masterpiece of exploration, story, and innovation through gameplay. It's hard to think of a game dethroning Wild, but it is better in every way. It stands alongside A Link to the Past as the Greatest Of All Time for me.</p><div class='title'><b>5. Rez</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>When I first saw online previews of the Japanese release, I knew that I had to get a copy of Rez. It looked unlike any other game released at the time. It was an abstract vision of a person moving through colors and shooting down things. I bought one of three copies that my local Funcoland received on release day, and I became fully immersed in the sights and sounds of Rez.</p><p>Rez was like no other game at the time, and like no other game since.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/rez.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/rez.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/rez.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The visual movements are a reaction to the adaptive soundtrack. As the background sounds move and thump, your actions all execute in sync with the music. You float through the world as an abstract expression of hacking a computer mainframe to rescue code which will save the consciousness of humanity.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Tetris</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>Tetris may be the most perfect game of all time. Its expert design has stood for nearly 40 years since its creation. Many parodies have come and gone, but Tetris always remains with few iterations.</p><p>The original Gameboy release was one I played for many hours. Later, Tetris DS released and became the definite version of Tetris. The movements were pixel perfect with no lag, pieces could be moved on the ground before being placed, and you could store pieces. All of the modern updates were included and felt amazing.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/tetris.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/tetris.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/tetris.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: These days, I think Tetris DS has been outshined by the indie release of Apotris for the Gameboy Advance. Extremely tight controls and includes Zoning and Perfectrises adding from Tetris Effect. Unfortunately, it's been DMCA'd by the Tetris Company, so you can no longer buy it.</p><div class='title'><b>3. Dance Dance Revolution (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>DDR is a game series that has now been lost to time. The rhythm game genre and arcade have moved on from the simple steps. But it will always hold a significant place in my heart.</p><p>DDR taught me the importance of exercise and how it's really not all that difficult to lose weight as long as you work at it each day. By playing DDR in college, at gaming events, random arcades, and other places both in American and Japan, I had met a lot of people and made friends. Some of whom I'm still friends with after a long time.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/ddr.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/ddr.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/ddr.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Many of the songs in the game were uplifting, and the button presses matches the movements you would do if you were just grooving to the tunes. It was fun to feel like you've become part of the music, and building a community around those songs and a physical space were some of the best parts of my college experience. </p><p>Those days are behind me now, but I always use music when doing exercise these days, and the movements and power I get from the music always pushes me further.</p><p>These are the best home releases of Dance Dance Revolution:</p><p>Playstation 2: DDR Max (USA), DDR Max 2 (Japan), DDR Party Collection, DDR Extreme (USA)<br/>Playstation 1: DDR 5th Mix (Japan), DDR 3rd Mix (Japan)</p><div class='title'><b>2. Pokemon (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>Pokemon is my brand. Almost all of the games on this list have consumed my life at certain points of time, but no series is ever present in my head than Pokemon. Pokemon is always evolving and always has something new going on for better or worse.</p><p>I first played Pokemon Blue back in the day, and came back to the series later with Pokemon Emerald and Fire Red. Since then, I've bought and played each main game release ever building to my goal of completing the Pokedex. I finally completed this goal in 2016 with Generation 6.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/pokemon.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/pokemon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/pokemon.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Also, in 2016, Pokemon Go was released for phones. It was fun at the time, but got boring. In 2018 I came back, and became something that I use on a daily basis. I love exploration in games, and Pokemon Go had me exploring my town in real life, driving to physical waypoints to meet up with other people and play together. I've met tons of people around town and at events as well as made plenty of online friends, too.</p><p>As the pandemic had many people locked down in the homes, I began streaming Pokemon on Twitch with Let's Go Eevee. A lot of students and young folk began watching me try to collect all of the shiny variants in the game. It became an incredible social experience that brought me back into programming and building an online community.</p><p>Much like DDR, it's fair to say that Pokemon has changed my life, and it often inspires me to do creative works around it.</p><p>I did two inner lists for Pokemon. First, was a ranking of each Generation of Pokemon. Even though I started with Kanto, I think Hoenn was what really got me back into Pokemon.</p><p>Gen 3 > 5 > 1 > 9 > 6 >> 4 > 8 > 7 > 2</p><p>I also did a tier list for each of the individual Pokemon games. <I>Update 2023</I>: I added all the games recently released to these lists.</p><p>S Tier : Emerald / HeartGold SoulSilver / Black White / OmegaRuby AlphaSapphire / Legends<br/>A+ Tier: New Snap / FireRed LeafGreen / Platnium / Let's Go Pikachu Eevee<br/>A Tier : Go / Conquest / Black White 2  / Scarlet Violet<br/>B+ Tier: Snap / Red Blue / Diamond Pearl / Sun Moon<br/>B Tier : Gold Silver Crystal / Ruby Sapphire / Ultra Sun Moon / Sword Shield<br/>C Tier : Yellow / XY<br/>F Tier : BrilliantDiamond ShiningPearl<br/>— others</p><div class='title'><b>1. Snatcher</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>Snatcher has been at the top of my list of favorite games forever. I think some other games have changed my life more and hold more meaning, but Snatcher will always have a place in my heart.</p><p>Going from Mario, Zelda, and even Final Fantasy, the characters of Snatcher felt real, had distinct motivations, thoughts, and feelings opened my eyes to the potential of storytelling through games. As the overall mystery is uncovered, characters change and motivations make sense. It was the first game I played where death actually had meaning.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Snatcher uses both Blade Runner and Terminator to create a unique story of killer robots, Snatchers, killing and impersonating people. You play as Gillian Seed who had lost his memory and joined the Junkers, a police division which specializes in hunting down the Snatchers. Ultimately, the plot is uncovered and Gillian Seed gets more answers to his past. </p><p>Snatcher was Hideo Kojima’s second game as a sole director. The Sega CD version was the one I played back in the day. It was released in 1994 and was the 4th iteration having prior been released on PC-8801 (1988), MSX (1988), and Turbo CD (1992). This was the only American release, and it was complete with English voice acting and cutscenes. </p><p>The music is very futuristic 90s synthwave that matches the grimey, dirty, and metallic feeling of Neo Kobe City. As the story builds, the music builds with it. It was one of the first games I played where the music set a tense mood and atmosphere rather than just being background music. Snatcher’s sound and music was written and arranged by Akira Yamaoka. This was one of his first games, too. Later on, he would curate and write music for DDR, and ultimately move on to create the Silent Hill series.</p><p>I will always love Snatcher, and I don’t think I’ll ever knock it off my No. 1 position as my favorite game of all time.</p><div class='title'><b>My Favorite Games</b></div><p>As you can see from my list, my favorite games tend to be the ones that allow exploration of a massive world, have a compelling story with unique and distinct characters, and have a unique and memorable soundtrack that accurately compliments the setting, the gameplay, or the story. I tend to value those aspects over the actual gameplay.</p><p>It’s interesting to see how my favorites list has changed over the last few decades. You can view my list from 2007 below. Over time, I can’t really see this list changing much more. I think the top entries are pretty much set.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock">Schlock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 30, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 20 years ago, when I was in high school, there was a show on the Sci Fi Channel called Trailer Park.  It was 30 minutes long, and only showed movie trailers.  Mostly trailers for new movies, but some old ones, too.</p><p>One such episode featured a movie called Schlock<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY</a></p><p>It was one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, hilarious-not-hilarious, trying-too-hard things I'd ever seen at that point.  Over the next few years, I searched around pawn stores, video stores, and old rental stores trying to find a copy of it on VHS, but it seemed like no one even heard of it.<br/>The name was pretty unique, so I used it as my screen name for AOL and everything else since.</p><p>In October 2001, it was finally released on DVD, and on my birthday that year, I was finally able to see it.  I had a bunch of people over to my dorm room, both friends from MN and college.</p><p>It didn't necessarily live up to my expectations, but I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, there were some pretty great moments in the film.  I don't really think any of my friends had quite the reactions I did.</p><p>For the last 17 years, the Schlock DVD had become quite scarce.  I think 10 years ago, the DVDs were going for the same price they are now, $150.</p><p>But now, once again in my birthday month, Schlock has been released again, now on Bluray, and in a rather nice package.  The booklet had a story about how John Landis scrapped together what he had to make it.  There's a reversible cover.  The movie is a 4k restoration.  There's a few commentary tracks.  New interviews.  Old TV spots, and other things.  It's the complete Schlock package.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a week late, but now I have a new version of Schlock near my birthday, and new people to show this awful movie to.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/13">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/11">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
