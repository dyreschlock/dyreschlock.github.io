| April 19, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Weekend on April 10th, Video Games Live performed in Minneapolis for their first time.  Video Games Live is headlined by seasoned video game music composers Tommy Tallarico and Jack Wall who bring their compositions of popular video game franchises to your "local" orchestra and perform them.</p><p>This concert is meant to be a celebration of video games and game music.  Tallarico and Wall said that their mission with Video Games Live was to show all generations the legitimacy of games and how they've changes our lives and culture.  And it was a celebration.  This concert attracted all flavors of game enthusiasts from children and families to hipsters to hardcore gamers to casual gamers and to nerds and geeks in general.  There was a wide variety of cliques and cultures in the audience which is really proved their point.  Video Games aren't for some niche demographic, they're for everyone to enjoy.  It was neat to see everyone join together in harmony.</p><p>Here's the set list from the evening:</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. Metal Gear Solid<br/>3. God of War<br/>4. Space Invaders Demonstration<br/>5. History of Video Games<br/>6. Kingdom Hearts<br/>7. Martin Leung performs "Final Fantasy"<br/>8. The Legend of Zelda<br/>Intermission<br/>9. World of Warcraft<br/>10. Super Mario Brothers<br/>11. Martin Leung performs "Super Mario Brothers" while blindfolded<br/>12. Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross<br/>13. Guitar Hero "Van Halen - Jump"<br/>14. Halo<br/>Encore<br/>1. One Winged Angel - Final Fantasy VII<br/>2. Castlevania</p><p>Also, I recorded the whole thing since I chose seats with a perfect vantage point. I wonder if they'll try to kill this...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/p/081C172EE2492354&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/p/081C172EE2492354&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>Video Games Live v. Distant Worlds</b></div><p>Video Games Live is strikingly similar to another video game themed 'concert' I've been to before entitled Distant Worlds.  Distant Worlds is a concert featuring music solely from Final Fantasy and created by primary Final Fantasy Composer Nobuo Uematsu.  Uematsu has been in charge of music in Final Fantasy since the beginning, and his concerts aren't really so much a celebration of Final Fantasy, but revisiting the music and compassion that made these games so memorable.</p><p>That's really the true division between Video Games Live and Distant Worlds.  Video Games Live's music simply represents a game.  Comparing Video Games Live and Distant Worlds is like comparing the question "Dude, do you remember Super Mario Brothers?" to the question "Do you remember how you felt when Yuna performed her dance for the souls of everyone in her camp?" (or whatever).  Yeah yeah, Super Mario Brothers NES doesn't lend itself well for emotion memorable experiences, but VGL performs music from other games that are such as Legend of Zelda and Metal Gear Solid.  Their performances didn't really engage me with the same emotion and life as any Final Fantasy song performed at Distant Worlds.</p><p>I think the real difference boils down to Video Games Live simply being a cover band.  That's not meant as an insult, but I think their songs are missing what made these games good and memorable to begin with.  In some cases the most memorable parts of these games was not the music.  Like World of Warcraft?  Does that game even have music? And in other cases where the games have a clear memorable melody, it's not best expressed with an orchestra.  Like Guitar Hero with an Orchestra?!  Halo?  In both cases, Tallarico is using an electric guitar.  Yeah, that fits in an orchestra setting.  Though, their Castlevania song is pretty bitchin'</p><p>I think Distant Worlds is a much better performance because the songs are meant to capture and emphasize those emotional experiences, they same way any classic song should.  And with the original composes, Nobou Uematsu, behind it all, he ensures that the essence of the song is in tact and more powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of which...</b></div><p>Distant Worlds started back in 2008 and is still roaming the globe.  I saw them on March 1st 2008 on their first visit to Chicago.  They've already been back through there again.  Probably because it sold out immediately the first time.  They're coming through Chicago for a third time on August 1st, 2010 and tickets go on sale this Thursday.  This time they're performing at Ravina, wherever that is.</p><p><a href="http://ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=details&amp;id=26:ravinia-august-1-2010&amp;Itemid=62" title="http://ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=details&amp;id=26:ravinia-august-1-2010&amp;Itemid=62">Distant Worlds Link</a> - <a href="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=139" title="http://www.ravinia.org/ViewDate.aspx?show=139">Ravina Link</a></p><p>Huzzah!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Starcraft II Collector's Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition">Starcraft II Collector's Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning Blizzard announced its pricing and release details for Starcraft II.  One would say Starcraft II its Blizzard's most anticipated game of ALL TIME, given the success and timeless qualities of Starcraft I.  Blizzard announced the regular retail version at $60, and the Collector's Edition at $100.  Here's a news article from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-starcraft-ii-collector-s-edition-170358.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-starcraft-ii-collector-s-edition-170358.phtml">Destructoid</a>.  Included in the Collector's Edition is an artbook, a comic, a WOW pet, some exclusive profiles for Starcraft II and a fancy USB stick with Starcraft I and its expansion.</p><p>Alone, I think the Collector's Edition is well worth the $100, especially since I no longer have my copy of Starcraft I.  But, given the history of Blizzard's Collector Editions, I would expect this one to sky rocket in value.  OK, so the Burning Crusade Collector's Edition isn't so hot, but sealed copies of the original World of Warcraft Collector's Edition go for over $1000 on ebay.  (<a href="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition+new&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_odkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition&amp;_osacat=0&amp;bkBtn=" title="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition+new&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_odkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition&amp;_osacat=0&amp;bkBtn=">source</a>)</p><p>In addition, people have been selling Beta Keys for Starcraft II on ebay for anywhere between $100 and $200. (<a href="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=starcraft%20ii%20beta&amp;_fln=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&amp;_rdc=1" title="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=starcraft%20ii%20beta&amp;_fln=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&amp;_rdc=1">source</a>)  $200 for a game that you can only for another couple of months!</p><p>Collecting for the purpose of selling is always a gamble, but I bet you could easily sell a sealed copy of Starcraft II Collector's Edition for twice its value after the release of the game.  If you bought two, the game would pay for itself!  The Collector's Edition is up on amazon now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starcraft-II-Wings-Liberty-Collector-2019s-Pc/dp/B002I0JMB8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1270749861&amp;sr=8-6" title="http://www.amazon.com/Starcraft-II-Wings-Liberty-Collector-2019s-Pc/dp/B002I0JMB8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1270749861&amp;sr=8-6">link</a>).  I pre-ordered a single copy for myself, but I'm terribly tempted to buy a second.</p><p>Anyways, those are my evil thoughts on the subject.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-awakening">The Spring Awakening @ Congress Theater</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Spring Awakening 2010 was the last one night event, they did before skipping 2011, and having the 2-day festival in 2012.  More on that one here: <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">July 21st, 2012</a>.</p><p>The Headlining lineup for 2010 was <b>Above & Beyond</b>, <b>Benny Benassi</b>, and <b>Second Sun</b> (Live).</p><p>Five and I went there together.  We arrived as opener <b>DJ BeBe</b> was finishing his set.  <b>Erik K</b> took over the opening duties soon after.  Both were fantastic openers. :)</p><p><b>Second Sun</b> were next, and they performed a great live set of their songs.  <b>Benny Benassi</b> was next.  I had not heard his music prior to the night.  He played some rather interesting tracks that really set his set apart from anything I had heard before.  Crazy drops and breaks in the atmosphere.</p><p>But, after seeing them in 2009, I was super excited to see <b>Above & Beyond</b>, and also introduce them to Five. :)  I felt like their 2009 performance at Epic was much more "magical".  At Epic, they felt much more connected to the crowd.  The Congress was just way too big to make that connection.  But they still were fantastic.  Here are thoughts on that event: <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">November 23rd, 2009</a>.</p><p><br/>Here are videos I took of the whole evening: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFAB4D2A2E2738F6</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/paul-oakenfold-epic-minneapois">Paul Oakenfold @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This night was a really great throwback.  Before Paul Oakenfold took the stage, Jack Trash addressed the crowd and talked about The Quest.  </p><p>"Do any of you remember the last time Paul Oakenfold was here?  It was in 2004, back when this place was The Quest.  It was dank, and dirty."</p><p>Aww, The Quest wasn't that bad. :/  But, I definitely remember.

| February 2, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The other night, Conan O'Brien visited my dreams.  It was a semi-normal dream for me.  Some friends and I went to some event at a movie studio.  The event was a tribute to Conan O'Brien that showed his legacy on Late Night.  It took place in a parking lot type area.  There were only about 30 of us, and we all sat in desks, like in a classroom.  I sat near the projector, which was also near the speaker, which was somewhat in the middle of all the desks.</p><p>We watched some clips, introduced some acts, and the speaker started playing a piano as Conan O'Brien showed up and started his speech.  In the middle of the speech/musical act, he hopped on the piano bench and tried to play, but could not.  Eventually the original speaker took over, and Conan sat in a desk in front of me.</p><p>He murmured something like, "I guess I should've learned the piano before trying to play."  I mentioned something like, "That's ok.  I don't know how to play either.  Though, I've always wanted to."  To which he retorted, <em>"Well, if you want to play the piano, you should buy one and start playing."</em></p><p>That's about where the dream ended for me.  I woke up with the phrase "Buy a Piano" echoing in my head.  It really reminded me of that episode of Futurama when advertisers implanted product placement in Fry's dreams.  Which WILL happen someday...</p><p>I do want to learn the Piano, but I think there's other things I've already started learning I should specialize in first, such as other facets of Software Development and Japanese Language.  I should probably return to Drawing at some point too...  But music is very much a part of my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Korg DS-10</b></div><p>I really don't have the money or room to buy an actual Piano, but I do already own a music instrument of sorts.  Almost one year ago, XSeed released <b>Korg DS-10</b> in the states, which was originally released in Japan on July 27th, 2008.  Korg is the world leader in synthesizers, but those are pretty expensive and sometimes huge.</p><p>Korg DS-10 is 'software' for your Nintendo DS that mimics the basic functionality of a synthesizer.  It gives you two synth tracks, four drum tracks, and plenty of FX and fades to mix them together, along with a song timeline to bring everything together and actually compose music.</p><p>Thanks to Conan's advice, I actually played around with it for a substantial amount of time last night.  I got the feel of how all the synths and drum synths are laid out, how they interact, and how everything comes together.</p><p>I am an extreme novice when it comes to actually making the music, and everything I did always had the exact same sound.  I tried changing the demo song to be more ambient, but everything I did still kept it in the realm of techno.  Ya know, the whole "unce unce unce" feel.</p><p>Techno is just fine.  Personally, I had a hard time getting away from the demo song (again, I'm a novice), but other people have made some pretty fun songs.</p><p>Such as Jetdaisuke's Express #471:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vty4pMfJkZ4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vty4pMfJkZ4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"> </embed></object></p><p>Also, the Demo videos on youtube are pretty good too:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bQcp2Mkt_-A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bQcp2Mkt_-A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>It's kinda simple...</b></div><p>Many of the other songs I came across all follow this style of music, but I want something ambient, progressive, and maybe a little trance, which is the style of Electronica I adore.  Or at least something more complex.</p><p>The third demo video gets closer to this:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vmIwZDVJSwI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vmIwZDVJSwI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>But, as the video demonstrates, it requires more than the 2 synths and 4 drums on the single Korg DS-10 cart.  You can cluster up to 4 Nintendo DSes and Korg DS-10s for a total of 8 synths and 16 drums, but that's a bit much to spend.  (Especially in Japan where Korg DS-10 was only available through Amazon.co.jp and cost $50 each).</p><div class='title'><b>Korg DS-10 Plus</b></div><p>A year after Korg DS-10 was released in Japan, AGI released Korg DS-10 Plus, which made use out of the recently released Nintendo DSi.  You could still get the same functionality from DS-10 Plus if you used it on a DS, but with the DSi, you effectively doubled your processing power and functionality.</p><p>With the DSi, Korg DS-10 Plus has 4 synths, and 8 drums.  Plus, you can edit your composition while playing in Song mode, which you couldn't do previously.  Korg DS-10 Plus is like having two regular DS-10s in one.</p><p>This really branches the synthesizer into more complex songs with a single cart:</p><p>Such as Magomusume's Mago_004:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/crax4GSIgR0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/crax4GSIgR0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>And S_Ishimaru's Millenium:</p><p><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Lx4r1ro15eg&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Lx4r1ro15eg&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>February 16th!</b></div><p>Korg DS-10 Plus comes out in America in a mere two weeks!  Unlike the release of DS-10, XSeed is planning for a much wider distribution for DS-10 Plus, so you might be able to find it at Best Buy and Wal*mart.  It has all the functionality of the original, with twice the amount of functionality for DSi owners.</p><p>It's not a piano, but it's definitely something.  And it's the cheapest and most portable synthesizer you'll ever buy. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to I think about video games too much" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/i-think-about-video-games-too-much">I think about video games too much</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 25, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>With the anticipated release of Mass Effect 2 only hours away, I found myself thinking about it on the way home.  I was trying to think of a way I could scam Gamestop out of a DLC code for their <em>exclusive</em> weapons and armor.  I don't actually care about having the items in the game, but I kinda want that DLC card to complete my edition.</p><p>I had already preordered Mass Effect 2 Collector's Edition months ago on Amazon.  Plus, I bought a preorder at Best Buy, so I could get their <em>exclusive</em> armor.</p><div class='title'><b>Wait!</b></div><p>But then I thought, "Didn't I order Mass Effect 2 with release day shipping from Amazon?  Shouldn't that have shipped already?  Shouldn't I have gotten an email about it?"  Way back when the Collector's Edition first appeared on amazon I didn't instantly buy it.  I was waiting for the ECA to release more Amazon discount codes, or waiting for a discounted Amazon price, rather than the full $70.  I thought, "Did I actually forget to go back and actually buy it?  Did I never actually order it?"</p><p>I was on my way to Gamestop, anyways.  I wanted that DLC card.  And, as a consolation, I was going to Preorder Yakuza 3 since Gamestop has <em>exclusive</em> DLC for that, too.  Ugh.</p><p>When I parked my car, I brought up Amazon on my iPhone and checked my open orders and there was <b><em>nothing!</em></b> I saw no order for Mass Effect, or any history of ever buying it.  Whoops.</p><div class='title'><b>Scavenger Mode</b></div><p>The game comes out tomorrow and I don't actually have a Collector's Edition spoken for.  So, I tried "preordering" at Gamestop since I was there.  Typically, Gamestop will only let you preorder games up until the week before its release.  They won't let you preorder a game that comes out the next day because they already have all their copies in stock.  You'd essentially be buying someone else's copy.  Which would be the same if anywhere let me preorder it at this point.</p><p>But I thought, "eh, fuck it.  Perhaps the employees aren't keen on this fact."  Unfortunately they were keen.  And, in addition, Gamestop discontinued the preorder of Mass Effect 2 Collector's Edition a mere 3 weeks after its availability in the system.  I just stuck with my preorder of <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=76648" title="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=76648">Yakuza 3</a>.</p><p>Best Buy was taking preorders, so that was my next stop.  Even though, I had already preordered the game through Best Buy, I was pretty sure it was the regular edition I laid out $5 for.  I checked the place to see if they were stupid enough to leave out all their preorder boxes, and they were not.  All the boxes had been removed from the shelf.</p><p>In fact, now that I'm at home, I actually preordered the PC version by mistake.  At the time I bought it, they must've already removed all their boxes for the Xbox 360 version.  Which would go along with Gamestop's story of only preordering the game for 3 weeks.</p><p>I stopped off at Toys R Us to see if they were offering preorders.  They would definitely be ignorant to the point of forgetting something like that.  But they were not offering.</p><div class='title'><b>Internet</b></div><p>Unfortunately, those were really my only choices to turn to in the real world.  I don't think any other retailer in Madison would carry the Collector's Edition; let alone, not be knowledgeable enough for me to prey on.  So, the Internet is my final recluse.</p><p>Amazon no longer accepts orders.  Though, some sellers have theirs available for $110.  Best Buy dot Com has no availability.  GameStop dot Com doesn't accept my credit card anymore.  Plus, they're out too.  Doing a Shopping Search on Google gives retailers who are either sold out, or very shady.</p><p>There's a bunch of dudes on eBay selling their copies, and one particular dude selling his for $90 w/ free shipping.  An extra $20 isn't TOOO bad.  Plus, I sold the Collector's Edition DLC from Dragon Age for $40.  I could probably do the same and walk away with a $50 game.  Eh, fuck it.  I've wasted more money on less before.  Besides, my Paypal Account has enough money to cover the whole thing.</p><p>Cha-ching.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Investigation</b></div><p>After being in my head for this whole venture, which lasted about an hour, I went back to Amazon dot Com (this time on my computer).  I went around in my order explorer and actually <b>found</b> my order for Mass Effect 2.  Apparently it didn't show up in my future or past orders because it's in the "now shipping" order queue.  It can't be changed or modified because they're currently putting it together to ship.</p><p>The estimated arrival date is January 26th, though.  I don't know how they plan on getting that package to my apartment tomorrow, if they're still busy putting it in a box, right now.</p><p>As a result of all this nonsense, I find myself with an extra copy of the Collector's Edition.  I'll probably just turn around and put it back on eBay.  Someone will probably buy it for $100.</p><p>Still no DLC card from Gamestop. :/</p><p>I think I need something better to do with my evenings...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Music in Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/music-in-madison">Music in Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 25, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the past week, I've been to a couple music events in Madison that were pretty fun.  I love living in a town where all the great venues, bars, and other attractions are all in one small area.  A town large enough to foster, nurture, and bring in some amazing talent.  Yet, small enough that I can get anywhere in 30 minutes at most. ^_^  Especially when it's January and the weather is horrible.</p><p><b>Dustin Zahn @ High Noon</b> // Jan 15th</p><p>Last weekend, we caught word of some amazing music at the High Noon and stopped there for the evening.  The air was filled with an amazing energy of raw techno, house and a little electro.  Dustin Zahn kept the crowd moving all night long.  It was one of the best nights I've had in Madison.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v9HdtyPlDEM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v9HdtyPlDEM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"> </embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/arEZg4aH40k&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/arEZg4aH40k&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Rez!</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MHDEVO1HcYE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MHDEVO1HcYE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Dustin Zahn hails from Minneapolis, which explains a lot.  The whole night gave off the vibe of a mid-90s rave.  The kind that were prevalent in niche corners of the USA, and especially in Minneapolis.  The Minneapolis rave scene gave birth to the amazing talent and fans that surge in Minneapolis today.  Last weekend was a glimpse into that pure energy.</p><p><b>Holy F*ck @ Majestic</b> // Jan 22nd</p><p>This weekend, Madison played host to Toronto's "must-see live act" Holy Fuck.  Apparently, these guys have "redefined" what it means to give a live performance by using their raw common-sense genius to build up new songs and sounds that make every one of their shows unique.</p><p>Unfortunately...  they conducted a DJ set.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fzMuLePLx58&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/84PVEYey4H8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>They played some pretty awesome songs.  And after hearing what I recorded, some of the other songs sound pretty good too.  But, they came at the tail end of a horrible performance by a DJ duo known as the Fun Cartel.</p><p>The Fun Cartel are two guys with opposing musical tastes and skill.  The skinny afro guy was pretty cool.  But his sidekick would throw in tracks that completely ruined the vibe.  In addition, they failed almost each one of their transitions.  In the end, their set felt like a 3 year old's finger painting.  "Let's just throw in all of our favorite songs.  Orange mixes with Blue, right?!"  Ugh..</p><p>Also, our dinner plans for the evening didn't go so hot either.</p><p><b>Erebus @ The Annex</b> // Jan 23rd</p><p>Erebus is not in my realm of music.  They are Metal.  And while their music is definitely different than mine, metal fans could not love their music more.  Metal fans are born to rock, congregate, and mosh together.  Erebus does an amazing job of channeling that passion, energy and fandom into something that anyone with a strong passion for music can love.</p><p>Examples:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EJTsfkXqEDw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jMknhpY2hHE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>Even though there were probably 30 people or less in attendance, Erebus performed with such enthusiasm and attention that everything they did on stage was clearly meant for us.  We were the reason they were on stage.  The songs they chose, the monologues spoken.. it was all for us.  And the true fans reciprocated by doing what Metal fans do:  Hopping off the stage, slamming into each other, head bangin', and truly rockin' out.</p><p>I've seen them a couple times before, but this was truly their best night, in my opinion.  Though, I might be semi-biased.  Erebus' lead members are Dave and Gage.  Gage is one of my good friends in Madison.  We met at Widen back when we were both interns.  I first saw them perform live almost exactly 3 years ago, when they first performed live themselves (<a href="/old/v7/erebus-first-show" title="/erebus-first-show">here</a>).</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways</b></div><p>Anyways, Madison is pretty amazing.  Great music at a small scale. Daedelus is coming to town in 3 weeks! King Cannibal in 2.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Spring is the new Fall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-is-the-new-fall">Spring is the new Fall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 19, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As I peer over at my library of video games, there are very few that I have purchased that were released in 2009.  I bought a couple games such as Retro Game Challenge, KORG DS-10, Pokemon Platinum, Street Fighter IV, Katamari Forever, Dragon Age, Raiden IV, and Metroid Prime Trilogy but that's really it.  There were only 8 games from last year that I felt were worth owning.</p><p><em>Edit:  I also bought Flower and Wipeout HD Fury which were PSN titles.  And that 3D Picross game for the Japanese DS.  So that brings the total to 11.</em></p><p>Don't get me wrong, 2009 had some great games, but many of which I finished in the span of a weekend and felt finished with them afterward.  I rented them through GameFly and just sent them back after completion.  Katamari and Dragon Age were exceptions to that...  Of course, there are still many I haven't gotten around to playing, yet.</p><p>2010 is looking very bright to me. There are many games coming in the next 5 months I can't wait to play.  There are as follows...</p><p>January 26th - <b>Mass Effect 2</b> - Xbox 360<br/>February 16th - <b>Ace Attorney Investigations: Edgeworth</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>February 16th - <b>KORG DS-10 Plus</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>February 23rd - <b>Heavy Rain</b> - Playstation 3<br/>March 9th - <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> - Playstation 3<br/>March 14th - <b>Pokemon Heart Gold / Soul Silver</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>March 16th - <b>Dragon Age Awakening (expansion)</b> - Xbox 360<br/>March 22nd - <b>Yakuza 3</b> - Playstation 3<br/>May 11th - <b>3D Dot Game Heroes</b> - Playstation 3</p><p>There's 9 games on the list already, and that doesn't include Dead Rising 2, Epic Mickey, Sin and Punishment 2, Metroid Other M, <a href="http://augmentpro.com/halloween-ghostwire-augmented-reality-game-for-2010/" title="http://augmentpro.com/halloween-ghostwire-augmented-reality-game-for-2010/">Ghostwire</a> (that Augmented Reality ghost game on the DSi), Death Smiles and any other shmup that may be released in North America.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up a Nintendo DSi XL when those are released.  My Nintendo DS has been beaten incredibly hard and the touchscreen cannot be calibrated for accuracy anymore.  It has served me well these past 4 years, but games like Ouedan and Trauma Center are unplayable.</p><p>And with KORG DS-10 Plus and Ghostwire actually making use of the DSi features, it should be worth it.  Plus, there's all those downloadable puzzle games. ^_^  And there's that pile of unplayed DS games sitting on my shelf, as well.</p><p>Video Games!<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/42">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/40">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
