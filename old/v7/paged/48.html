| June 11, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Like most rhythm games that don't include "Guitar Hero" or "Rock Band" in the title, <b>DJ Max</b> has its very niche audience.  It's a rhythm based game just like any other, but is exclusive to the PSP, which cuts the audience down even further.  It's developed by Korean group Pentavision Entertainment and it's music selection is all dancey electronic songs.  Maybe some Hip Hop too.  I'm not sure...</p><p>Unfortunately, I've skipped the entire DJ Max series.  When DJ Max Portable was first released in the fall of 2006, half a year after the American PSP launch, this was my game to buy!  But I never got around to it.  I finally bought a PSP, but still never got around to buying it.  Even when the game finally came out in America, I still didn't buy it for some reason.  I just wasn't in the mood, I guess.</p><p>In March 2009, they announced that Pentavision was releasing a <a href="http://www.bemanistyle.com/djmaxfever/" title="http://www.bemanistyle.com/djmaxfever/">super deluxe packaged release</a> much like their releases in Korea.  So I finally decided that today was the day!  It was limited to a mere 125 pieces.  My Collector's instinct kicked in and I bought one as soon as they were available.</p><p>A month later it finally shipped.  And when I got back from Japan, it finally arrived.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3833.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3833.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3833.webp"  /></p><p>This thing is huge.  That press release had a picture of the side that made it look like a regular PSP case.  There's no way this thing will fit on my shelf.  Pfft.</p><p>The packaging is really nice though.  The material is a hard plastic cardboard.  There are embedded magnets on the flap that keep the box sealed shut.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3834.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3834.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3834.webp"  /></p><p>On the inside, everything is nice and snug inside felt-like grooves.  Included in The Crew Edition is..</p><p>- a 3 disc set of CDs comprising the Soundtrack to DJ Max Fever<br/>- a DJ Max Art book<br/>- a 500 piece puzzle<br/>- a Post Card set<br/>- a Funky Mask<br/>- a DJ Max players card to register high scores online<br/>and<br/>- a copy of DJ Max Fever signed by the Developers.</p><p>Now let's take a look at that last one...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3836.webp"  /></p><p>The copy of DJ Max Fever is signed alright, but it's signed on the OUTSIDE of the cellophane.  What the hell good does that do me? I can't unwrap the game.  It'll render the signature useless!  So I still can't play this game I've put off for so long.  Aside from that, this box is huge and doesn't fit on my shelf.</p><p>I think my money would've been better spent buying all the other versions of the game, rather than an expensive version of a single game that I can't open.  At least I can sell it on eBay for a little more than what I bought it for.  Which is what I'll probably do in a couple years.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to B-Quality Gaming All Stars: Cavia Inc" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/b-quality-gaming-all-stars-cavia-inc">B-Quality Gaming All Stars: Cavia Inc</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Around 2003 and 2004 was the tipping for me when it came to expecting high quality games and movies.  I think it was The Matrix Reloaded that finally pushed me over the edge.  I realized that ridiculous plots and over the top action can make incredible experiences regardless of them actually making sense.</p><div class='title'><b>Drag-on Dragoon / Drakengard</b></div><p>I think Drag-on Dragoon (aka Drakengard) was the video game equivalent for me.  Published by <b>Squaresoft</b> in 2003 (2004 in US), Drag-on Dragoon was touted as their answer to Dynasty Warriors.  You were one man against massive armies of enemy soldiers.  On the battlefield, your soul is fused with a Dragon, and together you fight to end the war and achieve piece.</p><p>It sounds pretty normal... but Jesus was this game bad.  I'm pretty sure it broke me.  In fact, I have the text to prove it!  Read my original thoughts from 5 years ago: <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions" title="/drakengard-impressions">May 22nd, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-2" title="/drakengard-impressions-2">May 27th, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-3" title="/drakengard-impressions-3">June 1st, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-4" title="/drakengard-impressions-4">June 6th, 2004</a>.</p><p>First off, The title is pretty ridiculous in its own right.  Japanese titles in general are sometimes pretty crazy, but what the hell does Drag-On Dragoon even mean?!</p><p>Secondly, War brings you to some crazy places.  Killing shit loads of soldiers doesn't really get to me when they're trying to spear or slice me.  But after a few hours in the game, you come across a village whose only defense are their <b>children</b>.  These children hardly hurt you, and they SCREAM very loudly when you tear them apart with your sword.  What the hell is this game trying to teach me?!</p><p>Then shit gets weird...</p><p>Drag-on Dragoon has 5 endings.  The first 3 are pretty normal, but the story branch for the other two endings opens the gateway to HELL.  This massive expanse unloads hundreds upon thousands of gigantic hideous flying human babies into the sky and out for BLOOD.  The first thing they do is devour one of your characters like a fucking animal.  Tearing off her arms and legs.  Stripping the meat from her bones.</p><p>It was the most grotesque surreal image I've ever seen in a video game.  Then the level begins and you're flying around killing these babies.  When these babies die their skin begins melting from their face and bodies as they let out a scream that will haunt me forever.</p><p>I will never forget this video game...  Though, I'd still never heard of <b>Cavia</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Cavia Incorporated</b></div><p>Underneath the cries of dying melting demon babies was Cavia.  Cavia was founded in 2000, partly by Hayao Nakayama, former President of Sega Japan.</p><p>After 3 years in business, they finished their first original game Drag-on Dragoon with Squaresoft publishing.  Their previous games were Anime licenses and such.  And really that's the bulk of their work.  Some Naruto games, Ghost in the Shell, Steam Boy, Dragonball Z, Death Note.  A lot of Namco/Bandai licenses, actually.  These are the type of games you wouldn't play anyways.</p><p>But they pay the bills and give them the freedom to go crazy with games like Drag-on Dragoon.  2 years later they made <b>Drag-on Dragoon 2</b>, but I have not gotten around to playing it.  In that same year, they also finished <b>Beat Down</b>, published by Capcom.</p><div class='title'><b>Bullet Witch</b></div><p>In 2007, I would be graced by Cavia's developmental (emphasis on mental) expertise with Bullet Witch.  Bullet Witch was published by Atari in North America.  I wrote about this game, too! <a href="/old/v7/xbox-360-bullet-witch" title="/xbox-360-bullet-witch">November 13th, 2007</a>.</p><p>Bullet Witch takes place in the near future after half the world has been killed by biological warfare.  An airborne virus has infected and killed most of humanity.  And makes them just weak enough to be ravaged and torn apart when demons climb out of the ground.</p><p>You play as Alicia, who is not quite human.  She has magical abilities to dispel the demons.  But when that doesn't work she has a big gun to rip apart her foes with bullets.</p><p>The demons definitely aren't as off-putting as 30 feet demon babies.  But they still distort and contort their human victims in unnatural ways that made me shake a couple times.  Every enemies still erupts in gallons of blood, too!</p><p>Bullet Witch lets up on the weird psycho shit a bit, and focused a lot more on gaming moments.  My favorite moment is 10,000 feet in the air and fighting some huge flying demon on top of a 747 airliner.  The flying demon is a huge cloud of eye balls that break off and lung themselves at you.</p><p>The dialogue is absolutely b-quality-tastic!  While Drag-on Dragoon is a repetitive boring pile of shit, Bullet Witch has fun with itself.  It's a great way to spend 6 or 7 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>Nier</b></div><p>You may have heard of this game recently.  Cavia and Squaresoft are back together again for a new tale.  You are a one man army killing hordes of demons.  The world is plagued by disease and darkness.  Yes!  That sounds like Cavia to a T!</p><p>Last week at E3, Square released a trailer that described a bit of the story and some of the gameplay.  But that was pretty much it.  The website actually has some content now: <a href="http://na.niergame.com/?lang=US" title="http://na.niergame.com/?lang=US">http://na.niergame.com/</a>.  But overall, there isn't much known about Nier.</p><p>I pity the poor person who sees footage of this game and thinks it's the greatest thing ever.  I mean, I'm somewhat excited for the game, but the "Game Experience" is not what I'm after.  I want this game to shock and disturb me the way that Drag-on Dragoon did when I first sliced into a child.  I want to root for the home team as the characters stumble over their lines of ridiculous dialogue.</p><p>I want to have fun with it. ^_^</p><p>In the meantime, there's Drag-on Dragoon 2 and Beat Down, both on Playstation 2.  I think I'll check those out and bridge the gap between 2003 and 2007.  Stay classy, Cavia.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ladytron, The Faint @ Metro, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago">Ladytron, The Faint @ Metro, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in April, I finally got the chance to see one of my favorite electronic bands Live in Concert.  I'm not sure why Ladytron were on tour, but they came through Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>Ladytron has 4 members and originated in Europe (somewhere) in 1999.  They are somewhat hard to place because of some of their lyrics are in English, while others are not.  I always thought it sounded like Russian, but it's not..  It's not German either..  Wikipedia indicates Bulgarian.</p><p>I started listening to them somewhat by chance.  They'd been recommended to me a couple times, but it wasn't until I came across their CD in Exclusive Company (now out of business) that I decided that today was the day!  (Actually, that was only 3 years ago..)  One by one, I picked up each of their CDs and began listening to them more and more.</p><p>In the beginning their songs are pretty girly.  Most of the lyrics were about boys or other emo topics.  One song seems directly inspired by lead singer Helen Marnie's brief career as a fashion model.  "They only want you when you're 17.  When you're 21, you're no fun."</p><p>By 2003, with their release of Softcore Jukebox, I think they grew out of the emo mentality and started branching out with their music.  They tooked some risks and made some fun songs. ^_^</p><p>After that, Witching Hour and Velocifero were a definite return to their iconic electronic pop sound.  They've had some fantastic songs, but I think they rely on that sound a little too much.  I'd love for them to do another release on the lines of Softcore Jukebox.</p><p>One of my friends commented, "It's good to see a band steer away from emo lyrics.  I think most bands tend to start off strong and then go emo."</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron Live</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp"  /></p><p>My copies of 604 (their first album) and Light &amp; Magic (their second album) were actually re-releases that contained Live versions of their most popular songs.  This is the part of the CD I generally skip over because the levels are all weird and you can't hear the flange of the synthesizer pulling together the bass.</p><p>Unfortunately, this "problem" wasn't with the recording...  When Ladytron took the stage, it sounded like their levels were way off.  It sounded very amateur grunge (or whatever) without the omnipresent bass.  After a couple songs, I totally got into the event, but I think that was because I damaged my ears enough that everything blended together.</p><p>They played all of their iconic songs..  Ghosts, Runaway, Sugar, Seventeen, Destroy Everything You Touch, The Way That I Found You..  It was fantastic to actually hear a band live and know all the songs for a change. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp"  /></p><p>Afterwards, they were downstairs in Smartbar spinning records, but I pulled the old man thing and complained about my legs killing me and how all the kids in the venue are stupid.  So we left.</p><p>But before that...</p><div class='title'><b>The Faint</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp"  /></p><p>The Faint were pretty rockin'.  Prior to this engagement, I'd not heard of them.  So I didn't really pay close attention to them when they got up on stage, but throughout their set they won me over.  Not enough to actually buy their music, but enough to enjoy their performance a whole lot.  Their synthesized sounds mixed perfectly with their instrumental sounds. ^_^</p><p>The combination of The Faint and Ladytron made this night fantastic.  It sucks that we wussed out on their DJ sets, though, but oh well.  I'll visit Smartbar one of these days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rebuild of Evangelion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rebuild-of-evangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For those who don't know, Evangelion is one of, if not THE, most popular Anime series in Japan.  My pal Justin and I started on the ground floor of its popularity in the US back when it was first being released in 1997 and 1998.  It's the series that put American Anime distributor and localizer ADV Films into a shit load of cash.</p><p>It original aired on Japanese TV in 1995 for a total of 26 episodes.  The final two episodes lead to a bit of an outcry by fans at to what the fuck creator Hideaki Anno was thinking.  Budgetary restraints kept the final two episodes very cheap.  Episodes were poorly animated, but kept a pencil drawing type scheme which looked "artsy".</p><p>Despite everyone hating these two episodes, I liked them.  These two episodes got rid of all the other distractions of plot, military, espionage, and other characters, Anno picked the most important aspect of the show and completely focused on it for the ending: Shinji.</p><p>I think most people (especially Americans) hate this because Shinji constantly whines about responsibility, is spineless, and feels he has no worth.  Americans don't give a shit about a coward for a main character.  Especially whens there's explosions and robots everywhere else in the show. The ending shows how Shinji finally over comes all the fears of himself and becomes confident.  "Good job, Shinji!"</p><p>But no.  The fans were outraged!  As such, Hideaki Anno created an alternate ending which replaced those two episodes which kept Shinji spineless and afraid.  And allowed Seele to completely control him and absolutely reset humanity.  Fans didn't know what to think of this ending.  But they got some amazing action sequences, so most of them consider it the better ending.</p><p>Blah blah blah...</p><div class='title'><b>But this is not how it happened!</b></div><p>With two endings to his story, neither of which does a good job of ending the series, Anno has returned.  He's making 4 "all new" movies to tell Evangelion as it was meant to be told.  The <b>Rebuild of Evangelion</b> is a complete re-imagining of the story from start to finish with a completely different ending that satisfies all aspects of the story.  (or so we've been told).</p><p>The first 2 movies will mostly be direct remakes of the original episodes.  Eva 3.0 will begin diverging and take the story to its new ending.  And Eva Final will put an end to everything Evangelion.</p><p>What I've been watching since March is the first movie, entitled...</p><p><b>Evangelion 1.0 You are (not) alone</b> SPOILERS, btw</p><p>This movie remakes episodes 1 through 6 of the original series.  During the episodes Shinji fights 3 Angels ("of death"): Sachiel, Shamshel, and Ramiel.  The plot, themes and whatnot are absolutely identical in both the series and this movie.  One might think that this is the stupidest thing ever.  Especially when the first 18 minutes of the film is almost an exact shot-by-shot update to the original animation.  <b>The genius of the movie is the pacing.</b></p><p>There really is no tension when Shinji fights Sachiel and Shamshel because the scenes are nearly the same as the original and the fans already know what's going to happen.  Sure, it looks prettier but the fights are the same.  Plus, after Shamshel you have that long boring part where Shinji runs away and nothing really happens.</p><p>Then Ramiel appears.  Ramiel is a bit shinier, but still looks the same...  until..</p><p><object width="640" height="505" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p><p>Holy shit.  That's different.  Ramiel is absolutely menacing.  Ramiel is pretty abstract to begin with, but now his attacks show the full force of his destructive power.</p><p>We still know what happens, but the Ramiel fight takes center stage.  I immediately shot awake and continued watching with my eyes glued to the screen.  Ramiel is far more dangerous than I remember him...  maybe in Evangelion 1.0, Ramiel actually does win.  How the hell are they going to stop this thing?</p><p>Unlike the series where this is just another episode, the movie builds up to this point and flourishes.  Shinji's own confidence builds to this point as well.  He's beginning to think about why he should pilot Evangelion, rather than doing what he's told.  Both plot lines balance in harmony as Shinji fires upon Ramiel to prove his worth.</p><p>With the ending of Evangelion 1.0, Hideaki Anno proves that both plots with Shinji and Evangelion can co-exist and satisfies both camps who prefer either ending of the original.</p><p>Stay tuned in November for the American release!</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 2.0 You can (not) advance</b></div><p>Let the speculation begin.  Eva 2.0 is released in Japanese theaters on Sat June 27th.  Shots from the trailer feature Angels all the way up to Zeruel, the 14th Angel.  As such, apparently this movie will cover episodes 7 all the way through 19, which is TWICE the amount as the first movie.  That's a shit load of ground to cover.  Especially when these episodes feature FAR more story than anything that went on in the first 6 episodes.</p><p>I have no idea how they plan to cram everything into 2 hours, but I guess we'll see!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.11 You are (not) alone" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">Evangelion 1.11 You are (not) alone</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A week and a half ago, Evangelion 1.0 was finally released on Bluray entitled Evangelion 1.11.  Not only was this the initial Bluray release for the new movie, but it also adds another 10 or 15 minutes of additional footage into the mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp"  /></p><p>Today, I got it in the mail!  I tore upon the Play-Asia envelope, quickly unwrapped the cellophane and put it into my Playstation 3.  Thanks to the advent of Bluray technology, "they" decided to redistribute which territories fit into which Regions.</p><div class='title'><b>Regions</b></div><p>For DVD Regions, the world was split into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg">6 regions</a>.  Unfortunately, the US and Japan were split.  Japan and Europe were snug into Region 2, but the US and Canada were in Region 1, all alone.</p><p>Bluray is different.  The world is now split into only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg">3 regions</a>.  All of the Americas, Japan and the Philippines occupy the same territory.  And Europe is on the outside with almost everyone else.  That's good!  Now the US has the ability to play Japanese Blurays at our convenience.</p><p>This only gives the ability to play the Bluray, of course.  There is no Bluray magic that transforms the speech into English or anything.  It is what it is.  And this particular Bluray <b>only offers Japanese Audio with no Subtitles</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Why then?</b></div><p>3 months ago, I finally downloaded Eva 1.0 and watched it, though I had a <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">little trouble</a>.  It's kinda weird that I waited so long to finally watch it considering how much I love the Anime.  I watched it and absolutely loved it.  But the quality was pretty bad.  It was good for Internet standards, but there were some scenes that were rough.</p><p>That's the main reason I bought the Bluray.  I wanted to see this film with absolute clarity.  And Evangelion 1.11 does not disappoint.  It is crystal clear and absolutely beautiful.  The sound is amazing too!</p><p>Also, It's not like I need the subtitles, anyways.  After spending so much time getting the subtitles to work on the copy I download back in <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">March</a>, I wondered why I wasted so much time.  I've seen the Anime almost 100 times now and basically have the whole thing memorized.</p><div class='title'><b>Great Bluray, but one problem...</b></div><p>It's annoying that there are no English subtitles.  Half of the reason I buy any movies these days is to share it with people.  And I can't really share this with my friends because they don't know Japanese.  We could attempt to watch it, and I could probably "translate".  But that would really be confusing.  Especially for my friends who've never seen Evangelion before.</p><p>Oh well.  The American release is in November.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Dave, Dan and I caught them for their most recent visit to The Rave in Milwaukee.  They came through the Midwest this weekend on tour of their 4th artist album, Divided by Night.</p><p>It's rather interesting that an electronica group so synonymous and iconic with electronic music has only released 4 artist albums.  These guys are legends and have been heard all over the world.  Even if you're reading this and don't know who The Crystal Method are, chances are that you've heard their music before but didn't know it.</p><p>Their first album, Vegas, which was released back in 1997 has been sampled, optioned, and used all over entertainment.  I was actually quite delighted when they played "Busy Child" during their set this evening. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp"  /></p><p>The Crystal Method rocked!  I've seen them before WAY back in 2002 when they were touring for their first mix album, Community Service.  Unfortunately, I don't have pictures from that event since it was before I owned a camera!</p><p>That night was pretty fun, but they just played their CD basically.  The first 7 songs from their set were mixed almost identically to the first 7 songs of their album.  Event-wise, I think they were too used to playing songs rather than being a DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp"  /></p><p>This was the first time I've seen them perform their music Live and it is a world of difference.  It was an amazing night with a super-friendly crowd that totally got into the music.  Everyone in the audience had a real great time.</p><p>The atmosphere completely changed once The Crystal Method got up on stage.  The aura at the beginning of the night was rather stale and toe-tapping.  It was playful, but the DJ didn't really know how to pump up a crowd.  He'd start building up to something, but then immediately tear it down.  He'd use songs with off-beat bass.  And he ended his set with "Push it" by Salt-n-Pepa.  weird...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp"  /></p><p>Once he left and The Crystal Method took the stage, the audience exploded.  A smile came across everyone's face, and everyone started bouncing around.  Whooo!  It was marvelous. ^_^</p><p>I wonder if they get this sort of attention everywhere, or if it's really unique to The Rave.  At the end of the set, they said that this venue was their favorite amongst the world.  That they've never had a bad crowd in Milwaukee.  I don't know if they were just pandering to the crowd or if they were honest or embellishing, but I'd believe it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pygmy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pygmy">Pygmy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 4, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One month ago today, Chuck Palahniuk released his 10th novel entitled Pygmy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp"  /></p><p>It's doing pretty well, too.  It debuted as number 3 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html">New York Times Best Seller List</a>.</p><p>For his latest novel, he kept his book tour brief.  He toured only 6 or 7 cities, none of which were in the Midwest.  It's unfortunate, but he did tour twice last year, once for his 9th novel "Snuff" and for "Choke", the film adaption of his 4th novel.  I caught his "Snuff" tour last year: <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">http://theschlock.com/blog/?p=452</a>.</p><p>Much like last year, he announced his next novel.  Next year, Chuck will release his 11th novel entitled "Tell All".  He also mentioned that while caring for his mother last year, he wrote 3 novels, so there's still plenty Chuck down the pipeline.  You can read more about it at <a href="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all" title="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all">The Cult</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>St. Helens Book Shop</b></div><p>Even though, I missed him touring, I did purchase a signed first edition of Pygmy from St. Helens Book Shop.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp"  /></p><p>St. Helens Book Shop is Chuck Palahniuk's local book store near Portland, Oregon.  Whenever he's back in town he'll stop by and sign copies of most of his books that they have in stock.  For Pygmy, if you pre-ordered the book through them, Chuck would be in the store the weekend before the book shipped and sign all of their Pre-order editions.  So, that's what I did.  It also has a bunch of tour stamps on it, too.</p><p>This isn't limited to Pygmy or new releases. You can get any Chuck Palahniuk book they have in stock signed or even personalized if you wish.  Which is great, since Chuck Palahniuk tours have attracted some large crowds and no longer has the time to sign everyone's books because of the demand.</p><p>If you're interested check out <a href="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors" title="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors">St. Helens Book Shop</a>. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Pygmy</b></div><p>Anyways, I just finished reading Pygmy this afternoon on the bus ride home.</p><p>Pygmy is about a foreign exchange student living in America whose actually an undercover terrorist.  He and his fellow foreign classmates have been tasked to carry out Operation Havoc.  To take down and destroy our lazy American country.  It's a comedy and a romance!</p><p>The number one thing I love about Chuck Palahniuk's writing is how easy they are to read.  It's the reason that kept me reading after Fight Club.  Unfortunately, this book was not an easy read for me.  Pygmy is written from the perspective of the foreign exchange student, so it's ALL broken English.</p><p>That's a feat of its own.  Writing and consistently writing broken English must've driven him insane.  It's daunting at times to read it, but I couldn't imagine writing like this.</p><p>The text itself is pretty funny.  And conveying how odd our society is to a more traditional culture is also pretty hilarious.  But it is exhausting to read.  I finished the book today, and I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of some the characters were.  The broken English is really a crutch that keeps me from enjoying the book at times.</p><div class='title'><b>Variety</b></div><p>But I can hardly condemn the writing style because it's really an adventurous experiment and brings a new dimension to understanding the main character.  Pygmy himself tries to understand America and communication intentions, but they fall flat amongst the American characters in the book.  He brings the misunderstanding back into his own text as he accounts what happened that day.</p><p>Pygmy is incredibly unique.  I'd say it's Chuck's most unique novel yet.  Since Diary, he's really been experimenting with different ways of telling and developing his stories.  Diary was written from the point of someone in a Coma throughout the book.  Haunted contained short stories written by each character involved in a murder scheme.  Rant was from all points of view except the main character.  Snuff focused on 4 main characters who had there own views on the 5th main character.</p><p>His first 5 novels were so similar in style.  It's incredibly interesting to see just how far away from that he's willing to go.  Pygmy is really his first novel since then that was completely written from the main character's perspective and half the time you don't even know what's going on!</p><div class='title'><b>Not Bad</b></div><p>I'd definitely recommend Pygmy if you're interested in reading something you aren't used to.  Even though the writing is a bit different for Chuck, there are still plenty of themes and events that scream his story writing style. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Other M" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m">Metroid Other M</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the grand finale of Nintendo's Press Conference yesterday, Reggie asked the rhetorical questions, "Could a new edgier game, also be coming from us? ...  We've partnered with a development team with a <em>proven track record</em> in the <em>mature</em> space to give us a <em>fresh take</em> at a <em>storied</em> franchise. .. Here's the preview."</p><p>They rolled the clip, which immediately began with Team Ninja's company intro.  "Project M presents" emerges from a space field of meteors.  "Project M" had been a secret project or team floating around the Wii for a while.  Some stuff in the trailer happens, Samus appears, and title "Metroid Other M" materializes before our eyes.</p><p>Even though most people figured that the M in "Project M" probably stood for Metroid rather than Mario, it's nice to see some confirmation. ^_^  But the addition of Team Ninja is a bit of a shocker.  Team Ninja is about as un-Nintendo as you can get.  They're the development team behind such hits as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series.  They pride themselves on flashy over-the-top Anime-style action gameplay and sequence.  Where as Nintendo is pretty traditional and conservative about their games.  I don't think you could get a "fresh"er look than that.</p><p>The trailer showed a whole lot of action with Samus flipping and hopping around the areas physically beating up enemies, as well as firing them down with her plasma gun.  The trailer also showed several clips of full-fledged cutscenes, which is something Metroid has never done before.</p><p>My immediate gut reaction was not very pleasant.  The Metriod series has always stood for exploration. Adding in all these action sequences feels like they're cheapening the name.</p><div class='title'><b>To the rescue!</b></div><p>Luckily, Jeremy Parish conducted an interview with Team Ninja's Yusuke Hayashi and Project M's Yoshio Sakamoto and asked the hard hitting questions: <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587</a></p><p>His asked a question that dug into the heart of what I wanted to know.  "How do your two completely different game design patterns fit together and still keep Metroid faithful?"  They assured Parish, that Metroid Other M is definitely an exploratory game.  It's just the fire fights have been choreographed with the precision we'd expect from Team Ninja.</p><p>Having Project M head the actual game planning put me at ease about the whole Team Ninja thing.  It sounds like they've wanted to (or were pushed into) develop a "true" 3D Metroid game, but had a little trouble with how they were to implement they actual gameplay.  That's where Team Ninja helped them out. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Parish went on to ask Sakamoto about where Other M falls into the Metriod timeline, to which he replied, "It's part of the flow, story-wise, between Super Metroid and Fusion."  Which makes sense since the trailer ends with a cinematic of the final scene of Super Metroid.</p><p>The actual chronological order of the Metroid games is all over the map.  It's used to be so easy, but then Metroid Prime was thrown in the mix between Metroid 1 and 2... and then the subsequent releases could do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Here's what it looks like now, as taken from the <a href="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline" title="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline">Metroid Wikia</a>:</p><p>Metroid (NES, 1986) / Metroid Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime (GC, 2002)<br/>Metroid Prime Hunters (DS, 2006)<br/>Metroid Prime 2 (GC, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime 3 (Wii, 2007)<br/>Metroid 2 (GB, 1991)<br/>Super Metroid (Snes, 1994)<br/><b>Metroid Other M</b> (Wii, 2010)<br/>Metroid Fusion (GBA, 2002)</p><div class='title'><b>Project M explained</b></div><p>To end with, Sakamoto returns to explain what is Project M.  It turns out that Project M is a collaboration of 3 companies working on Other M.  There's the Nintendo team, headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, co-creator of the Metroid series.  There's Team Ninja, headed by Yusuke Hayashi.  And a Third team responsible for the cinematic and game visuals.</p><div class='title'><b>Crisis Averted</b></div><p>After reading that interview, I'm totally excited for Metroid Other M.  It's a new Metroid game designed by the core Metroid team!  Finally!</p><p>Though, they've mentioned Metroid Fusion quite a bit in this Interview.  When released, Metroid Fusion  had some mediocre reviews.  Personally, I never got around to playing it, but I've heard the progress is fairly linear.  Hopefully Metroid Other M will stick to its full exploratory roots that they claim it will.</p><div class='title'><b>The sequel curse</b></div><p>Come to think of it, the Metroid series has a very interesting patterns emerging from its sequels, not unlike the Star Trek series.  All the odd numbered releases are amazing, but the even releases miss the point, or aren't as fun.  Let's see here...</p><p>1986: Metroid 1 ++ new and different!<br/>1991: Metroid 2 -- linear and weird<br/>1994: Super Metroid ++ Best game ever made<br/>2002: Metroid Fusion -- linear again and kinda weird<br/>2002: Metroid Prime ++ Fresh!<br/>2004: Metroid Prime 2 -- horribly unoriginal and dumb<br/>2004: Metroid Zero Mission ++ Excellent!<br/>2006: Metroid Prime Hunters -- forgotten and weird<br/>2007: Metroid Prime 3 ++ Not Bad!<br/>2010: Metroid Other M +/-  thumbs down?!</p><p>So...  does that mean in 2010 we'll be dissapointed?  Pfft.. it's just a silly curse.  Star Trek XI (aka JJ Abrams' Star Trek) is an odd numbered Star Trek and it's pretty damn spiffy.  Curses are meant to be broken.  (or was that "promises are meant to be broken")<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games Games Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-games-games">Games Games Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 2, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>E3 has been fantastic so far, and today was an exceptional day for gamers.  Unlike <a href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me" title="/its-all-melting-around-me">last year when the world was melting around me</a>, Nintendo and Sony had some substantial unveils and a fantastic line up of games.  There are some pretty great looking games coming out on all 3 console platforms and its gotten me excited about video games again!</p><div class='title'><b>Microsoft</b></div><p>From Microsoft's Press Conference <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> looked amazing.  That beginning scene of climbing up the side of a mountain is WORLDS beyond that horrible Modern Warfare 1 opening... ugh.  It's reminds me of the beginning of Mission Impossible 2 actually.  And Star Trek V, come to think of it.  Except you aren't on vacation.  You're scaling this mountain to join a fire fight that ends with a Snowmobile battle!  That totally looks like fun. ^_^</p><p>The next thing I found mildly exciting was the demonstration of <b>Halo Recon</b> (or ODST as they call it these days.)  Though, it's really more of the same.  Walking around, shooting up brutes and other aliens.  They announced <b>Halo Reach</b>, which is another Halo 3 prequel...  Solid Rental titles!</p><p>They also showed off Xbox Live's upcoming synergy with the online space and social networking including <b>Last.fm</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, and <b>Twitter</b>.  I really wonder how many gamers will be twittering and facebooking from their Xbox.  I'll probably hook up all my accounts to Live, but I doubt I'll actually use them after that initial hour.</p><p>And then Kojima came to the stage and announced <b>Metal Gear Solid Rising</b>, a Raiden centric Metal Gear game that leads into Metal Gear Solid 4.  Even though, it was announced for the Xbox, it's also coming to the Playstation, so that makes me happy. ^_^  The REAL megaton would've been if it were Xbox exclusive.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Microsoft showed off <b>Project Natal</b> which uses Camera motion sensing for input.  Instead of having a crappy motion controller, you use your arms, legs, and your entire body to do crap.  Why do we need this crap?  In addition, Peter Molyneux announced their Natal project entitled <b>Milo</b>.  Milo is a 13 year old boy that you talk and interact with.  Fucking creepy, if you ask me.</p><p>And they ended on that.  They showed off far more games than I described above including <b>Crackdown 2</b>, <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, <b>Alan Wake</b>, <b>Rockband: Beattles</b>, <b>Tony Hawk Ride</b> with that ridiculous skateboard controller, <b>Forza 3</b>, and a couple of other games.</p><p>All in all, I think Microsoft's conference was pretty solid.  They showed off a ton of games and some new stupid crap to boot!  They didn't show anything from Mass Effect 2 though...</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Nintendo started right off the bat by announcing <b>New Super Mario Brothers Wii</b>, a 4 player co-op/competitive take on the 2006 DS game.  This game looks incredibly fun.  It's very much like Legend of Zelda 4 Swords, in which you have 4 players basically playing the same 2D game at the same time.  I can't wait to play this game at parties.</p><p>Then they went off on Wii Fit Plus and Wii Motion Plus and how 3rd Party adoption of Wii Motion Plus is great.  They showed off some RPGs.  Crystal Bearers on Wii looks a lot like Sin &amp; Punishment.  Mario &amp; Luigi RPG 3 was announced for America!  And Golden Sun DS!  They also mentioned <b>Zelda Train Simulator</b> in there somewhere.</p><p>Then they announced <b>Women's Murder Club: Games of Passion</b>, which sounds like an episode of the Red Shoe Diaries..  These are interactive novels written by James Patterson for the DS.  Sounds very interesting.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Iwata got up on stage, talked for too long, and then unveiled something EVEN more bizarre than Project Natal, the <b>Wii Vitality Sensor</b>.  It's an accessory that you clip on your finger, and it monitors your heart rate.  Iwata mentioned no properties that used this, no gaming prospects, nothing!  "Look what we made!  It's a thing!"  Were they just going for the hat-trick of announcing 3 upcoming accessories for the Wii, or was there an actual purpose for unveiling this technology?!</p><p>Reggie returned to the stage and brought us all back to earth by announcing <b>Super Mario Galaxy 2</b>!  Really?!  Why?  Isn't it a little soon for another canon Mario game?  This reminds me a lot of Japanese Super Mario Bros 2 (aka Lost Levels), where they reused all the assets from the first game, and just added more levels.  I think Mario Galaxy 2 cheapens Mario Galaxy 1.  Which is unfortunate because Mario Galaxy is a <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-impressions" title="/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">fantastic</a> <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts" title="/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts">achievement</a>.</p><p>Reggie continued by showing off their strong third party lineup including The Conduit, Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles and Dead Space Extraction.</p><p>And then Reggie concluded with <b>Metroid Other M</b>, which I have mixed feelings about.  Metroid Other M is being developed by Team Ninja, creators of the new Ninja Gaiden series.  The trailer showed the prospects of a very story-centric Metroid mixed with a whole lot of action.  While I'm excited about Story returning to Metroid, which has been absent throughout Metroid Prime, I think the over-the-top action sequences will cheapen the depth of gameplay Metroid is known for.  We shall see....</p><p>Nintendo has a strong start and a strong finish, but it was so goddamn boring in the middle.  Still, they have a pretty decent lineup coming up.  They didn't announce Pikmin 3 nor Zelda Wii nor Kid Icarus.  Seriously though, why would they announce Zelda Wii when they've got Zelda Train Simulation coming up!  They'll announce it next year, and by then it'll almost be done!</p><div class='title'><b>Sony</b></div><p>Out of the big 3, I think Sony's brand is spread the furthest across gaming.  They have the Playstation 2, Playstation 3 and the PSP.</p><p>Well, they begin with some games.  Naughty Dog reps get up on stage and begin to demo <b>Uncharted 2</b>, which looks pretty nice.  The graphics have that very warm color palette that almost all PS3 exclusive titles have.  All the models are very solid and tangible.</p><p>The demo begins across some rooftops until they've discovered by a helicopter!  The helicopter opens fire and you're leaping from balcony to balcony, jumping away from gun fire, dodging bullets, while holding cover and blowing away some bad dudes...  This whole scene totally reminds me of the helicopter fight from Tomorrow Never Dies.  You escape into a building, but it's taken damage from the helicopter and eventually tumbles to the ground seconds after you leap out a window to safety!</p><p>I don't think I've ever seen an action sequence in a game so closely resemble something seen in an action movie.  That demo was incredible.  And Nathan Drake is hilarious as he makes subtle commentary during the fight scenes.</p><p>They showed off the new PSP, and some other games and eventually got to the new trailer for <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, with that absolutely fantastic battle music. Afterward, Jack Trenton starts talking about the "next" Final Fantasy game, which I assume is Final Fantasy XIII Versus, but he says <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b>.  What?!  Did I hear that right?  "Exclusive to Playstation 3 is Final Fantasy XIV, roll that beautiful bean footage!"</p><p>What the?!  Final Fantasy XIII isn't even out yet.  and Final Fantasy XIV is expected to release globally in 2010?!  At the end, the trailer says "Final Fantasy XIV Online", and everyone slaps their head, "D'oh!"  It's just the successor to Final Fantasy XI.  Well, hopefully it won't be as boring...</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Some Sony dudes get to the stage and unveil an accessory that is the spitting image of one of those "back massagers" that everyone uses as a vibrator.  I could hardly contain my laughter sitting at my desk at work.  "We want this device to be in the hands of our consumers." AHahahahahhaa</p><p>But the demo wasn't that bad.  The detection looked far better than the Wii-mote.</p><p>Sony ended with 3 more PS3 games: Gran Turismo 5, God of War 3, and <b>The Last Guardian</b>, which was what I was waiting for.  Previous known as Project Trico, this is the third game in the Team ICO trilogy which includes ICO and Shadow of the Colossus.  They played the trailer that was leaked a couple weeks ago, but had a couple more pieces that were missing before.  It looks fantastic ^_^ and of all 3 press conferences, <b>this is my number 1 game</b>.  I cannot wait for The Last Guardian.  ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of steam from Sony's Conference was taken away by constant leaks leading up to E3.  The Final Fantasy XIV announcement was huge!  But they would've nailed it out of the park if The Last Guardian hadn't leaked, and the PSP Go hadn't leaked.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Nintendo's conference was a little boring, but overall all 3 had some solid games and great announcements. ^_^  All 3 platforms have games I'm interested in for the upcoming year, which makes me excited to be a gamer once again.  Honestly, I thought Christmas 2008 was horrible for games.  Dead Space was the only game that hit it out of the park, and that came out in September.  The disappointments were vast..  Fable 2 sucked, Mirror's Edge sucked, Fallout 3 is boring.  I don't even remember what was released for Wii.</p><p>But for Late 2009, Early 2010, there's tons of crap!  Something for everyone.  Games Games Games!  Even weird ones.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tokyo Tower" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower">Tokyo Tower</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm totally excited, but the day's traveling has worn that down a little bit.  It's not until my batteries are fully recharged that my energy empowers my excitement.  That first morning back in Japan is like Christmas as a Child.</p><p>I want to do everything!  And my first destination was Tokyo Tower, which is its own symbol of regeneration.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp"  /></p><p>After World War II, Japan was a defeated nation.  They were down, but not out.  Everyone in the nation pulled together to rebuild Japan.  Japan flourished once again.</p><p>In 1953, NHK began broadcasting for the first time.  But the signal was too weak for the entire Kanto region to receive its signals.  It was clear that a large transmission tower would be needed to boost the signal, or else moderately sized ones would choke Tokyo.</p><p>They called upon Tachu Naito to architect such a tower.  He chose the France's Eiffel Tower as a starting point, and designed a structure so secure that it could withstand an Earthquake twice the strength of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake (8.3 on the Richter Scale) and typhoons with wind speeds up to 140 miles an hour.</p><p>When completed it stood 30 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.  It became a symbol for Japan.  A monument to their efforts to rebuild Japan and their growing economic power.</p><p>Thank you, Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp"  /></p><p>Tokyo Tower has 2 observatory decks.
