| June 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in April, I finally got the chance to see one of my favorite electronic bands Live in Concert.  I'm not sure why Ladytron were on tour, but they came through Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>Ladytron has 4 members and originated in Europe (somewhere) in 1999.  They are somewhat hard to place because of some of their lyrics are in English, while others are not.  I always thought it sounded like Russian, but it's not..  It's not German either..  Wikipedia indicates Bulgarian.</p><p>I started listening to them somewhat by chance.  They'd been recommended to me a couple times, but it wasn't until I came across their CD in Exclusive Company (now out of business) that I decided that today was the day!  (Actually, that was only 3 years ago..)  One by one, I picked up each of their CDs and began listening to them more and more.</p><p>In the beginning their songs are pretty girly.  Most of the lyrics were about boys or other emo topics.  One song seems directly inspired by lead singer Helen Marnie's brief career as a fashion model.  "They only want you when you're 17.  When you're 21, you're no fun."</p><p>By 2003, with their release of Softcore Jukebox, I think they grew out of the emo mentality and started branching out with their music.  They tooked some risks and made some fun songs. ^_^</p><p>After that, Witching Hour and Velocifero were a definite return to their iconic electronic pop sound.  They've had some fantastic songs, but I think they rely on that sound a little too much.  I'd love for them to do another release on the lines of Softcore Jukebox.</p><p>One of my friends commented, "It's good to see a band steer away from emo lyrics.  I think most bands tend to start off strong and then go emo."</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron Live</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2898.webp"  /></p><p>My copies of 604 (their first album) and Light &amp; Magic (their second album) were actually re-releases that contained Live versions of their most popular songs.  This is the part of the CD I generally skip over because the levels are all weird and you can't hear the flange of the synthesizer pulling together the bass.</p><p>Unfortunately, this "problem" wasn't with the recording...  When Ladytron took the stage, it sounded like their levels were way off.  It sounded very amateur grunge (or whatever) without the omnipresent bass.  After a couple songs, I totally got into the event, but I think that was because I damaged my ears enough that everything blended together.</p><p>They played all of their iconic songs..  Ghosts, Runaway, Sugar, Seventeen, Destroy Everything You Touch, The Way That I Found You..  It was fantastic to actually hear a band live and know all the songs for a change. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2934.webp"  /></p><p>Afterwards, they were downstairs in Smartbar spinning records, but I pulled the old man thing and complained about my legs killing me and how all the kids in the venue are stupid.  So we left.</p><p>But before that...</p><div class='title'><b>The Faint</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2862.webp"  /></p><p>The Faint were pretty rockin'.  Prior to this engagement, I'd not heard of them.  So I didn't really pay close attention to them when they got up on stage, but throughout their set they won me over.  Not enough to actually buy their music, but enough to enjoy their performance a whole lot.  Their synthesized sounds mixed perfectly with their instrumental sounds. ^_^</p><p>The combination of The Faint and Ladytron made this night fantastic.  It sucks that we wussed out on their DJ sets, though, but oh well.  I'll visit Smartbar one of these days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090403_ladytron/IMG_2926b.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rebuild of Evangelion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rebuild-of-evangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For those who don't know, Evangelion is one of, if not THE, most popular Anime series in Japan.  My pal Justin and I started on the ground floor of its popularity in the US back when it was first being released in 1997 and 1998.  It's the series that put American Anime distributor and localizer ADV Films into a shit load of cash.</p><p>It original aired on Japanese TV in 1995 for a total of 26 episodes.  The final two episodes lead to a bit of an outcry by fans at to what the fuck creator Hideaki Anno was thinking.  Budgetary restraints kept the final two episodes very cheap.  Episodes were poorly animated, but kept a pencil drawing type scheme which looked "artsy".</p><p>Despite everyone hating these two episodes, I liked them.  These two episodes got rid of all the other distractions of plot, military, espionage, and other characters, Anno picked the most important aspect of the show and completely focused on it for the ending: Shinji.</p><p>I think most people (especially Americans) hate this because Shinji constantly whines about responsibility, is spineless, and feels he has no worth.  Americans don't give a shit about a coward for a main character.  Especially whens there's explosions and robots everywhere else in the show. The ending shows how Shinji finally over comes all the fears of himself and becomes confident.  "Good job, Shinji!"</p><p>But no.  The fans were outraged!  As such, Hideaki Anno created an alternate ending which replaced those two episodes which kept Shinji spineless and afraid.  And allowed Seele to completely control him and absolutely reset humanity.  Fans didn't know what to think of this ending.  But they got some amazing action sequences, so most of them consider it the better ending.</p><p>Blah blah blah...</p><div class='title'><b>But this is not how it happened!</b></div><p>With two endings to his story, neither of which does a good job of ending the series, Anno has returned.  He's making 4 "all new" movies to tell Evangelion as it was meant to be told.  The <b>Rebuild of Evangelion</b> is a complete re-imagining of the story from start to finish with a completely different ending that satisfies all aspects of the story.  (or so we've been told).</p><p>The first 2 movies will mostly be direct remakes of the original episodes.  Eva 3.0 will begin diverging and take the story to its new ending.  And Eva Final will put an end to everything Evangelion.</p><p>What I've been watching since March is the first movie, entitled...</p><p><b>Evangelion 1.0 You are (not) alone</b> SPOILERS, btw</p><p>This movie remakes episodes 1 through 6 of the original series.  During the episodes Shinji fights 3 Angels ("of death"): Sachiel, Shamshel, and Ramiel.  The plot, themes and whatnot are absolutely identical in both the series and this movie.  One might think that this is the stupidest thing ever.  Especially when the first 18 minutes of the film is almost an exact shot-by-shot update to the original animation.  <b>The genius of the movie is the pacing.</b></p><p>There really is no tension when Shinji fights Sachiel and Shamshel because the scenes are nearly the same as the original and the fans already know what's going to happen.  Sure, it looks prettier but the fights are the same.  Plus, after Shamshel you have that long boring part where Shinji runs away and nothing really happens.</p><p>Then Ramiel appears.  Ramiel is a bit shinier, but still looks the same...  until..</p><p><object width="640" height="505" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzjH353gf9c&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p><p>Holy shit.  That's different.  Ramiel is absolutely menacing.  Ramiel is pretty abstract to begin with, but now his attacks show the full force of his destructive power.</p><p>We still know what happens, but the Ramiel fight takes center stage.  I immediately shot awake and continued watching with my eyes glued to the screen.  Ramiel is far more dangerous than I remember him...  maybe in Evangelion 1.0, Ramiel actually does win.  How the hell are they going to stop this thing?</p><p>Unlike the series where this is just another episode, the movie builds up to this point and flourishes.  Shinji's own confidence builds to this point as well.  He's beginning to think about why he should pilot Evangelion, rather than doing what he's told.  Both plot lines balance in harmony as Shinji fires upon Ramiel to prove his worth.</p><p>With the ending of Evangelion 1.0, Hideaki Anno proves that both plots with Shinji and Evangelion can co-exist and satisfies both camps who prefer either ending of the original.</p><p>Stay tuned in November for the American release!</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 2.0 You can (not) advance</b></div><p>Let the speculation begin.  Eva 2.0 is released in Japanese theaters on Sat June 27th.  Shots from the trailer feature Angels all the way up to Zeruel, the 14th Angel.  As such, apparently this movie will cover episodes 7 all the way through 19, which is TWICE the amount as the first movie.  That's a shit load of ground to cover.  Especially when these episodes feature FAR more story than anything that went on in the first 6 episodes.</p><p>I have no idea how they plan to cram everything into 2 hours, but I guess we'll see!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.11 You are (not) alone" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">Evangelion 1.11 You are (not) alone</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A week and a half ago, Evangelion 1.0 was finally released on Bluray entitled Evangelion 1.11.  Not only was this the initial Bluray release for the new movie, but it also adds another 10 or 15 minutes of additional footage into the mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090608_eva/IMG_3832.webp"  /></p><p>Today, I got it in the mail!  I tore upon the Play-Asia envelope, quickly unwrapped the cellophane and put it into my Playstation 3.  Thanks to the advent of Bluray technology, "they" decided to redistribute which territories fit into which Regions.</p><div class='title'><b>Regions</b></div><p>For DVD Regions, the world was split into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVD-Regions_with_key-2.svg">6 regions</a>.  Unfortunately, the US and Japan were split.  Japan and Europe were snug into Region 2, but the US and Canada were in Region 1, all alone.</p><p>Bluray is different.  The world is now split into only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blu-ray_regions_without_key.svg">3 regions</a>.  All of the Americas, Japan and the Philippines occupy the same territory.  And Europe is on the outside with almost everyone else.  That's good!  Now the US has the ability to play Japanese Blurays at our convenience.</p><p>This only gives the ability to play the Bluray, of course.  There is no Bluray magic that transforms the speech into English or anything.  It is what it is.  And this particular Bluray <b>only offers Japanese Audio with no Subtitles</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Why then?</b></div><p>3 months ago, I finally downloaded Eva 1.0 and watched it, though I had a <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">little trouble</a>.  It's kinda weird that I waited so long to finally watch it considering how much I love the Anime.  I watched it and absolutely loved it.  But the quality was pretty bad.  It was good for Internet standards, but there were some scenes that were rough.</p><p>That's the main reason I bought the Bluray.  I wanted to see this film with absolute clarity.  And Evangelion 1.11 does not disappoint.  It is crystal clear and absolutely beautiful.  The sound is amazing too!</p><p>Also, It's not like I need the subtitles, anyways.  After spending so much time getting the subtitles to work on the copy I download back in <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">March</a>, I wondered why I wasted so much time.  I've seen the Anime almost 100 times now and basically have the whole thing memorized.</p><div class='title'><b>Great Bluray, but one problem...</b></div><p>It's annoying that there are no English subtitles.  Half of the reason I buy any movies these days is to share it with people.  And I can't really share this with my friends because they don't know Japanese.  We could attempt to watch it, and I could probably "translate".  But that would really be confusing.  Especially for my friends who've never seen Evangelion before.</p><p>Oh well.  The American release is in November.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method @ The Rave, Milwaukee</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Dave, Dan and I caught them for their most recent visit to The Rave in Milwaukee.  They came through the Midwest this weekend on tour of their 4th artist album, Divided by Night.</p><p>It's rather interesting that an electronica group so synonymous and iconic with electronic music has only released 4 artist albums.  These guys are legends and have been heard all over the world.  Even if you're reading this and don't know who The Crystal Method are, chances are that you've heard their music before but didn't know it.</p><p>Their first album, Vegas, which was released back in 1997 has been sampled, optioned, and used all over entertainment.  I was actually quite delighted when they played "Busy Child" during their set this evening. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3747.webp"  /></p><p>The Crystal Method rocked!  I've seen them before WAY back in 2002 when they were touring for their first mix album, Community Service.  Unfortunately, I don't have pictures from that event since it was before I owned a camera!</p><p>That night was pretty fun, but they just played their CD basically.  The first 7 songs from their set were mixed almost identically to the first 7 songs of their album.  Event-wise, I think they were too used to playing songs rather than being a DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3791.webp"  /></p><p>This was the first time I've seen them perform their music Live and it is a world of difference.  It was an amazing night with a super-friendly crowd that totally got into the music.  Everyone in the audience had a real great time.</p><p>The atmosphere completely changed once The Crystal Method got up on stage.  The aura at the beginning of the night was rather stale and toe-tapping.  It was playful, but the DJ didn't really know how to pump up a crowd.  He'd start building up to something, but then immediately tear it down.  He'd use songs with off-beat bass.  And he ended his set with "Push it" by Salt-n-Pepa.  weird...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3813.webp"  /></p><p>Once he left and The Crystal Method took the stage, the audience exploded.  A smile came across everyone's face, and everyone started bouncing around.  Whooo!  It was marvelous. ^_^</p><p>I wonder if they get this sort of attention everywhere, or if it's really unique to The Rave.  At the end of the set, they said that this venue was their favorite amongst the world.  That they've never had a bad crowd in Milwaukee.  I don't know if they were just pandering to the crowd or if they were honest or embellishing, but I'd believe it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090606_tcm/IMG_3816.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pygmy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pygmy">Pygmy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 4, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One month ago today, Chuck Palahniuk released his 10th novel entitled Pygmy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3674.webp"  /></p><p>It's doing pretty well, too.  It debuted as number 3 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/books/bestseller/besthardfiction.html">New York Times Best Seller List</a>.</p><p>For his latest novel, he kept his book tour brief.  He toured only 6 or 7 cities, none of which were in the Midwest.  It's unfortunate, but he did tour twice last year, once for his 9th novel "Snuff" and for "Choke", the film adaption of his 4th novel.  I caught his "Snuff" tour last year: <a href="/old/v7/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour" title="/chuck-palahniuks-snuff-tour">http://theschlock.com/blog/?p=452</a>.</p><p>Much like last year, he announced his next novel.  Next year, Chuck will release his 11th novel entitled "Tell All".  He also mentioned that while caring for his mother last year, he wrote 3 novels, so there's still plenty Chuck down the pipeline.  You can read more about it at <a href="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all" title="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/news/first-details-for-chuck-palahniuks-2010-novel-tell-all">The Cult</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>St. Helens Book Shop</b></div><p>Even though, I missed him touring, I did purchase a signed first edition of Pygmy from St. Helens Book Shop.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090604_pygmy/IMG_3676.webp"  /></p><p>St. Helens Book Shop is Chuck Palahniuk's local book store near Portland, Oregon.  Whenever he's back in town he'll stop by and sign copies of most of his books that they have in stock.  For Pygmy, if you pre-ordered the book through them, Chuck would be in the store the weekend before the book shipped and sign all of their Pre-order editions.  So, that's what I did.  It also has a bunch of tour stamps on it, too.</p><p>This isn't limited to Pygmy or new releases. You can get any Chuck Palahniuk book they have in stock signed or even personalized if you wish.  Which is great, since Chuck Palahniuk tours have attracted some large crowds and no longer has the time to sign everyone's books because of the demand.</p><p>If you're interested check out <a href="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors" title="http://www.sthelensbookshop.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=localauthors">St. Helens Book Shop</a>. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Pygmy</b></div><p>Anyways, I just finished reading Pygmy this afternoon on the bus ride home.</p><p>Pygmy is about a foreign exchange student living in America whose actually an undercover terrorist.  He and his fellow foreign classmates have been tasked to carry out Operation Havoc.  To take down and destroy our lazy American country.  It's a comedy and a romance!</p><p>The number one thing I love about Chuck Palahniuk's writing is how easy they are to read.  It's the reason that kept me reading after Fight Club.  Unfortunately, this book was not an easy read for me.  Pygmy is written from the perspective of the foreign exchange student, so it's ALL broken English.</p><p>That's a feat of its own.  Writing and consistently writing broken English must've driven him insane.  It's daunting at times to read it, but I couldn't imagine writing like this.</p><p>The text itself is pretty funny.  And conveying how odd our society is to a more traditional culture is also pretty hilarious.  But it is exhausting to read.  I finished the book today, and I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of some the characters were.  The broken English is really a crutch that keeps me from enjoying the book at times.</p><div class='title'><b>Variety</b></div><p>But I can hardly condemn the writing style because it's really an adventurous experiment and brings a new dimension to understanding the main character.  Pygmy himself tries to understand America and communication intentions, but they fall flat amongst the American characters in the book.  He brings the misunderstanding back into his own text as he accounts what happened that day.</p><p>Pygmy is incredibly unique.  I'd say it's Chuck's most unique novel yet.  Since Diary, he's really been experimenting with different ways of telling and developing his stories.  Diary was written from the point of someone in a Coma throughout the book.  Haunted contained short stories written by each character involved in a murder scheme.  Rant was from all points of view except the main character.  Snuff focused on 4 main characters who had there own views on the 5th main character.</p><p>His first 5 novels were so similar in style.  It's incredibly interesting to see just how far away from that he's willing to go.  Pygmy is really his first novel since then that was completely written from the main character's perspective and half the time you don't even know what's going on!</p><div class='title'><b>Not Bad</b></div><p>I'd definitely recommend Pygmy if you're interested in reading something you aren't used to.  Even though the writing is a bit different for Chuck, there are still plenty of themes and events that scream his story writing style. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Other M" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m">Metroid Other M</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the grand finale of Nintendo's Press Conference yesterday, Reggie asked the rhetorical questions, "Could a new edgier game, also be coming from us? ...  We've partnered with a development team with a <em>proven track record</em> in the <em>mature</em> space to give us a <em>fresh take</em> at a <em>storied</em> franchise. .. Here's the preview."</p><p>They rolled the clip, which immediately began with Team Ninja's company intro.  "Project M presents" emerges from a space field of meteors.  "Project M" had been a secret project or team floating around the Wii for a while.  Some stuff in the trailer happens, Samus appears, and title "Metroid Other M" materializes before our eyes.</p><p>Even though most people figured that the M in "Project M" probably stood for Metroid rather than Mario, it's nice to see some confirmation. ^_^  But the addition of Team Ninja is a bit of a shocker.  Team Ninja is about as un-Nintendo as you can get.  They're the development team behind such hits as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series.  They pride themselves on flashy over-the-top Anime-style action gameplay and sequence.  Where as Nintendo is pretty traditional and conservative about their games.  I don't think you could get a "fresh"er look than that.</p><p>The trailer showed a whole lot of action with Samus flipping and hopping around the areas physically beating up enemies, as well as firing them down with her plasma gun.  The trailer also showed several clips of full-fledged cutscenes, which is something Metroid has never done before.</p><p>My immediate gut reaction was not very pleasant.  The Metriod series has always stood for exploration. Adding in all these action sequences feels like they're cheapening the name.</p><div class='title'><b>To the rescue!</b></div><p>Luckily, Jeremy Parish conducted an interview with Team Ninja's Yusuke Hayashi and Project M's Yoshio Sakamoto and asked the hard hitting questions: <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587</a></p><p>His asked a question that dug into the heart of what I wanted to know.  "How do your two completely different game design patterns fit together and still keep Metroid faithful?"  They assured Parish, that Metroid Other M is definitely an exploratory game.  It's just the fire fights have been choreographed with the precision we'd expect from Team Ninja.</p><p>Having Project M head the actual game planning put me at ease about the whole Team Ninja thing.  It sounds like they've wanted to (or were pushed into) develop a "true" 3D Metroid game, but had a little trouble with how they were to implement they actual gameplay.  That's where Team Ninja helped them out. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Parish went on to ask Sakamoto about where Other M falls into the Metriod timeline, to which he replied, "It's part of the flow, story-wise, between Super Metroid and Fusion."  Which makes sense since the trailer ends with a cinematic of the final scene of Super Metroid.</p><p>The actual chronological order of the Metroid games is all over the map.  It's used to be so easy, but then Metroid Prime was thrown in the mix between Metroid 1 and 2... and then the subsequent releases could do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Here's what it looks like now, as taken from the <a href="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline" title="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline">Metroid Wikia</a>:</p><p>Metroid (NES, 1986) / Metroid Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime (GC, 2002)<br/>Metroid Prime Hunters (DS, 2006)<br/>Metroid Prime 2 (GC, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime 3 (Wii, 2007)<br/>Metroid 2 (GB, 1991)<br/>Super Metroid (Snes, 1994)<br/><b>Metroid Other M</b> (Wii, 2010)<br/>Metroid Fusion (GBA, 2002)</p><div class='title'><b>Project M explained</b></div><p>To end with, Sakamoto returns to explain what is Project M.  It turns out that Project M is a collaboration of 3 companies working on Other M.  There's the Nintendo team, headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, co-creator of the Metroid series.  There's Team Ninja, headed by Yusuke Hayashi.  And a Third team responsible for the cinematic and game visuals.</p><div class='title'><b>Crisis Averted</b></div><p>After reading that interview, I'm totally excited for Metroid Other M.  It's a new Metroid game designed by the core Metroid team!  Finally!</p><p>Though, they've mentioned Metroid Fusion quite a bit in this Interview.  When released, Metroid Fusion  had some mediocre reviews.  Personally, I never got around to playing it, but I've heard the progress is fairly linear.  Hopefully Metroid Other M will stick to its full exploratory roots that they claim it will.</p><div class='title'><b>The sequel curse</b></div><p>Come to think of it, the Metroid series has a very interesting patterns emerging from its sequels, not unlike the Star Trek series.  All the odd numbered releases are amazing, but the even releases miss the point, or aren't as fun.  Let's see here...</p><p>1986: Metroid 1 ++ new and different!<br/>1991: Metroid 2 -- linear and weird<br/>1994: Super Metroid ++ Best game ever made<br/>2002: Metroid Fusion -- linear again and kinda weird<br/>2002: Metroid Prime ++ Fresh!<br/>2004: Metroid Prime 2 -- horribly unoriginal and dumb<br/>2004: Metroid Zero Mission ++ Excellent!<br/>2006: Metroid Prime Hunters -- forgotten and weird<br/>2007: Metroid Prime 3 ++ Not Bad!<br/>2010: Metroid Other M +/-  thumbs down?!</p><p>So...  does that mean in 2010 we'll be dissapointed?  Pfft.. it's just a silly curse.  Star Trek XI (aka JJ Abrams' Star Trek) is an odd numbered Star Trek and it's pretty damn spiffy.  Curses are meant to be broken.  (or was that "promises are meant to be broken")<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games Games Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-games-games">Games Games Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 2, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>E3 has been fantastic so far, and today was an exceptional day for gamers.  Unlike <a href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me" title="/its-all-melting-around-me">last year when the world was melting around me</a>, Nintendo and Sony had some substantial unveils and a fantastic line up of games.  There are some pretty great looking games coming out on all 3 console platforms and its gotten me excited about video games again!</p><div class='title'><b>Microsoft</b></div><p>From Microsoft's Press Conference <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> looked amazing.  That beginning scene of climbing up the side of a mountain is WORLDS beyond that horrible Modern Warfare 1 opening... ugh.  It's reminds me of the beginning of Mission Impossible 2 actually.  And Star Trek V, come to think of it.  Except you aren't on vacation.  You're scaling this mountain to join a fire fight that ends with a Snowmobile battle!  That totally looks like fun. ^_^</p><p>The next thing I found mildly exciting was the demonstration of <b>Halo Recon</b> (or ODST as they call it these days.)  Though, it's really more of the same.  Walking around, shooting up brutes and other aliens.  They announced <b>Halo Reach</b>, which is another Halo 3 prequel...  Solid Rental titles!</p><p>They also showed off Xbox Live's upcoming synergy with the online space and social networking including <b>Last.fm</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, and <b>Twitter</b>.  I really wonder how many gamers will be twittering and facebooking from their Xbox.  I'll probably hook up all my accounts to Live, but I doubt I'll actually use them after that initial hour.</p><p>And then Kojima came to the stage and announced <b>Metal Gear Solid Rising</b>, a Raiden centric Metal Gear game that leads into Metal Gear Solid 4.  Even though, it was announced for the Xbox, it's also coming to the Playstation, so that makes me happy. ^_^  The REAL megaton would've been if it were Xbox exclusive.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Microsoft showed off <b>Project Natal</b> which uses Camera motion sensing for input.  Instead of having a crappy motion controller, you use your arms, legs, and your entire body to do crap.  Why do we need this crap?  In addition, Peter Molyneux announced their Natal project entitled <b>Milo</b>.  Milo is a 13 year old boy that you talk and interact with.  Fucking creepy, if you ask me.</p><p>And they ended on that.  They showed off far more games than I described above including <b>Crackdown 2</b>, <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, <b>Alan Wake</b>, <b>Rockband: Beattles</b>, <b>Tony Hawk Ride</b> with that ridiculous skateboard controller, <b>Forza 3</b>, and a couple of other games.</p><p>All in all, I think Microsoft's conference was pretty solid.  They showed off a ton of games and some new stupid crap to boot!  They didn't show anything from Mass Effect 2 though...</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Nintendo started right off the bat by announcing <b>New Super Mario Brothers Wii</b>, a 4 player co-op/competitive take on the 2006 DS game.  This game looks incredibly fun.  It's very much like Legend of Zelda 4 Swords, in which you have 4 players basically playing the same 2D game at the same time.  I can't wait to play this game at parties.</p><p>Then they went off on Wii Fit Plus and Wii Motion Plus and how 3rd Party adoption of Wii Motion Plus is great.  They showed off some RPGs.  Crystal Bearers on Wii looks a lot like Sin &amp; Punishment.  Mario &amp; Luigi RPG 3 was announced for America!  And Golden Sun DS!  They also mentioned <b>Zelda Train Simulator</b> in there somewhere.</p><p>Then they announced <b>Women's Murder Club: Games of Passion</b>, which sounds like an episode of the Red Shoe Diaries..  These are interactive novels written by James Patterson for the DS.  Sounds very interesting.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Iwata got up on stage, talked for too long, and then unveiled something EVEN more bizarre than Project Natal, the <b>Wii Vitality Sensor</b>.  It's an accessory that you clip on your finger, and it monitors your heart rate.  Iwata mentioned no properties that used this, no gaming prospects, nothing!  "Look what we made!  It's a thing!"  Were they just going for the hat-trick of announcing 3 upcoming accessories for the Wii, or was there an actual purpose for unveiling this technology?!</p><p>Reggie returned to the stage and brought us all back to earth by announcing <b>Super Mario Galaxy 2</b>!  Really?!  Why?  Isn't it a little soon for another canon Mario game?  This reminds me a lot of Japanese Super Mario Bros 2 (aka Lost Levels), where they reused all the assets from the first game, and just added more levels.  I think Mario Galaxy 2 cheapens Mario Galaxy 1.  Which is unfortunate because Mario Galaxy is a <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-impressions" title="/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">fantastic</a> <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts" title="/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts">achievement</a>.</p><p>Reggie continued by showing off their strong third party lineup including The Conduit, Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles and Dead Space Extraction.</p><p>And then Reggie concluded with <b>Metroid Other M</b>, which I have mixed feelings about.  Metroid Other M is being developed by Team Ninja, creators of the new Ninja Gaiden series.  The trailer showed the prospects of a very story-centric Metroid mixed with a whole lot of action.  While I'm excited about Story returning to Metroid, which has been absent throughout Metroid Prime, I think the over-the-top action sequences will cheapen the depth of gameplay Metroid is known for.  We shall see....</p><p>Nintendo has a strong start and a strong finish, but it was so goddamn boring in the middle.  Still, they have a pretty decent lineup coming up.  They didn't announce Pikmin 3 nor Zelda Wii nor Kid Icarus.  Seriously though, why would they announce Zelda Wii when they've got Zelda Train Simulation coming up!  They'll announce it next year, and by then it'll almost be done!</p><div class='title'><b>Sony</b></div><p>Out of the big 3, I think Sony's brand is spread the furthest across gaming.  They have the Playstation 2, Playstation 3 and the PSP.</p><p>Well, they begin with some games.  Naughty Dog reps get up on stage and begin to demo <b>Uncharted 2</b>, which looks pretty nice.  The graphics have that very warm color palette that almost all PS3 exclusive titles have.  All the models are very solid and tangible.</p><p>The demo begins across some rooftops until they've discovered by a helicopter!  The helicopter opens fire and you're leaping from balcony to balcony, jumping away from gun fire, dodging bullets, while holding cover and blowing away some bad dudes...  This whole scene totally reminds me of the helicopter fight from Tomorrow Never Dies.  You escape into a building, but it's taken damage from the helicopter and eventually tumbles to the ground seconds after you leap out a window to safety!</p><p>I don't think I've ever seen an action sequence in a game so closely resemble something seen in an action movie.  That demo was incredible.  And Nathan Drake is hilarious as he makes subtle commentary during the fight scenes.</p><p>They showed off the new PSP, and some other games and eventually got to the new trailer for <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, with that absolutely fantastic battle music. Afterward, Jack Trenton starts talking about the "next" Final Fantasy game, which I assume is Final Fantasy XIII Versus, but he says <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b>.  What?!  Did I hear that right?  "Exclusive to Playstation 3 is Final Fantasy XIV, roll that beautiful bean footage!"</p><p>What the?!  Final Fantasy XIII isn't even out yet.  and Final Fantasy XIV is expected to release globally in 2010?!  At the end, the trailer says "Final Fantasy XIV Online", and everyone slaps their head, "D'oh!"  It's just the successor to Final Fantasy XI.  Well, hopefully it won't be as boring...</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Some Sony dudes get to the stage and unveil an accessory that is the spitting image of one of those "back massagers" that everyone uses as a vibrator.  I could hardly contain my laughter sitting at my desk at work.  "We want this device to be in the hands of our consumers." AHahahahahhaa</p><p>But the demo wasn't that bad.  The detection looked far better than the Wii-mote.</p><p>Sony ended with 3 more PS3 games: Gran Turismo 5, God of War 3, and <b>The Last Guardian</b>, which was what I was waiting for.  Previous known as Project Trico, this is the third game in the Team ICO trilogy which includes ICO and Shadow of the Colossus.  They played the trailer that was leaked a couple weeks ago, but had a couple more pieces that were missing before.  It looks fantastic ^_^ and of all 3 press conferences, <b>this is my number 1 game</b>.  I cannot wait for The Last Guardian.  ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of steam from Sony's Conference was taken away by constant leaks leading up to E3.  The Final Fantasy XIV announcement was huge!  But they would've nailed it out of the park if The Last Guardian hadn't leaked, and the PSP Go hadn't leaked.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Nintendo's conference was a little boring, but overall all 3 had some solid games and great announcements. ^_^  All 3 platforms have games I'm interested in for the upcoming year, which makes me excited to be a gamer once again.  Honestly, I thought Christmas 2008 was horrible for games.  Dead Space was the only game that hit it out of the park, and that came out in September.  The disappointments were vast..  Fable 2 sucked, Mirror's Edge sucked, Fallout 3 is boring.  I don't even remember what was released for Wii.</p><p>But for Late 2009, Early 2010, there's tons of crap!  Something for everyone.  Games Games Games!  Even weird ones.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tokyo Tower" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower">Tokyo Tower</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm totally excited, but the day's traveling has worn that down a little bit.  It's not until my batteries are fully recharged that my energy empowers my excitement.  That first morning back in Japan is like Christmas as a Child.</p><p>I want to do everything!

They were down, but not out.  Everyone in the nation pulled together to rebuild Japan.  Japan flourished once again.</p><p>In 1953, NHK began broadcasting for the first time.  But the signal was too weak for the entire Kanto region to receive its signals.  It was clear that a large transmission tower would be needed to boost the signal, or else moderately sized ones would choke Tokyo.</p><p>They called upon Tachu Naito to architect such a tower.  He chose the France's Eiffel Tower as a starting point, and designed a structure so secure that it could withstand an Earthquake twice the strength of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake (8.3 on the Richter Scale) and typhoons with wind speeds up to 140 miles an hour.</p><p>When completed it stood 30 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.

| May 31, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend I played Infamous.  From 4pm yesterday to about 9pm today, with a quick 6 hour nap in the middle.  I think it's somewhat sad that a single near 30 year old decided to spend his free weekend playing a video game almost 23 hours... But shut up.  I haven't had a free weekend in a while, and Infamous is pretty fun.</p><p>Infamous is a new Playstation 3 exclusive game which came out this week.  It's made by Sucker Punch, who are the development team behind the Sly Cooper franchise on PS2.  Last week, they released a demo on PSN and I liked it quite a bit.  So I cleared out my Gamefly queue, and got it in the mail rather promptly.</p><p>You play as Cole McGrath, who's been given Super Powers from the epicenter of a massive explosion that has killed 10,000 people in Empire City.  However, the military has labeled you responsible for the explosion and its up to you to find the real culprit.  Throughout your journey you'll restore order to Empire City, which has been taken over by street thugs.  Blah Blah Blah...</p><p>Cole has the power of electricity and can fire lightning bolts, create shockwaves.  He also has super-strength somehow because he can climb up the side of a building then leap all the way back to the ground without being hurt.</p><p>In Empire City, you can go anywhere and do anything, pretty much.  It's a free roaming sandbox sort of game.  Much like <b>Grand Theft Auto</b>, <b>Crackdown</b>, <b>Assassin's Creed</b>, etc...  There are story missions and side missions throughout the map and you can do them whenever you like.  The twist is the added morality gauge!  You decide whether Cole will be a Hero to Empire City, or its next up and coming Villian.</p><p>That's Infamous in a nutshell.  On the surface it seems like just another game, but Sucker Punch has carefully studied what's wrong with this sub-genre.  Infamous does a lot of things right, but still forgets about some fundamental problems..</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Recognized Difficulty.</b></div><p>At the very beginning, after you escape the crater, you get in your first fire fight with the Thugs.  This is your first mission, Spoiler!  You pull out your lightning hand and begin zapping all the bad guys.  When I completed this mission, the game automatically bumped me up to Hard Mode.  "Ok, you're way too good at shooting dudes.  Normal will be way too easy, you deserve Hard."</p><p>And the game was right!  For me, Hard Mode has worked out great.  It's still been pretty easy.  But there's never been a time when I've been so frustrated I couldn't eventually handle it.  Great Feature!</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Hidden crap shows up on the radar.</b></div><p>In any of those games mentioned above, there's a whole lot of stupid crap hidden through out the world.  Grand Theft Auto has 'em.  Assassin's Creed has 'em.  By gull, Infamous has to have 'em.  Infamous has  Dead Drops and Blast Shards scattered throughout Empire City.  They don't show up on the map, but if you click L3 to do your Spidey Sense, if you have one within range of your Rader, they'll appear!  Searching for this stuff has never been easier.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Hidden crap actually means something.</b></div><p>What real incentive is there to locate anything of this hidden stuff, anyways.  They only things collecting all the packages in Grand Theft Auto gave you was an Achievement.  In Infamous, the hidden stuff is actually useful.  Blast Shards are a means of leveling up your electricity gauge.  When you collect a certain amount, your capicity for holding electricty increases.  Dead Drops are encrypted transmissions that will give you further insight into the background of the story.  Collecting them all also gives you Achievements too.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Every side mission helps you.</b></div><p>In most games, side missions are usually just excuses to level your character or provide some aspect of the story that's not important.  The side missions in Infamous do that too, but when you complete one the territory that Thug's control begins to diminish.  More people return to the area and enemies retreat from the area.  When you go back to the area later for a story mission, it's a lot easier because the amount of enemies have lessened.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Magnetic Physics makes platforming easy.</b></div><p>Cole can climb walls, street lamps.. basically anything with a patruding space can be grabbed and climbed.  Which is a lot like Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge.  What's the point of running around a city, if you can't run around on rooftops!  The most annoying part of those two games is when you miss the mark just ever so slightly when you feel you totally nailed it.</p><p>Sucker Punch added a little bit of magnets into the physics so when you're climbing or falling, if you're near something that can be grabbed, Cole will naturally move closer to it.  It makes the hit box much larger, and platforming isn't really that annoying.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Being totally good has its subtle benefits.</b></div><p>No, It doesn't change the story at all.  It probably changes the ending, but the overall story is still the same.  What I really really like is when you're morality gauge is complete filled to good, the citizens of Empire City will actually help you fight the Thugs!  They'll start throwing rocks at the bad guys which makes them easier for Cole to kill!  That's awesome!  They'll cheer you on when you kill Thugs.  They'll cheer you on if you help them out.</p><p>Though, I'd wager that if you were totally Evil, the people would probably throw rocks at you.<br/>___</p><p>These are pretty small things, but they make Infamous incredibly solid.  They removed the more annoying aspects of the annoying parts on the game!  Like searching for hidden crap and platforming.  It ends up making the game less annoying and increases the mileage tremendously.</p><p>After 23 hours, I haven't been pissed off at the game once.  If I die or screw up, it's usually my fault and not the games.  That's quite an accomplishment because <b>most games are stupid and annoying and Infamous really isn't.</b> (&lt;---  Box Quote)</p><p>Playing Infamous is definitely where Infamous shines.  If people talk about Infamous, it'll be about some they did in the game.  Not something that the game did for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Hated!</b></div><p>But unfortunately, that's where Infamous' legacy falls apart for me.  There is nothing special about the Sound, the Music, the Story, the Characters...  Playing the game is great, but everything else falls flat and makes it rather unmemorable.</p><p>All I care about is my morality level, how many blast shards I still need to find, and the other side missions I have left.  I don't care about Cole at all.  I don't care about the climax of the game, nor what Villians I've killed.  Boss Fights have been anti-climatic because who cares?  They're just a bigger version of dudes I've fought earlier.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto IV was repetitive and way too long, but I cared about Niko and was sad when <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>bleep</em></span> died.  Niko is a great character, and that's what I remembered most from the game.  The other characters too.  "Cousin!"  There is nothing memorable about Cole or Zeke or any other character in Infamous.</p><p>So, after playing Infamous for 23 hours, <b>I really haven't gotten anything out of the experience at all</b>.  I wonder if its really worth while for me to take another 5 or 6 hours to finish the game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-museum">Ghibli Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>This story begins on eBay.</b></div><p>Since October last year, I've begun selling a lot of my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" /></p><p>There was a store for costumes, one for retro games, one for newer game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp">copies</a> of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3305.webp">Metal Wolf Chaos</a> on Xbox, but they were more than $70 each.</p><p>Nakano Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" /></p><p>The Ghibli Museum was very rustic and homely. ^_^  Nested snug in a heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, taking pictures inside the Museum was not allowed.  But, the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" /></p><p>The path continued along the back to reveal a Laputa stone.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" /></p><p>There were other spiffy areas in the museum, too.  Like a life-sized Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" /></p><p>This was one of those Sushi restaurant that had a conveyer belt running through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" /></p><p>They had the best California Rolls I've ever eaten.  The avacado was crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/49">« Previous Entries</a></div><div
