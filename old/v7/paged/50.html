| August 30, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From the massive fandom to the even more massive fandom, this year at the Penny Arcade, the crowds rule.  Last year, it really didn't feel all that crowded.  Sure there were tons of people, whose totals overcame 40,000, but I could still play stuff without waiting too long, and get into panels and main events I wanted to.</p><p>This year is huge.  After roaming around the exhibition hall, and going to some panels and movies, everything had some sort of line and a crowd.  We were unable to see Ken Levine's keynote and the inaugural Penny Arcade Q&A session of Friday because the room had been completed filled.  I don't think there were that many people last year that they refused entry.  Yet this year, the main event was moved in a larger room and was completely filled?  I'm sort of cringing at the amount of crowds we'll see today.  But I'm looking forward to playing a lot of game demos on Sunday.</p><div class='title'><b>Booths</b></div><p>Yesterday we spent a bunch of time overlooking all the booths and demos in the exhibition hall.</p><p>From Fallout 3...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1899.webp" /></p><p>To Deadspace...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1904.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1904.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1904.webp" /></p><p>To Onechanbara...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1906.webp" /></p><p>To Mirror's Edge to Left 4 Dead to Battlefield Heroes to Castle Crashers to Little Big Planet to Star Craft II to Wrath of the Lich King, to name a few.</p><p>Brawdo sports drink even had a booth.

Even though, it's probably the same thing you'll find in the Limited Edition copy of the game.

Last year, it was pretty neat seeing everyone actually in person record their podcast, but this year featured tons of special guests, from Ryan Davis (of Giant Bomb), to Shawn Elliot (of 1up), to Dan Trachtenberg, Alex Albrecht and Jeff Cananata (of Totally Rad Show), to Adam Sessler (of Xplay).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1919.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1919.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1919.webp" /></p><p>Afterwards I was quite fortunate to get their signatures on my most recent EGM.

I've found Waldo at a couple of places now.  Once at the Quest in Minneapolis, once at the <a href="/old/v7/barack-obama-in-madison" title="/barack-obama-in-madison">Obama Rally in Madison</a>, and now at PAX.  Waldo is getting easier to find.</p><div class='title'><b>Finishing off the night</b></div><p>After 1up Yours, Five, Jess and I caught up with Ace who had just finished his day of work and went to dinner.  We walked a few blocks to the nearby city mall, which had a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1927.webp">Daiso</a>!  Saw the movie, Second Skin in a video room.  And saw Jonathan Coulton, signing to a massive crowd in the dark.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" /></p><p>Jess worked one of the video rooms until the 3am closing time, so Five, Ace and I walked down to the Console Freeplay area and checked out a copy of Soul Caliber IV to keep us busy.  All the events and things during the day were pretty spectacular, but it's really the low key nature of just bull shitting around in a fighting game that really put a satisfying cap on the day.  It's was the same with playing DDR earlier, too.</p><p>I've really missed that social aspect of gaming since moving to Madison.  Most of the games I play have really all been single player experiences.  I'll get into games like Burnout Paradise for the online play, but I'm never playing with friends.  All the social aspects of a single player experience come from the aftermath for me.  After you've completed the game, and talk about it with people.</p><p>It was really great returning to that college atmosphere in the wee hours of the morning.  And Soul Caliber was the perfect vehicle.  I <a href="/old/v7/back-to-the-stage-of-history" title="/back-to-the-stage-of-history">wrote</a> about it a couple weeks, how Soul Caliber is really a window in the past for me with social gaming.  From playing with friends at Toys R Us, and getting to know people in college. It was the drug of choice, and playing it last night brought back all the fun warm fuzzy feelings.  ^_^</p><p>Also, Soul Caliber IV is fantastic and beautiful and I'm totally picking up a copy when I get back to Madison.  Even though I don't really have many people to play with, yet.  I think I'll introduce it some places and see how it goes.  Also, If those who do have the game play enough on their own, whenever we do get back together, we'll be on equal grounds.  (I'm looking at you Erika)<br/>___</p><p>So that's my Friday at PAX.  For the most part, I know what to expect today, so I won't be too disappointed if there's just too many people preventing me from seeing what I want.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Via Domus" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus">Lost Via Domus</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i><b>Lost Via Domus Spoliers</b></i></p><p>You'd think a television show such as Lost would be above whoring itself out to sell a couple of bucks but here are.  I'm pretty sure ABC owns the actual rights to the Lost name, or else this game probably would not have been made.  But after spending the afternoon with Lost Via Domus on Xbox, starting at Noon and finishing around 5:30pm, I'm glad it was made.</p><p>Lost Via Domus is a pretty decently put together fan fiction spanning 7 episodes taking place during Seasons 1 and 2 of Lost.  Each episode lasts about 30 to 45 minutes and centers on main character, Elliot Maslow.  Elliot finds himself on the island with no memory of the past and a mysterious man out to kill him.  Inklings of his past start to trickle back to him, when Lost characters confront him about his past.  Elliot must piece together his past in flashbacks while using this information in the present to progress further.</p><p>The writers of Lost Via Domus have a very good grasp of Lost lore.  Each Lost character confronts and deals with Elliot and his problems in a very stereotypical way for their character.  Jack doesn't believe you.  Sawyer doesn't care.  Hurley's your buddy.  Locke leads Elliot through the woods to find himself.  Michael yells Walt a couple times.</p><p>Each episode is meant to take place during the storyline of Lost, but in time breaks it and then breaks it completely wide open.  In the beginning, I was completely with Elliot fitting into Lost.  His character was out of the real story and in his own.  But eventually, Elliot starts to do things that he shouldn't be doing.  Like opening and closing blast doors from inside the hatch.  And using dynamite to blow open a secret area of the Swan hatch and neutralize the magnetic reactor.</p><p>The story does not fit into Lost, but the themes and style are pretty well put together and are very Lost.  The themes of your past eventually confront yourself on the island, and you have the choice to diverge from those themes and learn from the past, or doom yourself to repeat it.</p><p>Aside from that, the environment and graphics are absolutely beautiful though.  If you've ever wanted to walk around on the set of Lost, all you need to do is pick up this game.  You walk around the beach, the Swan hatch, the Hydra station, the Flame station.  You can even find the mediical "Staff" station and "Pearl" station to walk around to, if you can find them.  Each setting is absolutely perfect in the game, and taking pictures of various Lost props gets you achievement points.</p><p>Overall, I think Lost Via Domus is a very unique gaming anomaly.  It's an interactive fan-fiction totally made by and for Lost fans.  As a Lost fan, I can respect this product and think it succeeds at its goals.  As a gamer, the game isn't really all that bad.  It's well put together, but very simple.  If this game had a story completely of its own, I would probably like it on its own and look forward to what the team was doing next.</p><p>But, even after all these kind words, I would recommend it as a <b>rental only for Lost fans</b>.  Once you finish it, that's it.  It's just 7 episodes of fan-fiction...  nothing more.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Choke" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/choke">Choke</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year has been fantastic for movies.  Cloverfield.  Speed Racer.  Dark Knight.  I just got back from my second viewing of Pineapple Express.  Fantastic!  Summer is winding down, though.  The air has become chill.  And all the kids are back in town for college.  The year is not quite over, but there's still one movie left that I eagerly anticipate.  That's <b>Choke</b>.</p><p>9 years ago, <b>Fight Club</b> introduced me to the satirical dark writing of Chuck Palahniuk.  Throughout those 9 years, I've read all his novels, watched Fight Club a billion times, and even seen him in person.  Fight Club made me an instant fan.  It brought my from cinema into novels and even fosters some creative writing from time to time.  I'd probably be playing video games on the bus if not for Fight Club, really.</p><p>Anywho, 9 years later, another of Chuck's books has finally made it to theaters.  Choke opens September 26th in select theaters, but some people have already seen it at various film festivals.  And from what it looks like, there are some haters out there.  The negative reviews seem to have a similar tone... 'It ain't Fight Club'.  Well, it's funny you should mention that...</p><p>Fight Club has a very distinct tone throughout the movie.  It's a very dark dank vision of society and the people around you.  Putting on a polite show for humanity, despite feeling completely empty and emotionless.  Then starting to break out of your shell just a little with growing confidence in yourself as a person.  This distinct thought process is beautifully translated from the book into film.  When I read the novel, I feel like I'm inside the main character's head.  The same way you are in most of the film.</p><p>After I read Fight Club, I went right on to the next book.  I read Survivor, Choke, Lullaby, Invisible Monsters, and Diary.  Each one carried this same tone.  Each novel placed you deep into the main character's thought process, feelings and emotions.  As I read each novel, I felt completely in tune with the main character.  Choke felt very much like Fight Club.  Only a different setting, different character background, different vices.</p><p>3 months ago, I saw Chuck Palahniuk in Minneapolis for the release of his recent novel, Snuff.  During the event, they played the trailer for Choke.  I was excited.  Even more excited than I had been from just being at the event to begin with.</p><p>However, after viewing the trailer, I felt very conflicted.  It was absolutely nothing like how I pictured it in my mind.  As you can see for yourself, the tone is completely comical.  poppy.  funny on the outside.  Complete opposite emotions I felt when reading the book.  Not Like Fight Club.</p><p>So, I watched the trailer and the red band trailer a bunch of times and went back to read the book.  I read the book from the mindset of a comedy movie.  Maybe I just read it wrong?  Perhaps Fight Club was pushing my expectations into the deep dark mood because the movie effected me in such a way.  Maybe this is a strictly comedic book.</p><p>Naw.  The timing is totally off in the book.  The focus is clearly the emotions and thinking of the main character, Victor Mancini.  The little one liner jokes in the trailer are completely moved around to make it a comedy.</p><p>But!  Then again, these are fricken trailers.  Trailers are created by production staff to promote the movie to as wide an audience as possible.  Thinking back to 9 years ago, I thought Fight Club was garbage from the TV spots I saw.  I only saw it later on DVD when my friends made me watch it.  The overall feeling of the book or movie can't be easily illustrated in a 3 minute clip.</p><p>I'm still totally stoked for Choke, though.  I think I'm going into the film with a unique perspective that I have never  had with any movie I've seen before.  I think this'll be the first movie where I've read the book way in advance from the film being announced.  It's exciting to see the movie adaptation clash with my imagination.  For some reason I imagined the characters a lot skinnier...  Especially Paige Marshall.</p><p>4 more weeks!</p><p>Check out both trailers on the <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/" title="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/">Official Site</a>.  The can be a little tricky to find though.  Go to the restricted area, then go to videos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Scanner Darkly" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/scanner-darkly">Scanner Darkly</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today is Sunday, but it's not a normal Sunday.</p><p>I'm on a couch.  No, not my own couch.  I don't even own a couch.  It's a friend's couch and I'm stayed at his apartment last night.  He and I aren't the only ones here either.  Many friends of ours came to visit him.  We went to the massive drinking party known as Irish fest.  As usual, I drank more than my share, but I had a great time.  Drinking and Dancing.  I remember pretty much all of it.  The only part that escapes me where my steps exiting the gates and arriving to the couch.</p><p>But, it's now Sunday.  A very hazy Sunday.</p><p>Waking up is always a chore when your body feels wrecked.  All of us in the room, feel the same, so I'm in equal company.  It puts me in a good mood.  A grand time experienced by us all.  Time is short, though.  My bus back to Madison is in a few hours.  And my ride to the bus time is even sooner.  I shower and pack and off we go.  My friend has a very busy day so he drops me off with a good hour before the bus arrives.  Luckily, there's a Perkins nearby.</p><p>Sunday is a very popular day.  It's the most popular day for Perkins.</p><p>With half an hour before noon, the Perkins is filled with after-Church goers.  Many seniors with their best set of clothes on their old bodies.  Many children in their best Sunday dress or slacks.  Families, both old and young.  And me.  Standing in the entrance-way holding a backpack full of worn clothes and shampoo.  Holding another bag with my computer and other personal belongings.  Alone.  With slightly damp untied hair down past my shoulders.</p><p>Table for one, please...   Jim.</p><p>To the inquisitive population my mouth moves and spews out those words.  My eyes wander to the table of grandmas nearest to me.  Then they dart back across the restaurant to the front counter to catch a name tag.  Kim.  Slowing moving across the assortment of pies and muffins under glass.  I am a bit hungry, but that's way too much sugar for the morning.  That muffin is larger than my fist.</p><p>Should be about a 15 minute wait.</p><p>I figured that would be obvious from the crowds of lightly colored dressed people.  I find a bench and set my things down.  There are three other groups of people waiting beside me in this green and black carpeted foyer area.  Two of these groups are a single couple.  Both young men taking their girlfriends or wives to an early afternoon meal.  The other group could be either couple in 10 or 15 years.  A middle aged father in jeans with a ratty shirt with a Beer logo on it.  A wife with a big blonde pony-tail, jeans and jean-jacket combo holding a generic baby carrier with two screaming children using their mom as an obstacle for whatever game they're playing.  I smile, but inside I can't stop laughing.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>15 minutes later, the half-dead elderly couple had thoroughly scrapped themselves out of a booth for me.  I feign sincerity as they pass by.  I lift up my belongings and follow Kim to a now lonely booth by the window.  Such a waste.  Isn't there a smaller table for just one person?  Am I really expected to fill this 4 person space?  I complain to myself, but say only thanks.  My bags take up all the room next to me.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Quickly, A young short woman greets me.  She's incredibly perky for a Sunday morning.  Morning to me, anyways.  Hi, I reply.  She asks me if I want anything to drink.  Milk, I reply.  She asks me what size.  Large, I reply.  And what would you like to order today, She asks with a smile.  What's with all these questions.  So fast.  I hardly had anytime to look at the menu, let alone think a response.  Can I get a water too, I reply.  Sure thing, do you want a minute or two to look at the menu, She asks with a smile.  Yep, I reply.  And off she goes bouncing around with her blond pony tail swaying from side to side.</p><p>What <i>was</i> up with all those questions?  Do single patrons always know automatically what they wish to order?  Oh geez, I wonder what I was suppose to say...  Well, at least I can figure out what to order before she comes back.  I want an omelet of sorts.  Nothing else really looks as fine to me at this hour.  That's what I'll say when she returns.  And I'll practice it in my head a couple times so it doesn't sound weird.  Ugh, that's weird in of itself.</p><p>I bet that grandma over there think I'm weird.  Why is that gentlemen alone, she must wonder.  She probably asks herself a lot of useless questions like that.</p><p>The cheery waitress returns with my drinks and asks the question I've already answered in my head a couple times now.  I want an omelet of sorts.  What kind of sorts, she inquires.  One with tomatoes, mushrooms, veggies, and these two cheeses.  Splendid, she says with a smile.  You also get a muffin and some breakfast potatoes.  Splendid indeed.  And off she goes to put her scribblings up in the kitchen for the minimum wage chef.</p><p>I don't normally talk that way.  In fact, can I even be sure that really just happened?  Now I don't have anything to stare at with the menu gone.  Perhaps now is the best time to finally that book I've been reading.</p><p>Scanner Darkly</p><p>I've seen the movie before.  I've owned the movie for a while now.  And have watched it several times.  But the book is incredible.  Bob Arctor is truly beside himself in ways that the movie simply did not convey.  He is paranoid and a drug addict.  He feels he's doing the right thing by working for the police and spying on his friends.  His dark dank life is injected with a little good through himself.  But Bob Arctor is also Fred.  The undercover law enforcement officer spying on Bob Arctor and his friends.  What despicable lives they have.</p><p>Bob Arctor continuously takes Substance D as a stress reliver, recreational activity, and... well, just because it's there really.  He's addicted.  And the overuse of Substance D causes his brain to split.  The two hemispheres reveal conflicting information.  One side is Bob Arctor, the depressed drug addicted loser.  The other is Fred, the crappy undercover cop who's really wasting the government's time.</p><p>Reading the book reveals the full picture of Bob Arctor and his friends.  The movie is really just excerptse from the book.  Carefully chosen and edited scenes picture perfect from the text to paint a cohesive story that leaves several details out.  Details that didn't really matter to the story, but gave more insight to Bob Arctor and his growing paranoia.</p><p>I like this book a lot.  The whole 60s/70s lingo is fun too.</p><p>This is the first book written by Philip K Dick I've read, and I plan to continue read more.  But I get the feeling they won't live up to this one.  I'm not really a big fan of Sci Fi novels.  I think Sci Fi novels focus too much on the science fiction of the environment rather than the characters...  and so forth.  I love reading about the characters and what they're thinking during events.</p><p>Here ya go, sweetie.</p><p>Excellent.  Eggs, Veggies and little breakfast potatoes.  I consume them while getting closer to the ending.  The perfect meal for this Sunday.  I get my muffin to go and say Goodbye to the lovely waitress with a handsome tip.  The sun is slightly higher in the sky and I have 30 minutes before the bus arrives.  Through the window, I see the waitress bouncing around from one table to the next.  Across the street, I see my destination.  The bus stop.</p><p>Over the road and across the parking lot to the Goerke's Corner I go.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent

The world is split up into 6 worlds in which you use Time as the main catalyst to advance and collect puzzle pieces.  The basic premise of the story is fairly standard at first.  Tim is looking for the princess, and with the completion of each world, is told the princess is in another castle.</p><p>On the surface that is all this game is.  Hopping, Skipping and Jumping.  Standard gameplay mechanics until you begin realizing your actions as the player.  You're killing endless amounts of these golems to achieve success.  To regain a puzzle piece piecing together a lost memory.  Once you've collected the pieces and assembled the puzzle, the memory is complete.  Yes, you have been here and these were your actions.</p><p>The next puzzle complete and the next puzzle complete.  You descend into madness searching for your lost princess.  Where is she?!  You are obsessed.  No one will stand in my way.  She is my princess and how dare you hide her from me.  Your senseless evil monsters will not win.  You can't win.  I am the true hero.</p><p>Thus it continues.  The senseless murder continues until it is complete.  You cannot find her in the present.  Your future is void without her.  The past is the key.  You've been using Time all along to find her.  It's time to go back to where it began.  That single night.</p><p>Backwards on that day with death following you.  When we worked together with the one goal of being reunited.  It was then when I finally reached your window and peered at you asleep that you screamed and ran.  I tried to catch up..  I tried to catch you.  And you tried to kill me.  You ran away.  But I will find you.  Nothing will come in my way.</p><p>There had to be something missing in all my memories.  Very hidden hints of something larger.  Those pesky stars in which I cheated to find.  With nearly all of them, I cannot only relive the event of that day, but change it slightly to obtain her.  And that is what I did.  And now all that is around me is on fire.  A smile crept onto my face.  But I had to ask myself, 'Is this what I thought happiness would be'?</p><p>____</p><p>Tim is a psycho.  The world that you control his actions appears like a cutesy little video game in Tim's eyes.  But what are his actions in real life.  How many doors have you broken into?  How many grizzly townfolk have you trampled?  How many kingdoms have you crumbled?  Does the princess even exist?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Back to the Stage of History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/back-to-the-stage-of-history">Back to the Stage of History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 1, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Man, Soul Caliber really brings me back almost 9 years ago to the Dreamcast release of 9/9/99.  The first exposure I had with Soul Caliber was setting up all the playable Dreamcast kiosks in Toys R Us.  2 were setup with our pre-release copy of Sonic Adventure, and I setup a third with Soul Caliber because everyone in the store wanted to play it.</p><p>I turned on the TV and the Dreamcast, the little orange dot danced around the screen and painted the curly Dreamcast logo, and the opening cinema began.  The camera flying across the dusty ground with weapons piercing the land.  It was the most graphically impressive things I'd ever seen.  At that point, Final Fantasy VIII's cinemas were the best thing I'd seen, but those were all pre-rendered.  Soul Caliber was ALL real time and was much faster and shinier than those FFVIII cutscenes.</p><p>I instantly liked Soul Caliber, but I didn't fall in love until March the next year when I actually bought a Dreamcast and had my own copy of Soul Caliber.  I was pretty good at it. ^_^  I was able to completely trampled my casual-gaming friends and hold my own against my hardcore-gaming friends.  It was a head-to-head competitive game that everyone played and everyone had in common.  When visiting someone or them visiting me, Soul Caliber would also find itself into the visit.  Even later on, once I started college, we always came back to Soul Caliber.  It was a staple in fighting game nights.</p><p>I did go back to check out Soul Edge, but it didn't have the magic of Soul Caliber.  Soul Caliber was fast and had tons of Single Player modes.</p><p>I was super excited when Namco announced Soul Caliber II, and EVEN more ecstatic when Link was announced as a playable character!  I would look at <a xhref="http://www.the-magicbox.com/" title="http://www.the-magicbox.com/"The Magic Box</a> and <a xhref="http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/" title="http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/">Game Watch</a> every single day hoping for new information and whenever something came up, I would summarize the info on the SPAMM forum.  What characters were announced, which characters were returning, which were new.</p><p>In March 2003, I bought the import copy of Soul Caliber II on Gamecube.  I played it a bit, but no one really seemed to care.  It didn't have the caliber of the previous version since it was spread across all 3 consoles, Gamecube, Playstation 2 and Xbox.  People bickered which version was the true version.  People banned the console-specific characters because they were over-powered.  The Soul Caliber community no longer had the unity that brought them together in the beginning.</p><p>Soul Caliber III was lost in the fold for me.  It was only on Playstation 2, but it didn't have the arcade release to fine-tune the console release.  It was the first Soul Caliber to be released on a console ahead of the arcade game, and that just felt completely wrong to me.  It felt like an untuned, unrefined Soul Caliber game..  Not really the next step in the Soul Caliber series.  I've only played it once to this day, but I was happy that I could still hold my own with Kilik. ^_^</p><p><b>This week</b>, Soul Caliber IV comes to the next-gen Consoles with console-specific characters, once again.  I really didn't care about this at all, but after thinking back on my fond Soul Caliber memories.  I kinda want to get into it again.  Soul Caliber IV feels like a leap for the series into the HD era, so I kinda want to be a part of Soul Caliber again.</p><p>However, there's plenty of reasons that keep me from buying it.  First Off, which one do I buy?  I'd almost rather get the Playstation 3 game.  But, if any of my friends get it, they'll probably get the Xbox version and I wouldn't be able to play against them online.  Second Off, it's 60 friggen dollars.  Soul Caliber may have been my go to game in the past, but I doubt I'm going to play it more than 30 minutes without turning it off for something else.</p><p>The character creator sounds fun, but probably won't keep my interest.  I bought that Spore Creature Creator, but felt overwhelmed.  There was too much to do in there, and I couldn't get my creature to look like what I wanted.</p><p>Overall, Soul Caliber is my favorite fighting game of all time, but my history with it is in the past.  I dunno...  is anyone else going to buy Soul Caliber III on Playstation 3?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MGS4 Development" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mgs4-development">MGS4 Development</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I bought something rather frivolous.  When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Opera in the Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/opera-in-the-park">Opera in the Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

At the end of the night, they announced that over 13,000 people were there which is pretty incredible.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1721.webp" /></p><p>The event started around 8pm and went on into the night.  The first two songs that began with I had heard in one form or another before hand, but had never heard the actual song.  Largo al factotum (the figaro song) and Anvil Chorus I remember from Looney Tunes. ^_^  The figaro song is also usually heard in commercials too.  Usually spaghetti sauce commercials.  I think it's kinda funny that the height of my opera experience was from other forms of media using it either poorly or commercially, but at least I had some exposure to it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1726.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was the perfect day for laying in the park listening to some fantastic music. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080726_opera/IMG_1724.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Madama Butterfly</b></div><p>Despite not knowing anything about Opera, there is one opera that I know of thanks to Asian American Literature at Platteville and that is Madama Butterfly.  I think we read the original short story, Madame Butterfly, the opera was based on.  It was rather brief, but gave us the background needed to start reading M. Butterfly, which is a play inspired by the book.</p><p>Madame Butterfly is about a Japanese Geisha woman in Nagasaki known to her friends as Butterfly.  She meets an US sailor, Pinkerton, who's ship is in town.  They fall in love and get married, but Pinkerton must return to the states.  The main emotion of the story is Butterfly's longing and loyality to Pinkerton as she continues to work as a Geisha   She continues to wait and wait and wait for his return, despite her friends constantly telling her that he's never going to return.  That he doesn't love her and it was just a little fling for him.  She continues to believe in Pinkerton.  AND.. Many twists and turns happen when Pinkerton finally returns to Nagasaki.</p><p>M. Butterfly is an interesting parallel tale of love between the actors who portrey the characters in a similar opera featuring cross-dressing and John Lithgow.</p><p>Anywho, Madama Butterfly is being performed by the Madison Opera in November!  I'm totally going.  I think I'll try to read the books again beforehand.  They also have a preview/lecture about the play a week before that'll probably be interesting, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Protomen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-protomen">The Protomen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Comedy is the only genre where lyrics are the focal point, but in other genres, the lyrics are basically there to mask the poor music performance going on behind the singer.  Lyrics give you a biased opinion of what the song is supposed to about, rather than having the song relay that message on its own.  You should be able to dip into the music like a pool of emotion and float along with everyone else.</p><p>This is why I hate nearly all music.  As a kid, I hated Pop and Rock..  I couldn't stand it.  It just sounded like a bunch of noise with no cohesion and poorly crafted lyrics that were inaudible.  Some of my friends started getting me into Electronica which built itself on repetition, layers and absolutely no lyrics in the way..  It was the first time I actually started listening to music, rather than just hearing it.</p><p>After understanding music a little more, lyrics are still pretty annoying, but work incredibly well with some songs.  Electronica is historically known for having the worst written lyrics, but they're always easier to learn.  Then you can add your own noise to the aural atmosphere.  You are right there with the singer and everyone else chanting the lyrics.  The lyrics are generally strategically placed in the song to build on the mood rather than tell you how to feel.</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics aren't that bad</b></div><p>The Protomen is a metal/garage rock opera.  It's a 38 minute story in 7 parts that <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen-frequency" title="/the-protomen-frequency">I wrote about before</a>.  It tells of Protoman's epic struggle and death, and Megaman's rise to follow in his footsteps and eventually confront him circa Megaman 3.</p><p>Each lyric is a sentence of the story that serves telling this story and flowing in harmony with the guitars, keyboards and drums.  The lyrics are another instrument in this symphony that is not more or less important than another.  I've rarely heard lyrics used this way before. ^_^  Maybe that's because the lyrics are telling a story with an overall emotion rather than constantly explaining that emotion.</p><p>Anywho.. Check them out if you get a chance.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lake Delton" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lake-delton">Lake Delton</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was just like walking on a beach.  There was a bit of a stream running through the sand.  I took off my sandals, rolled up my pant legs and walked around in the water a little bit to get some close up pictures.  The water was cool compared to the warmed up sands.</p><p>However, I was incredibly careful...  The entire time I was thinking about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc">this youtube video</a> and another video of a guy sinking in mud or quicksand really fast and completely vanished.  I thought of these when I was slowing sinking in the sand while walking in the water, but it hadn't happened the entire time out there.  Until, I stopped thinking about it...  and sunk down past my knees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't running or anything, so I was right near the edge of the solid sandy surface and the mud pit, so pulling myself out was pretty easy.  The whole time I kept slowing sinking down and kept saying to myself, "stop stop stop stop stop...  holy crap."  Luckily I had already taken my sandals off or I probably would've had to buy new ones.  Though my sandals probably kept my "afloat" longer having a larger area to step on rather than the thin area my feet cover.</p><p>I didn't stray too far from shore after that. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, Lake Delton is pretty screwed..  It probably looked like hell after it initially drained with all the dead fish corpses and more perilous mud pits.  There's a new article today that said crews are beginning to repair the dam this week, so it might be fixed by next year.  I wonder what it'll look like in winter.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/51">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/49">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
