| May 28, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Though, I'm pretty sure I didn't go to the right places..</p><p>Akihabara was one of the top places on my itinerary for Tokyo.  Worldwide, it is known as THE hub for Anime, Video Games and all things electronic.  Almost every store sold new and used video games, music, movies, anime, electronics, toys, and just about anything geeks like us would buy.  You'd think it'd be heaven, right?</p><p>Yeah, it's great if you're trying to find something relatively new.  But searching for rare or uncommon video games is pointless.  I visited about 30 game stores along Chuodori and in the alleyways around there and each store had the same problem..  Overexposure.</p><p>So many goddamn people visit Akihabara that any amount of selection had already been picked over by thousands of people that day.  Every store I visited had wall-to-wall people.  I could hardly even more through the aisles, let alone, stay in one place long enough to actually give an exhaustive search.</p><p>Also, because of the centralized location and massive worldwide acclaim of the area, real estate is tight.  Every store is smaller than your average Mall Gamestop and holds about 3 times the product.  Most stores do have multiple floors though, but they generally keep games to one floor, Anime to another floor, and buy counters to another.</p><p class='img'><b>Yodobashi</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" /></p><p>My first location was Akihabara's Yodobashi Camera.  Yodobashi is THE premiere electronic department store in Japan.  I can't really think of a good analogy..  It's kinda like the FAO Shwartz of electronics?  Except not snobby.  Their Gashapon Aisles were impressive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3346.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3346.webp" /></p><p>I bought a couple toys for Jess Roqs, but that's about it.  The toy section was kinda boring and expensive.  So was their game section.  Their game section did have a neat little diorama for Gyakuten Kenji, which was released TODAY in Japan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3348.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3348.webp" /></p><p>Ultimately, I left this massive building unsatisfied...</p><p class='img'><b>Gamers</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" /></p><p>Exiting Akiba station and heading west to Chuodori, the first major store you see is Gamers (pictured above from across the street.)  As I stood cramped in a boring corner of Gamers waiting for someone to move so I could stop looking at the N64 games, I said to myself, "ya know, if there were an earthquake, not a single person in this building would exit alive."  Maybe it's not so cramped for Japanese people.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3353.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3353.webp" /></p><p>It was pretty cramped for Japanese girls dressed up in gigantic mascot uniforms, though.  She had to shove her way through everyone just to get to the back of the store.</p><p>Games did have a poster for Evangelion 2.0 in one of its stairwells.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" /></p><p>Besides that, I didn't find anything great inside of Gamers.  Well... I suppose I did find a first print copy of Riz-Zoawd on DS that was packaged with the OST.  Riz-Zoawd is a Japanese RPG based on The Wizard of Oz that uses the Stylus in some weird way.  It's developed by Media Creations (creators of Wild Arms). It looked really interesting.  But I figured that I'd never play it, so I passed.</p><p class='img'><b>Wandering Around</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" /></p><p>Like I mentioned before, Akihabara was fricken packed.  The day I visited was Greenery Day (a national holiday), so that may have been another reason for the crowds.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" /></p><p>Isn't selling the R4 card illegal in Japan?  Note that the sign states that the R4 card does not work with the recently released DSi.  Only works for DS Lite.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" /></p><p>One of the buildings had some girls singing a concert.  It was just a bunch of J-Poppy songs, so I didn't stick around for very long.</p><p class='img'><b>Super Potato</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" /></p><p>When talking about Japanese retro games, Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler, and other <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/my1up?publicUserId=5655917" title="http://www.1up.com/do/my1up?publicUserId=5655917">retronauts</a> always seem to mention their favorite Japanese game store: Super Potato.  So, I made a point to find this place and take a gander.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" /></p><p>Super Potato has 3 floors to its own.  All the merchandise is crammed into floors 3 and 4.  Translating: The 3rd floor has Famicon, Megadrive, Super Famicon, 3DO, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, and NeoGeo games.  The 4th floor has Playstation, Gameboy, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Xbox, Game Watch, Game Music, LSI? and something else.  The 5th floor is their retro arcade.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3368.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3368.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3368.webp" /></p><p>Their selection was quite vast, but they didn't have any decent Dreamcast games :/.  Oh well, Super Potato prides itself on Famicon and Super Famicon games.</p><div class='title'><b>Mandarake</b></div><p>My final point of interest was Mandarake.  Every piece of merchandise in Mandarake was purchased from actual people.  They have no distribution lines of merchandise, no regular products.  Hundreds of people line up every day to sell their crap to Mandarake, and Mandarake puts a price tag on it.  And it doesn't have to be an official product either.</p><p>Mandarake is particularly notable for carrying Doujinshi, which are self-published works.  Most of which are Manga, and ALSO most of which are either Yaoi (which is guy on guy action specifically catering towards a female audience) or straight-up Hentai (anime pornography) of popular anime/game characters.</p><p>I've found some fantastic things at the Fukuoka and Nakano Mandarake branches, but the Akihabara branch suffered the same problems as all the other stores in Akiba.  It was very cramped and had poor selection.  Though, they did have Cosmic Smash on Dreamcast for $46.  They also had a copy of Border-down on Dreamcast for $96, which is the cheapest I've found it for...  I didn't buy either.</p><div class='title'><b>That's it</b></div><p>Unfortunately, that was really all that I visited.  I probably should have visited the Anime Radio station and the Akihabara UDX, but I was getting very discouraged on my hunt for video games.  The only thing I bought in Akihabara were a couple of Capsule Toys and Doki Doki Majo Shinpan.  Every store I visited was just another dead end search for spiffy games.</p><p>Overexposure definitely makes Akihabara horrible for game shopping.  If you want to find great games, you need to find the friendly neighborhood game stores that only the locals go to.  As I <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition" title="/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition">mentioned yesterday</a>, that Geo North West of Shinjuku was amazing.  I found Ketsui and Project Justice for quite a cheap price.</p><p>In fact, I came across a couple dudes sifting through Playstation games and writing down prices on this very intricate printed out spread sheet.  Pricing and searching for games in Akihabara is pointless.  Be prepared to do a little more traveling if you actually want to make money buying Japanese games and putting them on ebay.  I've come across full boxed copies of Chrono Trigger and Seiken Densetsu 2 for as little as $5 in places you wouldn't think to look.</p><p>Anyways, the Over-hyped popularity of Akihabara is what disappointed me.  There are better places in Tokyo for this kind of stuff.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Tokyo Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition">Games I buy: Tokyo Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 27, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While in Tokyo, Japan, I spent some time shopping for games, which is something I generally do whenever I'm in a new area.  Whether I'm returning home to Minneapolis, visiting my friend in Tampa, Florida, or flying overseas to Japan, I'll find the locations of the Used game stores and try to visit each one.</p><p>I'm not searching for anything in Particular.  I generally browse their selection and check prices for all of their stock.  Occasionally, I'll come across a game or a price that sets off some alarm bells in my head.  "Wow, they have a copy of Dragon Force on Saturn.  Sweet."..  "Holy crap, Psychonauts on PS2 for $20?!"</p><p>While I'm still in the US, I'll pull out my cellphone and check the price against what is listed on Half.com.  If there's more than a $15 gap in favor of the game I found, I'll buy it and list it on Half.com when I get home.  But, if it's a game I'd be interested in playing sometime in the future, I'll probably buy it anyways.</p><p>These days, I haven't bought a whole lot of new games because I have almost everything I want.  Or I feel that I have too much and should stop buying games.</p><p>That's not the case in Japan.  In Japan, used games for retro consoles are pretty cheap, so when I come across a game with Gem-like qualities, I'll buy it.  And such is the case with every game on this list, except this first one.</p><p class='img'><b>PS3/Bluray - Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete</b> 1st Edition<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" /></p><p>Though, Advent Children Complete really isn't a game.  The 1st Edition release contained the demo for Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.  I decided to buy it because Square has no plans to release a disc version of the demo in North America.  And the Advent Children Complete film is entirely in english.  Or, at least, subtitled.</p><p>I figured the "1st Edition" might be difficult to come by since it's a first edition.  But, Square saw fit to produce nearly 2 million first editions of this set, so this product was everywhere.  Every store I went to had copies of Advent Children Complete.  Most used stores even had it.  In fact, Yamada Lavi in Shibuya, which is where I bought it, actually had their copies discounted to around $52.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - English of the Dead</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" /></p><p>While browsing game stores in Shinjuku, I came across English of the Dead for the DS at a Softmap.  I was instantly entranced by the sheer concept and the throwback to Typing of the Dead for Dreamcast.  It's basically the same game!  Instead of typing out words to kill zombies, you translate Kanji into English.  What a perfect vehicle to learn more Kanji!  Instant Purchase.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" /></p><p>I found this game at a Trader located in Akihabara for a mere $20!  For those who don't know, the Doki Doki Majo Shinpan is a dating sim sort of game where you must determine whether or not underaged school girls are witches.  In order to make that determination you must touch and grope these girls with the DS Stylus.  Take a look at this video for a demonstration: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw</a></p><p>The first Doki Doki Majo Shinpan was release in 2007 and prompted much internet humor.  In 2008, SNK released this follow-up that was rated even higher on their Adult-content scale.</p><p>Anyways, $20 is pretty cheap for one of the more bizarre Japanese DS releases.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Ketsui Death Label</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" /></p><p>This is one of the rarest DS games to date.  Ketsui is a "bullet-hell" shooter made by Cave.  It was released in limited run and contained a DVD with video of professionals running through the game perfectly.  I found Ketsu when I started doing my serious game hunting during my trip.  It was only $46 at Geo in North West Shinjuku.  $46 is an excellent price considering it goes for 2 to 3 times that on ebay.</p><p class='img'><b>Dreamcast - Project Justice</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3671.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3671.webp" /></p><p>That Geo was an untapped vein of gold.  I also found Project Justice for only $26!  Another game that sells for over $100 on ebay.</p><p>Project Justice is the 2000/2001 follow-up to Rival Schools released on Playstation.  Rival Schools was one of Capcom's first truly successful 3D fighters (if not THE first).  The sequel refines all the early 3D hiccups and is a fantastic polished product.</p><p class='img'><b>Playstation 2 -

Ikaruga</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3670.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3670.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3670.webp" /></p><p>Shooters on the Dreamcast aren't too difficult to come by, but they are very difficult to come by cheap.  Shooters are what have kept the Dreamcast alive way WAY past it's expiration date.  The Dreamcast basically died in 2002 in both America and Japan.  But thanks to the Naomi Arcade hardware (which was a Dreamcast), arcade perfect console ports kept the Dreamcast alive until just two years ago with the release of Trigger Heart Exellica (also available on XBLA).</p><p>I wrote a bit about it in these two lengthy posts: <a href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast" title="/end-gen-dreamcast">http://theschlock.com/blog/?p=129</a> and <a href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2" title="/end-gen-dreamcast-2">http://theschlock.com/blog/?p=128</a></p><p>Ikaruga was released on the Dreamcast in 2002 and was a perfect port from it's Naomi Arcade brother.  But would become obscure by its niche genre and dying console.  Ikaruga became hugely popular in the underground gaming scene when it was released on the Gamecube and brought over to America in 2003.  It was still niche, but it was finally playable on an American console!</p><p>I love this game. ^_^  It's one of <a href="/old/v7/your-20-favorite-games-of-all-time" title="/your-20-favorite-games-of-all-time">my top 20 games of all time</a> (which needs to be updated).  It's one of those games that found the perfect balance between difficulty, gameplay and game design.</p><p>I've seen copies of the Dreamcast Ikaruga in Japanese stores for $100+ before, but this was the first time I came across a used copy.  It was only $36!  I don't care if it's opened, I want to play it!</p><p>Now I just need to find a cheap copy of Border Down.</p><p class='img'><b>DS -

| May 26, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About 3 months ago, I saw a movie entitled <b>Run Fat Boy Run</b> starring and written by Simon Pegg and also written by Michael Ian Black.</p><p>Simon Pegg's character is slightly depressed and had gained a bit of weight since he left he fiance at the alter five years ago.  Now his fiance is dating Hank Azaria who is one of those guys that is good at everything.  Hank Azaria is fit and healthy and plans to run the London Marathon is a couple of months.  Not to be out done by the likes of him, Simon Pegg vows to run the marathon, too.</p><p>The "comedy" of this movie is how a lazy dude like Simon Pegg gets in shape for the marathon.  And the "development" of his character is what he learns on the way.  His friends are supportive and pitch in to point Simon Pegg back on the healthy track of life.</p><p>Overall, I thought the movie used a lot of tired jokes, relied too much on physical humor and wasn't very original.  One thing was very clear in the movie, though.  For Simon Pegg, running the marathon would ultimately solved all his problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Hmmm...  solved all his problems, eh?</b></div><p>Maybe I'm a little too impressionable by movies and video games, but the cogs of thought started spinning around in my head.</p><p>First off, distances on foot really don't intimidate me.  While living in Japan, I walked up the side of a mountain almost everyday to get to school.  Also, when the bus sees fit to leave downtown without me, I've walked the 3.5 miles to work without a problem.</p><p>Ok, 26 miles is kinda far, but a 13 mile half marathon?  I could easily traverse that.</p><p>Secondly, I need some manor of exercise in my life.  Walking everywhere is nice, but it's no where near a full workout.  DDR is too inconvenient at my apartment and there are no machines nearby.  I don't really like biking.  I like running around the neighborhood, but I lack the motivation.</p><p>I figure that signing up for a marathon would give me the motivation to stick with a regular routine of running/jogging and provide some actually exercise in my life.</p><p>Those 2 reasons were why I signed up for the Madison Half Marathon.  It sounded easy and would get me to exercise.  To clinch my dedication to the race, I asked Dave if he'd run the marathon with me.  He's also looking for excuses to exercise.</p><p>We estimated our finish time at <b>3 hours 1 second</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Training</b></div><p>In Run Fat Boy Run, Simon Pegg has 3 months to get in shape before the London Full Marathon.  My time was a little bit shorter than that.  I had 9 weeks after I signed up.  That really didn't bother me though.  I wasn't going to delude myself into thinking that I could keep a running pace during the entire thing.  I was quite certain that I would be walking the better part of the race.</p><p>That was pretty much my pace during training.  Run run run until I ran out of breath, walk until I caught my breath, then run run run again.  On, off, on off.  Every time I went jogging, my initial run would get longer and longer.  My goal was to get to the point where I'd be able to make it through the entire course without walking.  I was able to run nearly 75% of my 1.5 mile course before I expanded it to 3.4 miles.</p><p>Run run run.  I got slightly better each time.  A minute faster here, a minute faster there.</p><p>Previously I gave up running after a week because I wasn't feeling any different.  After a month of running around, I wasn't starting to feel some of the benefits.  My energy was up and my thighs were as lean as they were in my DDR haydays.  I didn't lose much weight, but I probably could if I changed my diet slightly.</p><div class='title'><b>"Running" the marathon</b></div><p>The day finally came.  Sunday morning, at 7am, Dave and I drove to the Alliant Energy Center, safety-pinned our numbers to our shirts, and lined up at the starting line with 3700 other people.  Gawd, it was freezing outside.  It was around 55 degrees and all we had on were these running shorts and a shirt.</p><p>But after the starting horn was bleeted and we ran consistently for about 2 miles, the cold weather was perfect.  Run, walk, run, walk, run, walk longer, run, walk longer.  Much like I figured, the half marathon wasn't difficult.  It was only 4 times the length of what I had done during training.</p><p>During the race, Dave and I chatted about other upcoming marathons.  We agreed that a Full Marathon is a too far for us for now, but were definitely interested in more Half Marathons.</p><p>The course for the Half Marathon was quite pretty. ^_^  It took us all over Madison, from Monona Bay, to St. Mary's Hospital, to Camp Randall, to the Agriculture area of UWMadison.  We went along the coastline of Lake Mendota, to Memorial Union.  Along Langdon St to James Madison Park up to Tenney Park, where we turned South East.  We went underneath East Washington and turned South West along Jenifer St.  From there, we met up with John Nolen Dr. and followed the coast of Lake Monona back to the Colliseum.  If you want a great tour of Madison, this Marathon is perfect.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>We screwed up our timing chips, so Dave and I don't have official results, but I remembered what the clock said when I passed the finish line.</p><p>I finished the Half Marathon at <b>2 hours 49 minutes and 56 seconds</b>.  And Dave finished about 10 seconds later.  Overall, we placed around 3450 out of 3700.  Whooo!  Not last.</p><p>Unlike Simon Pegg, the Marathon didn't solve all my problems.  But It definitely gave me the motivation to keep with an exercise routine.  Something that I've wanted for a while now.</p><p>Plus, I got a medal!  Yeah yeah, everyone gets a medal.  But it's more than a medal of participation, it's a medal of completion.  It's also more than just completing the marathon, it's also the 2 months of work I've put into myself leading up to the Marathon.  For the first time since college, I've actually lost some weight, rather than hovering around the same numbers.  I have more energy.  There's that feeling of accomplishment, too.</p><p>I worked out for 2 months, ran/walked further than I had at a given point in time, and got a medal for it!  Hot damn!  All because of a stupid movie.</p><p>Thanks Simon Pegg and Michael Ian Black ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>2:49:56 is a start.  And it's pretty good for first-timers + only 2 months of training.  But, hell, we can definitely do better.  I was 6th from last for my age group.</p><p>Dave and I signed up for 2 more Half Marathons this year.  The <a href="http://www.madisonminimarathon.com" title="http://www.madisonminimarathon.com">Madison Mini-Marathon</a> and the <a href="http://www.foxcitiesmarathon.org" title="http://www.foxcitiesmarathon.org">Fox Cities Half Marathon</a>.</p><p>The Madison Mini-Marathon course is another great introduction to some of the areas of Madison.  It actually goes up to Capitol Square, and then continues all the way down to Lake Wingra and back again.  It starts 7am on Saturday August 29th.</p><p>The Fox Cities Marathon starts in Appleton, goes through Mensha and ends in Neenah.  Should be interesting. ^_^ That one is 7am on Sunday September 20th.</p><p>Maybe next year, we'll have the strength to complete an actual Full Marathon.  Baby steps.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Indianapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/indianapolis">Indianapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

until the night before to do everything.  On Wednesday Night, I bought better insoles for my shoes, packed clothing, packed other stuff, paid rent, processed all my old photos still on my camera, watched Rescue Me.  I could have easily done this stuff on Tuesday, but decided to wait for I don't know why.</p><p>As such I got to bed around Midnight.  I wanted to get a good night's rest before my 8am flight, but It was not in the cards.  I had to wake up around 5:15am and get outside to catch a bus at 5:52 to head to the airport.  A transfer here, a transfer there, and I was at the airport.  A timely arrival didn't really matter though, since Chicago thunderstorms delayed my flight out of Madison about 2 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>O'hare</b></div><p>Eventually, I made it to Chicago with well enough time to catch my Narita flight.  So much time, in fact, that I walked around the airport.</p><p class='img'><img

what I see of O'hare is construction, or concrete walls.  The International flight areas is really pretty.  The corridor connecting Terminals B and C is underground and has rainbow lights that flicker along to classical music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" loading="lazy"

time.  I boarded the plane, sat in my seat, and off we went to Narita.  I choose the very last window seat on the left side of the plane: 61B.  Which was great in theory.  There was no one behind me to kick my seat!  However, directly behind me was a semi-open area for people to stand and stretch.  So I only slept a couple times, and 20 minutes at time for that matter.</p><p>The pilot was pretty efficient.  We got to Narita 20 minutes ahead of schedule!  However, that didn't make any difference.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The Japanese Health Administration was set into Panic mode thanks to the Swine Flu and EVERY incoming human to Japan had to be "Quarantined".  We sat on the plane for an additional 2 hours after our 12 hour flight for Health officials to board the plane and have us take an additional customs survey about our health.</p><p>One-by-one passenger-by-passenger they would receive our survey process it and then decide that we're OK.</p><p class='img'><img

ridiculousness.  Everyone sat in their seat and waited.  I was probably the only one on the plane that didn't have a connecting flight, too.  We arrived at Narita around 2:20pm and I finally got off the plane around 4:15pm.  It's been about 21 hours since I've got any actual sleep.</p><div class='title'><b>Shibuya</b></div><p>The Narita Express took me directly to Shibuya where I plan on staying for my whole trip.  The second that I got off the train I started walking in the direction I thought was correct but was not.  I joked that I was totally get lost walking around Tokyo, but I didn't think I would get lost so early in my Journey.  Once I found a city map, I was turned toward the right direction.</p><p>The Hotel I planned on staying at was actually a Love Hotel.  I guess that's what I get for last minute research.  There was an actual hotel right around the corner though.  So I checked in, got in my room and finally went to sleep around 7:30pm (24 hours since I woke up at 5:15am in Madison).<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to To purchase a DSi?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/to-purchase-a-dsi">To purchase a DSi?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2 weeks ago Nintendo released the third generation of the Nintendo DS entitled the DSi. The DSi doesn't iterate on the visual design of the DS Lite, but makes several hardware changes. The screens are slightly bigger and brighter. The speakers are more clear. The power button has moved. They've also added 2 low quality cameras for some reason.</p><p>But the biggest change is the removal of the Gameboy Slot on the bottom of the unit. It's sad that nearly 20 years after the original release of the Gameboy that that name will no longer carried. But oh well.. It's been a very long time since I've even used that slot for games.</p><p>With removal of the GBA slot comes the addition of an SD card slot. The SD slot is located on the side where the power button used to be. The primary purchase for this is to store downloadable games and applications from the DSi store, which opened on the same day of the DSi launch.</p><div class='title'><b>Is it worth it?</b></div><p>Yes, yes, all these features are all well and good but does this really warrant a purchase? There's a little bit more processor power, and a little bit bigger screens. But essentially the DSi is identical to the DS Lite. There's no killer-app on the DSi store and no plans for DSi specific games. Why waste $170 buying a new DS?</p><p>Well, my reason for wanting a DSi is the same reason a few others are willing to "upgrade": My DS is beat to shit. I own a launch Japanese DS and over these past 3 years my DS has been my most played gaming platform. I've played the thing so much the touch screen can no longer be re-calibrated to precision. Those super-market credit card signature pads have more precision than my DS touch screen. Trauma Center is unplayable!</p><p>In addition, there's been a tiny renaissance of games lately. (ie: Pokemon Platinum, Tokyo Beat Down, Docomo Dake, Retro Game Challenge, Harry Hatsworth.) There's also a few future titles to look forward to. (ie: Edgeworth Perfect Prosecutor and Zelda Train Simulator.) There's also some great games from the past year that I missed. (ie: Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Trauma Center 2, Bangaioh Spirits.)</p><p>I think an upgrade to workable DS hardware isn't such a bad idea.</p><div class='title'><b>Region locking</b></div><p>Up until now, all Nintendo portable hardware was region free. You can play any Japanese games on an American DS and vice versa. But Nintendo had announced that the Nintendo DSi is region locked. What does that actually mean, though?</p><p>Well, for #1: The Japanese DSi will only have access to the Japanese DSi store. Americans can only access the American store. I think that was already obvious given the way the Wii store works. Unlike Xbox or PSN, the region is embedded in the device itself. So the only way to access a store outside of your region is the purchase the device for that region.</p><p>Pros: Access to kooky Japanese games not available in the US. Games like the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html">Katamari Puzzle</a> game, which may or may not actually be fun. The Art Style series which includes <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html">Decode</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html">Pico Pict</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html">Somnium</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html">Hacolife</a>, and a couple others. These games remind me a lot of Bit Generations. The Dr. Mario games is over there too.</p><p>Cons: I won't have access to the American games. Though, I don't really see this as much of a Con since the games I care about will already be on the Japanese DSi store.</p><p>#2: DSi Region locking could also mean that DSi specific cartridge based games are un-playable on other regioned devices. Though, this hasn't actually been confirmed since Nintendo has not mentioned any plans of making DSi specific games. However, if they did plan to make DSi specific games, and they were region locked than I would not be able to play American games.</p><p>#3: DLC. Let's say cartridges were not region locked and they were some DSi-only cartridge games. Well, if Nintendo introduced DLC for these titles, it wouldn't be able to access the store for my American games. Though, are there any games for Wii that have DLC?</p><div class='title'><b>Do I buy import?</b></div><p>Personally, I'm going to bet on DSi-only carts being region-free, even though I really have no proof to back that up. That's a problem for future-Me anyways, since all current DS software is region free.</p><p>The decision of whether I buy domestic or import comes to down to the DSi store. It's hard to judge the American DSi store after a mere two weeks of operation, but there are definitely some Japanese games that will never be released here.</p><p>So, I think I will buy a Japanese DSi. They are $20 more expensive than the US ones and come in a few colors not available in the US including <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html">Pink, Navy and Lime</a>.</p><p>In 10 days, I leave for Japan. When I'm over there I'll either chose a Navy or Lime one. Who knows, though. I might change my mind while I'm in Japan. Or I might not be able to find any. $200 can always buy something else.</p><p>That's not the only thing on my shopping list: <a href="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html" title="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html">http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion Dammit" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit">Evangelion Dammit</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 15, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>How long ago was Evangelion 1.0 released in theaters?  I think it was around July 2007, wasn't it?  Even so, it's been out for a while.  And you'd think a die hard, unapologetic Evangelion fan such as myself would have seen it by now.  But I have not.  I guess I thought I was going to have or attend some big group watching Party with friends to see the rebirth, but that never happened.  At this point, I figured that the North American Bluray release would finally be the time I'd see it.  Funimation is releasing it in November 2009.</p><p>Anyways, this weekend was the first free weekend I've had for a while now.  So far on this lazy Saturday my accomplishments include: Watching the 5 most recent episodes of Late Night w/ Jimmy Fallon and sleeping on and off for about 12 or 14 hours.  As I ran out of Jimmy Fallon episodes to watch and read Eva fans going nuts over <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65" title="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65">Asuka's name change</a>, I thought about finally watching Evangelion 1.0.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 1: Finding a torrent</b></div><p>Finding a torrent for Evangelion 1.0 wasn't too difficult.  Though, my choices of which torrent to use was varied and confusing.  I finally picked one that had a decent amount of seeders and looked like an English language version.  It took about an hour or two to download.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 2: Playing the movie</b></div><p>The file I downloaded was a Matroska (MKV) file.  One of those ridiculous video formats that Anime geeks like because you can swap out subtitle files at your whim.  I thought I had means to play MKV files, but Media Player and DivX Player informed me that this was not the case.  <a href="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html" title="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html">Matroska dot Org</a> had the answers for me.  I downloaded a copy of Media Player Classic, and the video played perfectly. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 3: Subtitles</b></div><p>The torrent was kind enough to provide only the movie file.  So, when Shinji listened to the phone recording in the first moments of the film, it was in Japanese without the aid of subtitles.  It only took about 10 minutes of searching on Google to find a subtitle file.  (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf" title="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf">http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf</a>).  I opened up Evangelion 1.0 in Media Player Classic, set the subtitle file, and prepared to watch.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 4: Correcting the Subtitle file</b></div><p>Not every video file of Evangelion 1.0 is the same.  Some are recorded from a Camcorder in the theater.  Some are directly ripped from the DVD release.  Whatever the case, my copy of Evangelion 1.0 has about 32 seconds of Company IDs at the beginning before the film actually begins, which the subtitle file doesn't take into account.  So, Subtitles start to appear 32 seconds before any dialogue is said.</p><p>The whole beauty of the MKV format is that you can make your own subtitle files.  The subtitles aren't hardcoded on the video.  You can edit them.  So, I'll just fix the subtitle file by changing every time in it.  I'd do it by hand, except there are over 1000 lines of dialogue to change.  I could write a program much faster than I could do fix by hand.  Plus, it would be much more interesting.</p><p>So, that's what I did.  Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java">github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/EvaSubtitleFixer.java</a>.  If you want to use it, feel free. ^_^  You might want to change the ORIGINAL_LOCATION to whatever your subtitle file is called.  And change OFFSET_BY_SECONDS to however many seconds your subtitle file is off.  It'll plop a file called subtitles_fixes.srt in your C directory.</p><p>I guess this'll really only work with Subtitle files of the srt format.  I'm not sure how the other subtitle formats are designed.  I just took one look at the SRT file and figured out the pattern instantly.</p><p><i>Update: I wrote that code in a web application, so you can use it right now without needing any compilers or experience or whatever.  The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a></p><div class='title'><b>Success</b></div><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-2">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dexter Discussion Spoiler Free!</b></div><p>I just finished watching Season 1 of Dexter for the second time. It's quite incredible. The suspense is perfectly controlled leading to the finale. It builds from the little bits of plot and story peppered in the beginning and gradually mounting an explosion in the end.</p><p>Season 2 really doesn't quite compare. Though, it tries to do the same thing. And has a pretty decent starting point with the aftermath of Season 1. It does a great job of building off the previous season and builds a story of its own, which also leads to a great ending. Unfortunately, the main focus is split.</p><p>Season 1 has a very clear focal point that everything centers on. There are 2 main plots that eventually weave together into one. Season 2 has a focal point, but there is too much plot. And just a little bit of story. Thankfully it's masked but consistant suspense.</p><p>Season 2 is still decent, but Season 1 is great.</p><p>Don't talk to me about Season 3.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/51">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/49">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
