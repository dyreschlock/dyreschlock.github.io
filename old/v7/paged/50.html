| April 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2 weeks ago Nintendo released the third generation of the Nintendo DS entitled the DSi. The DSi doesn't iterate on the visual design of the DS Lite, but makes several hardware changes. The screens are slightly bigger and brighter. The speakers are more clear. The power button has moved. They've also added 2 low quality cameras for some reason.</p><p>But the biggest change is the removal of the Gameboy Slot on the bottom of the unit. It's sad that nearly 20 years after the original release of the Gameboy that that name will no longer carried. But oh well.. It's been a very long time since I've even used that slot for games.</p><p>With removal of the GBA slot comes the addition of an SD card slot. The SD slot is located on the side where the power button used to be. The primary purchase for this is to store downloadable games and applications from the DSi store, which opened on the same day of the DSi launch.</p><div class='title'><b>Is it worth it?</b></div><p>Yes, yes, all these features are all well and good but does this really warrant a purchase? There's a little bit more processor power, and a little bit bigger screens. But essentially the DSi is identical to the DS Lite. There's no killer-app on the DSi store and no plans for DSi specific games. Why waste $170 buying a new DS?</p><p>Well, my reason for wanting a DSi is the same reason a few others are willing to "upgrade": My DS is beat to shit. I own a launch Japanese DS and over these past 3 years my DS has been my most played gaming platform. I've played the thing so much the touch screen can no longer be re-calibrated to precision. Those super-market credit card signature pads have more precision than my DS touch screen. Trauma Center is unplayable!</p><p>In addition, there's been a tiny renaissance of games lately. (ie: Pokemon Platinum, Tokyo Beat Down, Docomo Dake, Retro Game Challenge, Harry Hatsworth.) There's also a few future titles to look forward to. (ie: Edgeworth Perfect Prosecutor and Zelda Train Simulator.) There's also some great games from the past year that I missed. (ie: Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Trauma Center 2, Bangaioh Spirits.)</p><p>I think an upgrade to workable DS hardware isn't such a bad idea.</p><div class='title'><b>Region locking</b></div><p>Up until now, all Nintendo portable hardware was region free. You can play any Japanese games on an American DS and vice versa. But Nintendo had announced that the Nintendo DSi is region locked. What does that actually mean, though?</p><p>Well, for #1: The Japanese DSi will only have access to the Japanese DSi store. Americans can only access the American store. I think that was already obvious given the way the Wii store works. Unlike Xbox or PSN, the region is embedded in the device itself. So the only way to access a store outside of your region is the purchase the device for that region.</p><p>Pros: Access to kooky Japanese games not available in the US. Games like the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html">Katamari Puzzle</a> game, which may or may not actually be fun. The Art Style series which includes <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html">Decode</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html">Pico Pict</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html">Somnium</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html">Hacolife</a>, and a couple others. These games remind me a lot of Bit Generations. The Dr. Mario games is over there too.</p><p>Cons: I won't have access to the American games. Though, I don't really see this as much of a Con since the games I care about will already be on the Japanese DSi store.</p><p>#2: DSi Region locking could also mean that DSi specific cartridge based games are un-playable on other regioned devices. Though, this hasn't actually been confirmed since Nintendo has not mentioned any plans of making DSi specific games. However, if they did plan to make DSi specific games, and they were region locked than I would not be able to play American games.</p><p>#3: DLC. Let's say cartridges were not region locked and they were some DSi-only cartridge games. Well, if Nintendo introduced DLC for these titles, it wouldn't be able to access the store for my American games. Though, are there any games for Wii that have DLC?</p><div class='title'><b>Do I buy import?</b></div><p>Personally, I'm going to bet on DSi-only carts being region-free, even though I really have no proof to back that up. That's a problem for future-Me anyways, since all current DS software is region free.</p><p>The decision of whether I buy domestic or import comes to down to the DSi store. It's hard to judge the American DSi store after a mere two weeks of operation, but there are definitely some Japanese games that will never be released here.</p><p>So, I think I will buy a Japanese DSi. They are $20 more expensive than the US ones and come in a few colors not available in the US including <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html">Pink, Navy and Lime</a>.</p><p>In 10 days, I leave for Japan. When I'm over there I'll either chose a Navy or Lime one. Who knows, though. I might change my mind while I'm in Japan. Or I might not be able to find any. $200 can always buy something else.</p><p>That's not the only thing on my shopping list: <a href="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html" title="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html">http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion Dammit" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit">Evangelion Dammit</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 15, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>How long ago was Evangelion 1.0 released in theaters?  I think it was around July 2007, wasn't it?  Even so, it's been out for a while.  And you'd think a die hard, unapologetic Evangelion fan such as myself would have seen it by now.  But I have not.  I guess I thought I was going to have or attend some big group watching Party with friends to see the rebirth, but that never happened.  At this point, I figured that the North American Bluray release would finally be the time I'd see it.  Funimation is releasing it in November 2009.</p><p>Anyways, this weekend was the first free weekend I've had for a while now.  So far on this lazy Saturday my accomplishments include: Watching the 5 most recent episodes of Late Night w/ Jimmy Fallon and sleeping on and off for about 12 or 14 hours.  As I ran out of Jimmy Fallon episodes to watch and read Eva fans going nuts over <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65" title="http://tinyurl.com/bhfk65">Asuka's name change</a>, I thought about finally watching Evangelion 1.0.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 1: Finding a torrent</b></div><p>Finding a torrent for Evangelion 1.0 wasn't too difficult.  Though, my choices of which torrent to use was varied and confusing.  I finally picked one that had a decent amount of seeders and looked like an English language version.  It took about an hour or two to download.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 2: Playing the movie</b></div><p>The file I downloaded was a Matroska (MKV) file.  One of those ridiculous video formats that Anime geeks like because you can swap out subtitle files at your whim.  I thought I had means to play MKV files, but Media Player and DivX Player informed me that this was not the case.  <a href="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html" title="http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html">Matroska dot Org</a> had the answers for me.  I downloaded a copy of Media Player Classic, and the video played perfectly. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 3: Subtitles</b></div><p>The torrent was kind enough to provide only the movie file.  So, when Shinji listened to the phone recording in the first moments of the film, it was in Japanese without the aid of subtitles.  It only took about 10 minutes of searching on Google to find a subtitle file.  (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf" title="http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf">http://tinyurl.com/buqvpf</a>).  I opened up Evangelion 1.0 in Media Player Classic, set the subtitle file, and prepared to watch.</p><div class='title'><b>Obstacle 4: Correcting the Subtitle file</b></div><p>Not every video file of Evangelion 1.0 is the same.  Some are recorded from a Camcorder in the theater.  Some are directly ripped from the DVD release.  Whatever the case, my copy of Evangelion 1.0 has about 32 seconds of Company IDs at the beginning before the film actually begins, which the subtitle file doesn't take into account.  So, Subtitles start to appear 32 seconds before any dialogue is said.</p><p>The whole beauty of the MKV format is that you can make your own subtitle files.  The subtitles aren't hardcoded on the video.  You can edit them.  So, I'll just fix the subtitle file by changing every time in it.  I'd do it by hand, except there are over 1000 lines of dialogue to change.  I could write a program much faster than I could do fix by hand.  Plus, it would be much more interesting.</p><p>So, that's what I did.  Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/blob/master/old/eva/EvaSubtitleFixer.java">github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-website/EvaSubtitleFixer.java</a>.  If you want to use it, feel free. ^_^  You might want to change the ORIGINAL_LOCATION to whatever your subtitle file is called.  And change OFFSET_BY_SECONDS to however many seconds your subtitle file is off.  It'll plop a file called subtitles_fixes.srt in your C directory.</p><p>I guess this'll really only work with Subtitle files of the srt format.  I'm not sure how the other subtitle formats are designed.  I just took one look at the SRT file and figured out the pattern instantly.</p><p><i>Update: I wrote that code in a web application, so you can use it right now without needing any compilers or experience or whatever.  The web-app is located here:</i><br/><a href="/apps/subtitlefixer" title="/apps/subtitlefixer">theschlock.com/app/subtitlefixer</a></p><div class='title'><b>Success</b></div><p>Now, I can finally watch Evangelion 1.0 after a 2 hour download, 10 minutes figuring out how to play it, 10 minutes finding a subtitle file, 40 minutes writing a program to correct it, and another 40 minutes blogging about it.</p><p>Programming is a life skill. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-2">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dexter Discussion Spoiler Free!</b></div><p>I just finished watching Season 1 of Dexter for the second time. It's quite incredible. The suspense is perfectly controlled leading to the finale. It builds from the little bits of plot and story peppered in the beginning and gradually mounting an explosion in the end.</p><p>Season 2 really doesn't quite compare. Though, it tries to do the same thing. And has a pretty decent starting point with the aftermath of Season 1. It does a great job of building off the previous season and builds a story of its own, which also leads to a great ending. Unfortunately, the main focus is split.</p><p>Season 1 has a very clear focal point that everything centers on. There are 2 main plots that eventually weave together into one. Season 2 has a focal point, but there is too much plot. And just a little bit of story. Thankfully it's masked but consistant suspense.</p><p>Season 2 is still decent, but Season 1 is great.</p><p>Don't talk to me about Season 3.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nuka Cola Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nuka-cola-recipe">Nuka Cola Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I had a particular spiffy weekend planned that ended up with way too many foibles and screw-ups.</p><p>My Friday plans ultimately took me to Chicago to see french synth rock band M83.  I left work a little early to board a bus to Milwaukee, meet up with Dave, have some dinner, and drive down to Chicago.  We went to a marvelous Mexican restaurant on the south-side of Milwaukee, went to a couple stores I had wanted to go to, and then headed south down 94.</p><p>M83 were playing at The Bottom Lounge.  A venue that I assumed would be like any other venue I've been to where an electronic genre band would play.  Some 'trendy' place with a constant flow of eletronica music building up to M83's performance.  This was not the case.  The Bottom Lounge was more of an indie rock venue where bands are setup on stage without an interim DJ to streamline to setup and tear down process.</p><p>So when we arrived around 10:30pm, which would've been the perfect build time to the night's headliners and a decent amount of attendance, I was quite perturbed to realize that the 9pm time on the ticket didn't mean "Doors at 9pm", it meant 9pm.  Balls.</p><p>That was a secondary concern, though, considering that M83's performance sold out.  Dave insisted that I, at least, spend my ticket I paid for.  I did.  And 15 minutes later, M83 finished up and tore down their equipment and readied the stage for the next band.  Rather than pay for expensive beer in the "waiting room," we decided to drive around Chicago a little bit and then head home.</p><p>On the plus-side, M83 are fantastic.  Their songs build layer after layer.  Their voices, guitars and sound play in absolute harmony building this strong, powerful, warm aura.  Apparently, M83 were huge earlier in the decade and hadn't produced anything new until this year.  This tour was a slight comeback for their career.  I may have heard some of their music before, but I didn't really know their name until their track appeared on Sasha's Involver 2.  It's one of my favorite tracks on there, so I figured this would be a worthwhile event. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, I completely screwed up that night.  Oh well...<br/>____</p><p>On Saturday, I had a date with a girl I went out with a few times in the past few weeks.  Everything seemed to be going great with her.  We really enjoyed each others company.  But she dumped me because she's busy all the time and doesn't really have time to date.</p><p>On the plus-side, I now know of a Driving Range that's pretty close to my apartment and is open all winter long!<br/>____</p><p>For Sunday, Tony and I had tickets for the Madison Opera's production of Madama Butterfly.  Madama Butterfly is set around Glover Garden in Nagasaki.  Pinkerton, a US Navyman, meets Butterfly, a geisha, while stationed in Nagasaki.  They fall in love, and are wed.  Pinkerton must return to the US, though, and he leaves Butterfly in Japan.  That's the first act.  The second act focuses on Butterfly and her resolve and dedication for Pinkerton.  And in the third act, Pinkerton returns, but not with joyful news.</p><p>MY GOD can opera be boring.  I think one of their larger mistakes was omitting the second intermission with 5 minutes of low-light visual aura and pleasant somber music describing the evening turning into night turning into midnight turning into morning.  I nearly fell asleep at several points.</p><p>I screwed up this event by forgetting the tickets at home by the time we arrived at the parking garage.  We finally got into the overture center 20 minutes after Madama had already begun.  We were able to watch the first act on monitors they had in the waiting room, but the quality was so horrible, you couldn't even read the translation.</p><p>It was certainly interesting to see a production of Madama Butterfly, but the aesthetic of Madama Butterfly is more opera oriented rather than Japanese oriented, so it fell a little flat for me.<br/>____</p><p>Between these failures, I bought a couple new records on Saturday morning and watched a bunch of sad movies on Sunday and now I'm under the weather today for some reason.  Oh well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oiLfTnrC40" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oiLfTnrC40">Marmoset, there'll be days like this.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 35W Construction Complete" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/35w-construction-complete">35W Construction Complete</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Tuesday, Fable II finally is released.  A game that I was once very much looking forward to.  But the more and more of this game I expose myself to, the more and more I cannot bring myself to hand over $60 or $70 dollars to purchase.</p><div class='title'><b>Thinking back to Fable</b></div><p>Fable was one of my favorite original Xbox games.  I have that thought in my head.  I really liked Fable.  But, why did I like Fable?  Oh right.  Because the game was completely ridiculous.  Because the English accents made me laugh every time dialogue was spoken.  Because I ate a bunch of pies and ran around as a huge fat guy.</p><p>I loved it for it's B-movie qualities.  There were plenty of them.  But that's really the extent of Fable's quality.  The game is shallow and tedious, quite frankly.  It made me laugh because it was so moronic.</p><p>Would I pay $60 or $70 to be amused again by the same train wreck?  Hell no.  The memories are fond, but only because the price of entry was trivial.  I think I paid $20 for Fable and It was absolutely worth it.  Another Fable-like experience is not worth the high price of HD gaming.  It's worth $30 at best.</p><div class='title'><b>Playing Fable at PAX</b></div><p>But times change, right?  Peter Moyneux (creator of Fable) has apologized for the mistakes made in Fable and says that he's learned from them.  Fable II is fable done right.  Honestly, there are tons of problems with what I played at The Penny Arcade Expo, if that was representative of the final product: <a href="/old/v7/pax-fable-ii-hands-on" title="/pax-fable-ii-hands-on">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=476</a></p><p>The graphics were horrible.  The speed was slow.  The fighting felt a tad unresponsive.  It also felt more like a hack 'n slash loot fest than an Action RPG.  And that'd be fine if I found it fun to play.  But what I played was boring and derivative.  It took resolve to make it to the end of the demo.  And I'm not going to pay $60 - $70 to play more of that shit.</p><div class='title'><b>The first 10 minutes</b></div><p>Kotaku posted an article today with a video of the first 10 minutes of Fable 2.  Some polish website has a copy of the game committed it to the internet: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish" title="http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish">http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish</a></p><p>That certainly brings back memories from Fable.  The goofy English accents and dim-witted humor.  But after playing Dead Space all weekend long, this feels cheap.  It feels like a joke.  And I'd feel like I'm at the butt of that joke for paying full price.  Dead Space is a fine polished work of atmospheric art.  Fable II looks bargin bin.</p><div class='title'><b>However...</b></div><p>One thing Fable II does have going for it is Online Co-op.  All my friends are interested in this game and have pre-ordered it.  So it gives me the chance to play games with friends!  I'm just going to clear out my gamefly list and have Fable II as the only entry.  That should guarantee that my next game will be Fable II and hopefully my friends haven't beaten the game by the time I get it.</p><p>Hell, If Fable II turns out to be alright.  I can choose the "keep it" option from Gamefly, and it'll only cost me $30, most likely.</p><div class='title'><b>Other upcoming games</b></div><p>As inferred, I bought Dead Space this week and Love it.  This week is Fable II.  Also this week is the new Castlevania on DS.  Next week is Fallout 3.  November 11th is Mirror's Edge!</p><p>I can't wait for Mirror's Edge ^_^.  I wrote about it back on <a href="/old/v7/free-running-game" title="/free-running-game">July 17th</a> during E3 week and then played it on <a href="/old/v7/pax-mirrors-edge-hands-on" title="/pax-mirrors-edge-hands-on">September 1st</a> at PAX.  On November 6th, they will be a demo on both consoles.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock for Sale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-2">Schlock for Sale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 18, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At work, my ears have a lot of free time. My eyes, my hands and my head is pretty engaged with what is going on, but my ears only get to do something when talking with coworkers. So I listen to a lot of music and podcasts. Usually back and forth between the two, rather than a mix. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for music. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for talking and chatter. My job goes back and forth between planning and execution constantly, so it's a great way to keep the boring execution phase of my job lively.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" /></p><p>My favorite podcast shuts down its doors today, and that is the Brodeo aka GFWRadio formerly CGWRadio. The Brodeo starred the editors of Games For Windows Magazine formerly Computer Gaming World, who were Jeff Green, Ryan Scott, Shawn Elliot and Sean Malloy with Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.</p><p>CGWRadio began on February 16th, 2006. The first couple episodes were a little odd, but they eventually figured it out. On August 8th, 2006, they announced that CGW would become GFW and in November launched their first issue.</p><p>GFWRadio combined a unique brand of gaming humor with the trials and annoyances of working in the gaming journalism business and the joy of being in the business.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>After listening to GFWRadio, I never thought I'd have such an insight into the gaming media. This type of perspective is something that I never even thought about 4 years ago being a gamer. 4 years ago, I was still writing about games, but I never had the insight as to what the game's designers were thinking about, what the publishers were doing to promote the game, and what really went into making the game to begin with. I know so much more now-a-days about the pressures these publishing companies put on game reviews and journalists on exactly what they say about a game.</p><p>They also talked a lot about the themes in games and what the game really meant to them and wouldn't pull any punches. They'd give you their complete honesty opinion on what the game did right and what the game did wrong. They'd also completely deconstruct some games talking about character interaction, plot devices and themes.</p><p>Discussions on GFWRadio were a good balance between these industry related topics, and high-brow video game analysis, but weren't afraid to go completely low-brow too and talk about stupid things they do or have done. It's really just a bunch of guys bullshitting about their jobs, lives and games they play.</p><p>That's really where the term <b>Brodeo</b> came from. Jeff Green was browsing around Urban Dictionary and found this definition: <em>A get-together or a party where the attendance is predominantly male.</em> He brought it up on the podcast and the cult following of GFWRadio labeled it as such.</p><p>The real humor of the show came from "Hero's of the Web", Dramatic Readings, Stories of griefing and gaming, and other coined terms, segments and jokes that became running gags.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>April 8th, 2008 marked the beginning of the end as Ziff Davis put a hard start to Games For Windows Magazine. Actually, I suppose, Ziff Davis declaring bankruptcy was really the beginning of the end. But shifting from a print magazine to the online space wasn't really something the GFW editors had been prepared for.</p><p>I wish I would've evangelized this podcast more when it was in its prime, but oh well. Popularity is not the reason it's ending. It's ending because the key voices of the show have now gone on to do bigger and better things.</p><p>In June, Sean Malloy announced that he had gotten a job for Blizzard and left 1up. Last week, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and he left to work on the Sims with Maxis and EA. And this week, Shawn Elliot finishes up the Brodeo and heads off to 2K Boston to work with Ken Levine (creator of Bioshock) on his next project.</p><p>Ryan Scott, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos are still at 1up and have said that they'll continue to podcast in some form or do something, but the actual Brodeo, has ended.</p><p>Times change. Jobs change. People grow up. You complete college, you gotta move on. You get your first job or your break in the Industry. You usually start at the same place many other begin as well. Eventually, you gotta move up in the Industry. So that's basically it.</p><p>A lot of voices have moved on from 1up, but there's plenty of new voices as well. With the Brodeo gone, I think I'll turn my attention to 1up FM, 1up's new podcast.</p><p>My hope is for a GFW Reunion at PAX 2009. ^_^ It was neat meeting Shawn Elliot at PAX, but I really didn't get to say too much to him.</p><div class='title'><b>Errata</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, You guys should definitely check out all the previous episodes of CGW/GFWRadio, which are hosted at <a href="https://archive.org/details/GFWRadioCollection" title="https://archive.org/details/GFWRadioCollection">archive.org</a>. I'm not really sure which would be the best to begin at. Probably around May 2006, if you plan to go the full distance.</p><p>Also, last week's podcast, Jeff Green's final podcast can be found in its entirety on video.
