Ultimately, its low marketing budget and audience's saturation of mindless sci-fi action led to its poor box office returns, labeling it a bomb. But, this film is very underrated and under-appreciated, and it's a shame.</p><p>The overall story focuses on a single decisive battle between humanity against an invaded alien horde conquering most of Europe. Loss of this battle will result in the loss of the planet and life on Earth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tom Cruise is the star of the film, which both helps and hurts the film. One year prior, Tom Cruise starred in Oblivion, which wasn't that great. I think the reception of that film hurt this one quite a bit because people didn't want to see another stinker. At the time, I think Tom Cruise was seen as very humorless and self-serious because of viral clips online. But, his ideas created a lot of the humor and light-hearted situations in this film.</p><div class='title'><b>William Cage</b></div><p>Tom Cruise portrays William Cage, the head of an advertising firm forced to join humanity's army because of his ROTC training in college. He is a coward and does marketing in the guise of journalism for the army to sway humanity's trust into their war efforts. To avoid battle, at the beginning of the film, he tries to blackmail the leading general of the frontline to avoid going to combat. He's arrested and thrown into the army with the new recruits.</p><p>While training with the new recruits, he doesn't know how to operate his weapons, he tries to run away from battle, and tries to convince others to get him out. In the battle, he squadmates are killed by alien enemies, known as Mimics, while he avoids getting hurt. As a final act, before the enemy kills him, he grabs a claymore mine and sacrifices himself as he blows away the enemy towering over him. Dead.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage awakes the previous morning, alive. The sergeant alive. His squad alive. He relives the same day again as it happened before. Once again, he's thrown into battle. Knowing the outcome of events, he attempts to save his squad members and others who had died. Ultimately, everyone still dies and he is killed. Cage awakes again the previous morning, and relives the day again.</p><div class='title'><b>Rita Vrataski</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h42m08s652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h42m08s652.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h42m08s652_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h42m08s652_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h42m08s652_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Rita Vrataski is the army's most decorated soldier, played by <b>Emily Blunt</b>. In the previous major battle, at Verdun, Sergeant Vrataski killed thousands of Mimcs, saved hundreds of soldiers, and led them to humanity's first victory against the Mimics. Her victory was the first time humanity had hope at actually defeating the enemy, so she became an symbol for the war effort.</p><p>Cage first meets Rita in battle on his first day, but she is immediately killed by incoming fire. So, on Cage's second day, he tries to save her, but he is killed. As Cage dies and relives the same day, he comes closer and closer to saving Rita to get her help to win the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h55m33s860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h55m33s860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h55m33s860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h55m33s860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h55m33s860_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>English Expression Class</b></div><p>So far, this is about 30 minutes into the film and it covers the first chunk of my <a href="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow">English Expression Class</a>. The goal of this class is for students to become more familiar with listening to and speaking native English with correct feelings and expressions. The majority of the class focuses on listening. Students will get a script with various words missing from the dialogue. While listening and watching the scene, they'll fill in the blanks with what's missing. We'll also go through the meaning so students can keep up with the story.</p><p>These listening activities lead to Performance Tests. Rather than doing a final Listening Test for the unit, students will make pairs and perform a scene from the film. Students will not only memorize and say the correct dialogue, but must act the scene with correct expression and feelings with their voice, face, eyes, and body.</p><p>The first performance test is when Cage meets Rita on the battlefield after days of trying to save her. From his actions, she realizes and understands Cage's situation. She throws down her weapon, and exclaims, "Find me when you wake up." Cage confused by the response replies, "What?" Rita, one more time clearly orders, "Come find me when you wake up," and they're both killed by an explosion.</p><p>Because the dialogue is so short, students exchange roles. My grading mainly focuses on the student performing as Rita. Cage's response is important to support Rita's dialogue, but ultimately it's Rita's dialogue that is key to this scene. Students must make a distinction between how the dialogue is said first compared to the second time when it is so clear, without any misunderstanding.</p><p>Again, check the <a href="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow">course page</a> for the full performance criteria, as well as worksheets.</p><div class='title'><b>Defeating the Mimics</b></div><p>Following orders, Cage ditches his squad during training to find Rita during her training. He tells her about what's happening, and she understands. She tells him that she used to have the power to reset time, and she used to win the battle at Verdun. She lost the battle when she was wounded and a medic transfused her blood.</p><p>Both of them go to meet Dr. Carter, played by Noah Taylor, a scientist who had previous helped Rita during the Battle of Verdun and understands how the Mimics operate. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Mimics operate as a single entity. The normal orange enemies are the Drones. They operate as an unthinking appendage of the horde. Killing them has no real effect. The larger blue enemies are the Alphas. These act as the enemy's eyes, ears, and nerves. When killed, an alpha sends a signal to the brain, which is called the Omega. When the Omega receives this signal, it restarts the day and corrects its course to victory.</p><p>On the first day, Cage killed an Alpha, but Cage was covered in the Alpha's blood. By absorbing the Alpha's blood, he also absorbed the Omega's power of resetting the day. When Cage dies, the Omega resets the day, and everything starts again.</p><p>To win the war, the Omega must be killed. Cage and Rita train together to make Cage mentally strong enough to kill the Mimics. Each day, Carter searches for the location of the Omega. As Carter gets closer to finding the Omega, Cage and Rita work on a strategy for plowing through the battlefield and reaching the location of the Omega.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Second Performance</b></div><p>After days and days of dying and little progress each day, Cage and Rita make it to a farmhouse miles inland from the battle. They find a helicopter which can bring them to the Omega.</p><p>Through their conversation and Cage's actions, Rita realizes that Cage has been leading her away from the helicopter in an attempt to save her life. Cage confesses that no matter how much they train and plan, she will always die here. There's no scenario where both of them can leave in the helicopter without one of them dying in an attack that follows.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h28m44s941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h28m44s941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h28m44s941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h28m44s941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h28m44s941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unlike Cage, Rita is not someone who quits. She exclaims that she's a soldier. Soldiers die for their country and their army. It's their sacrifice that propels others forward to ultimately defeat their enemy. Her death and the deaths of others are a necessary sacrifice for the victory of humanity. In the wake of that ultimate goal, her life doesn't matter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h29m33s663.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h29m33s663.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h29m33s663_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h29m33s663_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h29m33s663_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage pleads with her to stay at the farmhouse. Go into the bunker in the basement, and stay safe. It's impossible for him to save her otherwise. "Why does it matter what happens to me?" she asks.

Because the dialogue is longer, students will perform as either Cage or Rita in the pair and focus of their performance only.

The Alpha catches Cage and stabs him as he releases his grenades into the core. The core is destroyed, disrupting all signals to Alphas and Drones who become inert and lifeless. The war is over.</p><p>Cage's dying body sinks to the smoldering core, and absorbs its blood.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage awakes, days before the final battle, in the helicopter leading him to the army command from the beginning of the film. With the enemy destroyed and inert, the war is over and the battle is no longer necessary. All of his squad members are alive having never entered battle. Rita, too. The film ends with Cage meeting Rita at the base.</p><div class='title'><b>Morals</b></div><p>There are several morals to be learned from the film that I like to imbue on students. The first moral or lesson is the importance of repetition and continuous efforts towards your goal. Winning the entire war seemed absolutely impossible at the beginning of the film, but it was through Cage's reluctant yet continuous efforts that he gained the confidence and knowledge needed to win.</p><p>Additionally, he was not successful on his first attempt or even his fiftieth attempt. Cage constantly experienced failure and learned from his failures every day to progress further and further to eventually achieve victory. These efforts ultimately rewarded him with the ability to know what to do in an unknown situation when he no longer had the ability to reset the day at the end.</p><p>Also, through all of his daily failures, he showed his bravery. In the beginning, he was a coward who would do anything to run away from battle and danger. But, even on his first day, he showed bravery by killing himself to destroy the Alpha. That small showing of bravery gave him this power, and each day he showed more bravery trying to save his squad mates, and save Rita, too.</p><p>One of the key quotes in the film is <b>"Battle is the Great Redeemer."</b> Battle shows a person who they truly are as they shed whatever person they were in society. Cage was ultimately victorious because, at heart, he was courageous and brave. When pushed to the ultimate limit, what kind of person are you, really?</p><p>All morals are important for life, and the film shows this through Cage's journey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Original Script Ending</b></div><p>The finished film we received has a pretty happy ending overall, and doesn't necessarily play by its rules at the end. The whole film Cage always goes back to the base. But now, just to wrap everything up in a nice bow, he goes back to before he dishonored himself with the general, escaping punishment. His overall sacrifice ended up rewarding him with a happy ending.</p><p>The original script was not so kind. Leading to the final battle, it seemed like the Omega knew they were coming. One of Cage's squad mates even yells this out, "They know we're coming, man!" This is because, in the original script, in this battle previously, they had killed an Alpha. Killing an Alpha resets the day, but anyone outside of the Omega living that day wouldn't know it. </p><p>The Omega knows they are coming, and kills them all off one by one. The Mimics take over the Earth, and humanity is lost.</p><p>Tom Cruise and the production crew did not like this ending for several reasons. Thematically, it didn't really fit with the direction of the story towards the end. It didn't make sense for Cage to learn everything and grow, just to be killed in the end. Also, it wouldn't balance the overall feelings of the film. There are some comedic moments, but everything is so tense. There needs to be some relief. And, we've seen everyone die over and over again throughout the film that seeing more death wouldn't really have the weight to it.</p><p>I think they made the right choice.</p><div class='title'><b>Novel Differences and Ending</b></div><p>Edge of Tomorrow is adapted from a Japanese "light" novel entitled, <b>All You Need Is Kill</b>, by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It has since been adapted to a manga, too. There are some key differences in the story that lead to a different ending than both movie versions. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The biggest overall difference in the story which leads to many other story differences is that there's a fourth Mimic type. In addition to Drones, Alphas, and the Omega, there are also <b>Antennas</b>. For every Alpha, there is an Antenna, and the Antennas receive the signals sent from the Alpha to trigger the Omega to restart the day. For Rita and Cage to destroy the Omega, they must first destroy all of the Antennas, and then the Omega.</p><p>In the end, Cage and Rita (actually his name isn't Cage in this, but it doesn't matter) eventually destroy every Antenna and land the final blow on the Omega. But, the day resets. Even killing all the Antenna didn't work. This was because an Antenna still existed.</p><p>Much like Edge of Tomorrow, Rita had previously gained the time power from fighting in Verdun. But, when she lost the power, she didn't lose it completely. She became an Antenna and Cage is her Alpha. All Antenna must be killed. So, after killing all other Antenna, Cage and Rita face each other, and Cage delivers the final blow. He then destroys the Omega, ending the war.</p><p>Out of the three endings, I like this one the best. Rita can finally make her sacrifice that she decided on earlier. She's able to join everyone who died with her at Verdun, and the rest of the world is able to survive the Mimic invasion.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>Even with these three endings, people online have come up with lots of other ideas for endings. Also, recently (2024), there have been talks with Tom Cruise and Warner Bros to make a possibly sequel. With such a happy ending, there is still room to have more time shenanigans. So, how will they continue the story? What could they do?</p><p>Concluding class, I ask students to come up with a premise for the sequel.</p><p>One of the more creative endings from fans was Cage still retaining the time power from the Omega. After living his life with Rita, Cage finally dies of old age. But then, he wakes up back at the beginning of the final battle only to live his life again. The film could revolve around Cage becoming a bit of a demigod with the time power warping him. Ultimately, Cage has to figure out how to truly die.</p><p>Overall, <b>Edge of Tomorrow</b> is an incredible film. It's one of my strongest classes that revolve around a film. There's so much good in the film. This post is pretty long, and I never even talked about <b>Bill Paxton's</b> incredible performance as Master Sergeant Ferill. </p><p>I already spoiled the whole movie, but if you've made it this far without seeing it, you've gotta see it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the most beloved and revered spinoffs of Pokemon is Pokemon Snap for Nintendo 64. The idea of roaming around in a land while wild Pokemon "naturally" interact with each other and the environment has always given reality to people's imagination of how the real world of Pokemon could be.</p><p>For years, people have always said that they should make a modern update to Pokemon Snap and they finally did. Release on April 30th, <b>New</b> Pokemon Snap is the modern update every one had been asking for.</p><p>Back on the Nintendo 64, only 151 Pokemon were available, but 20 years later, there are now over 900 Pokemon. This game doesn't have all 900, but it has an incredibly balanced variety of Pokemon from all the different generations. It's pretty amazing how much New Pokemon Snap doesn't focus on just one generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>New Pokemon Snap plays almost identically to the original. You character hops into a pod and is pulled through the world on a mostly linear track. Your job is to take photos of Pokemon that appear in the environment. </p><p>Through the game, you unlock some ways to interact with the Pokemon. In New Pokemon Snap, you can throw out food for them to eat, throw orbs to light up pokemon, and play music. These interactions can change the course of your pod, or unlock other things.</p><p>Expanded from the original is the possibility of different tiered photographs. Depending on the interactions you before with Pokemon, they could perform a unique pose or even a special pose.  Every Pokemon now has 4 level of photographs to be taken. Tier 1 is a stand photo and Tier 2 is typically the Pokemon eating food. Tier 3 and Tier 4 are reserved for unique poses</p><p>With 200 total Pokemon in the game and each Pokemon having 2 unique poses, that's 400 unique photographs you need to take. It is a bit overwhelming, especially towards the end of the game when you're missing many of these photos. When you only get 1 or 2 new photos in a single run, it gets VERY repetitive and VERY boring quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>High Score</b></div><p>All photos in the game give you a score. If you get a "perfect" photo, it'll be worth 4000 or more points. All of these points add up to the total score of your Photodex. Pokemon Snap came out right at the beginning of Golden Week, so I had an entire week off from work to devote to this game. I was playing this game almost every day for HOURS after its release, so I was flying through the game.</p><p>Additionally, you can connect online and compare your Photodex score to everyone in the world. At my peak, I was able to become nearly 800th place in the world.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I could not keep up this pace forever. Vacation had finished, and I had to get back to work. Everyone else in the world who played video game for a living continue on without me.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnout</b></div><p>As mentioned above, once you do the broad strokes of everything in the game, all that is left is grinding. Finding all of the remaining photos, one by one. Slowly increasing the scores of your photos, one by one. Doing the same tracks, again and again and again. </p><p>There's not really much skill involved with the game. You wait 5 minutes to get the perfect photo, and if you miss it by a fraction of a second, you gotta do it again.  You try to get Pokemon to do what you want, but it occasionally goes wrong, and gets frustrating.</p><p>Eh, there's really no reason to push myself too hard in this game just to build my hatred for it. It's a good game and I like it, otherwise.</p><p>So, I put the game down. Here are my final stats in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it's a fun game with a lot of stuff to do. The Pokemon interactions are fun and interesting. Plenty of Easter eggs and hidden interactions to find that are really satisfying when you naturally find them.  Definitely worthy of the Pokemon Snap name. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock Bot" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer from Amazon, and after a lot of tweaks, I have my stream running pretty well through OBS and broadcasting to Twitch. I've had a small following, too, so I've made a Discord to chat with people while I'm not streaming.</p><p>You can find me on Twitch here: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock">https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock</a><br/>You can join my Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK">https://discord.gg/...</a></p><p>These days I've been playing a lot of Let's Go Eevee on stream. In each stream, I hunt for Shiny pokemon and eventually I plan on collecting all of them. In order to make my streams more engaging, I have created a Chat Bot that has various games and activities. This is <b>Schock Bot</b>.</p><p>Schlock Bot is a locally run program. When it is active, it'll connect to Twitch and Discord. It will read every message in the Twitch chat and every message in the Bot channel on Discord. If a command appears, it will respond. It is written in Java with connections to MySQL. Recently, I retro-fitted Tapestry into it, so it will also host webpages, which I use as Twitch overlays.</p><p>On Git-hub, you can view all the current functionality and how to use it. For Twitch Chat, its main function is taking bets on which Shiny Pokemon will appear next in Let's Go. Also, there's a guessing game, which will give the Chat hints on a Pokemon. The first one to guess will get points!</p><p>You can view the entire project here: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot">https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot</a></p><p>It's been really fun getting back into programming. It is really satisfying that while building this thing everything really came together. And then being able to use it immediately on stream and have real people interact with it. It's great. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Plans</b></div><p>Rock blocks are always what slows down progress and kills motivation, though. Nearly everything I've been able to think of, I've been able to put into this, but there are 2 major things I wish to add that have not been working.</p><p><b>One</b>, I want to be able to listen for Channel Points redemptions and other Twitch notifications. Apparently you do this through Web hooks, but I haven't been able to get it working. With this working, I could automate a few things in the background rather than doing it manually.</p><p><b>Two</b>, I have Schlock Bot hosting web pages, which are connected in Twitch and displayed. But, again, I'm manually turning on and off their visibility. I want to make a host of other webpages that show the most recent followers and display graphics or play sound effects. I'm having trouble getting these pages working. There would need to be some kind of Ajax thing that would listen for a prompt, and then react accordingly.</p><p>With both of these things working, viewers could redeem points and have graphics show up on my stream or have a sound effect play.  Ya know, just like all the other obnoxious streamers.  Some day, this'll happen.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Most Played Games in 2020" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/most-played-games-2020">Most Played Games in 2020</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 21, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Legend of Crystania is a film that has had a significant impact on me. Unlike any of movie, it wasn't because of the story, characters, art, or music. It was because, 14 years ago, my college friends and I and over 25 members of our college anime club, SPAMM, created a feature length fandub of the film. To this day, I have yet to know anything about the official story or characters other than it's connection to Lodoss War.</p><p>Our film was entitled The Secret of Crystania, and you can view it here: <br/><b><a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">theschlock.com/the-secret-of-crystania</a></b></p><p>Every since moving to Japan, I often go to Yahoo Auctions and when I'm there, I always search for Crystania. Over the last 10 years, many pieces of Crystania memorabilia has surfaced. Usually the prices are very cheap compared to well known anime productions of the time, so buying these things has worked on quite well. Recently, some very interesting things has shown up there, too.</p><p>I have scanned in all of my memorabilia, and you can take a look at it all below.</p><div class='title'><b>Theatrical Run Items</b></div><p>The Legend of Crystania premiered in Japanese theaters during the Tsunogawa Anime Festival on July 29th, 1995. It was part of a double feature along with the Slayers movie. Obviously, Slayers was incredibly popular, so people were basically suckered into seeing Crystania, too.</p><p>I have found a ticket from that event, which has a March 27th, 1995 date on it for some reason. Were they selling tickets that far in advance? Looking around all tickets have that date on them. I don't know why.</p><p>Additionally, I found a flyer for the premiere event as well as a film pamphlet. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As films release in Japan, theaters will sell a pamphlet book of the film with shots from the film, story explanation, and occasionally production notes, interviews, and other behind the scenes stuff. This particular book also has several pages of ads for additional Crystania mechandise. Most of the time these books are sold, but maybe these were given away with the premiere.

But, it was a decaying format and LaserDisc was the new hotness. LaserDisc took an incredible hold in Japan and almost all the modern popular anime releases got a LaserDisc release through the late 90s. The LaserDisc version of Crystania was released on March 23rd, 1996, and by the end of the year, the 3-part 6-episode OAV sequel was released on LaserDisc, too.</p><p>The LaserDisc version of Legend of Crystania is the most high quality release to date. In America, we got a DVD version in 2000, but the DVD version released by ADV was a transfer of the LaserDisc. Additionally, the American DVD has subtitles and other English edits burned directly onto the video. This cuts out some of the original video.</p><p>I picked up two copies of the movie as they weren't too expensive.</p><p>The VHS tape shows up on Yahoo Auctions from time to time, but I think it's unnecessary to own since the LaserDisc is the definitive version.</p><div class='title'><b>Animation Cels</b></div><p>Around 7 years ago, as I was looking through Yahoo Auctions, I first searched for Crystania and saw that some was selling animation cels. I had always dreamed or had a fantasy of owning animation cels of Crystania, but owning such things seemed incredible cost prohibited in my mind, considering cels of popular shows go for hundreds of dollars.  </p><p>Luckily, Crystania is not popular, nor even really all that good. I purchased my first cels and posted about it here: <a href="/old/v7/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania" title="/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania">theschlock.com/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania</a>.</p><p>The years went on, and occasionally more and more cels would appear on Yahoo Auctions. Today, I own 15 cels from the film. I have scanned them all, and added them in the gallery below.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Production Collections</b></div><p>Recently, these two items appeared on Yahoo Auctions and I immediately put all of my money behind acquiring them.

For many people, battling (number 2) is their most favorite thing about pokemon. They build up their best pokemon, and battle online or battle their friends. Catching every Pokemon in the game (number 1) has always been my real goal.</p><p>In Pokemon games, the Pokedex (perhaps short for Pokemon Rolodex or Pokemon Index) is a complete list of all Pokemon available in the game. Whenever you caught a specie of Pokemon, it is registered in your Pokedex as being caught. When the Pokedex is complete, you have essentially caught every Pokemon in the game. Once complete, you will receive a diploma detailing your accomplishment. :)</p><p>To catch Pokemon, you usually just find them out in the wild. Over time with more and more Pokemon added to the mythos, it no longer became feasible to have every single Pokemon available in the wild. As such, the Pokédexes were split between Regional dexes and the National dex. The National Pokedex is a complete list of all Pokemon, and the Regional Pokedex is the list of all Pokemon available in that particular game.</p><p>If certain Pokemon weren't available in the game, then you would have to either migrate Pokemon from a previous game or trade from another game in the same generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Completing the National Pokedex for the first time</b></div><p>Back in <a href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete" title="/pokedex-nearly-complete">December 2014</a>, I wrote about how I was close to completing my life-long goal of collecting every single Pokemon. In Pokemon White, my National Dex was at 647 out of 649, and for Pokemon X/Y and ORAS, I was at 717 and 716 out of 720.</p><p>A few months later, I was able to catch the few remaining Pokemon I needed.</p><p>In Pokemon White, I bought a used copy of Pokemon Black 2. That save file already completed the game and has a Meloetta and Latios on there. I transferred them over, and was able to get my Diploma for completing the dex. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Pokemon White</b> and Generation 5 was complete.</p><p>I migrated both Pokemon forward to Pokemon X/Y, which were both missing in my games.

Most recently, Generation 8 has begun with the release of Pokemon Sword and Shield in Nov 2019.  As of today, there are 890 total Pokemon across all games. </p><p>Unfortunately, the National Pokedex is being phased out due to the unsustainable amount of Pokemon.  Previously, Pokemon Sun and Moon were the first games to no longer include the National Pokedex. And now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are the first to actually no even allow many Pokemon from previous generations. In both games, you could only complete the Regional dex.</p><p>Not including the National Pokedex in both games completely killed off my enjoyment of those games. I really just sped through them, beat 'em, and moved on. I did not linger nearly as long as I did with Pokemon X/Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (ORAS).</p><div class='title'><b>The Modern National Pokedex</b></div><p>Pokemon Sword and Shield were released missing A LOT of features available in previous generations. Besides the National Dex, the most notable missing feature was the GTS, Global Trade System, which allowed players to easily trade which Pokemon they wanted.</p><p>Last month, they feature were released in <b>Pokemon Home</b>. This is an online database where you can store all of your Pokemon. It can be accessed from your Nintendo Switch and from your Phone. On your Phone, you're able to access the GTS, where you can trade any Pokemon you have in your Home account. You can organize all of your Pokemon, too. There are also many collection and trade challenges that will give you achievements and stickers when you complete them.</p><p>But, within Pokemon Home, the National Pokedex had returned.</p><p>From previous generations on the Nintendo 3DS, you could migrate your Pokemon forward using Pokemon Bank, a similar service on the 3DS. And with currently released Pokemon games on the Switch, you could grab Pokemon from them.</p><p>On the Nintendo 3DS, I began moving Pokemon from Pokemon X and Omega Ruby into Pokemon Bank, and then into Pokemon Sun and Moon and also Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. I didn't take too long to collect the remaining Pokemon I was missing from both games to complete the <b>Alola Regional Dex</b> in both games.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>All of my Pokemon from all of my previous games were moved into Pokemon Bank, and then migrated to Pokemon Home.

Pokeballs had just been invented, and you join a clan whose purpose it is to discover and catalog ever Pokemon species in the region.</p><p>This game felt tailor-made for me. Finally there was a Pokemon game whose sole purpose was the complete the Pokedex. Also, the gameplay was incredibly fresh for the franchise. You no longer had to battle Pokemon to catch them. You could simply sneak up behind them and throw a ball. You could dodge attacks, and move around. When you did battle Pokemon, battles happened right where you were. There was no separate battle screen. Everything in the game was open. I played this game day in and day out after its release.

And much like Pokemon Legends, going into and out of battles was very fast. Catching Pokemon was very fast, too.  It started to become clear that completing the Pokedex would just be a matter of putting in the work rather than having to grind out tons of levels and evolutions.

| November 17, 2019 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My absolute favorite video game soundtrack of all time is from Chrono Cross. It was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and had the perfect blend of atmosphere, mystery, and comfort. It perfectly complemented the dreamy and whimsical world of Chrono Cross.</p><p>This year is the 20th Anniversary of Chrono Cross, and to celebrate Mitsuda has gotten his band together to give a live tour of the Chrono Cross soundtrack. It will be performed 5 times in 3 cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.  Tickets were not so cheap at 16800<span class='ja'>円</span> (equivalent to $168), but it would be an absolute dream to hear my favorite video game music performed by the actual creator of the music. Easy buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Morning of the Concert</b></div><p>Prior to the concert, I met up with someone from the Internet who was also attending. We had our tickets reserved, but had to go to the venue early to actually get our tickets. Additionally, I wanted to visit the venue early because the merchandise booth was going to be open, too.</p><p>We went to the venue around Noon and waited for it to open. Plenty of other people were there, too. At 1:30pm, doors open but only a few people were allowed entry at a time. We eventually made it in at 2pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>At the entrance, we gave our reservations to the clerk, and they gave us our tickets. Inside were only a few people, and it was a line for the merch booth that curved around the room. </p><p>My goal was to purchase the concert towel for the event. In Japan, almost every concert or tour has a towel associated with it. It's kind of like a band's tour T-shirt in America. Tell 'em where you've been by buying a towel. The towel was 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> and I bought some stickers, too, for 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>. The tickets included a pamphlet of the concert, so I didn't buy that. Minutes after I purchased the towel, they were sold out, so I was able to get one in the nick of time. :)</p><p>We went back to my car to dump off our stuff, got some lunch, and went right back to the venue for the evening concert.</p><div class='title'><b>The Concert</b></div><p>We probably got back to the venue at 3pm or 3:30pm, and waited in line again. When the doors opened at 4pm, they were letting people in by sequential order of their tickets. Each individual ticket number was checked and let in by the order of when their tickets were purchased. You'd think this would take forever, but it went pretty quickly.  We made it in around 4:30pm, and the show began around 5:15pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The venue was tiny. Capacity was probably 1000 people? (as long as they were all smashed together) WAYYY smaller than the Tokyo or Osaka venues. It was nice, though. Much more intimate.</p><p>The band members took the stage in darkness, tuned their instruments, and the opening sequence for the concert began to play on the screen behind them. The dreamy motions of the title of screen of Chrono Cross. It detailed the preamble of the story.  And then, the heavy reverberations of the guitar being plucked as <b>Scars of Time</b> began, which moved into the light Flute.</p><p>It was incredible. It completely opened up my mind to hearing this music for the first time around 20 years ago when that first trailer dropped on the Internet, and when I imported the game on Playstation.</p><p>Mitsuda quickly introduced himself and the band as they played the opening menu music to the game. As "New Game" was selected, they played the battle music, which is how the game starts.</p><p>Overall, they played through the entirety of the game on the screen, and played the entirety of the soundtrack to accompany it.  I wrote down a rough setlist of what they played:</p><p><u>Main Set</u><br/>	1.	Chrono Cross - Scars of Time<br/>	2.	The Dream that Time Dreams<br/>	3.	Garden of God (Title Screen)<br/>	4.	Between Life and Death (Battle Music)<br/>	5.	Arni Village - Home World<br/>	6.	Arni Village - Another World<br/>	7.	Fields of Time - Home World<br/>	8.	Lizard Dance<br/>	9.	Termina - Another World<br/>	10.	Forest of Illusion<br/>	11.	Viper Mansion<br/>	12.	Gale (Boss Music)<br/>	13.	Victory (A Gift of Spring)<br/>	14.	Guldove - Another World<br/>	15.	Fortress of Ancient Dragons<br/>	16.	A Narrow Space Between Dimensions<br/>	17.	Dead Sea / Tower of Destruction<br/>	18.	Prisoners of Fate<br/>	19.	Magical Dreamers<br/>	20.	Zelbess<br/>	21.	Fate - The God of Destiny<br/>	22. Burning Orphanage??<br/>	23.	The Girl who Stole the Stars<br/>	24.	Frozen Flame<br/>	25.	Dragon God?? (Explanation for Elements. Screwing up, then Game Over)<br/>	26.	A Light for Lost Hopes (Game Over music)<br/>	27.	Life - Distance Promise (Elemental Song)<br/>	28.	Radical Dreamers - Unstolen Jewel<br/>	29.	Fragment of a Dream</p><p><u>Encore</u><br/>	1.	Song to get Mitsuda back on Stage<br/>	2.	Band Members Introduction Song<br/>	3.	Voyage - Another World??<br/>	4.	Voyage - Home World??<br/>	5.	Marbule - Another World</p><p>It wasn't like they just "played" the soundtrack to Chrono Cross. All of these were live variations of the original score. They deviated and mostly improved upon what they had before, and were able to match the crowd's reactions as they played. Much of the concert felt very interactive and Mitsuda explained a lot of his feelings and ideas for each song through the concert.</p><p>As the concert finished, there were credits on the screen, too. I have never been to a concert before with a credits screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Stuff</b></div><p>Concluding the show, this was all the stuff I came away with. I grabbed some of the heart confetti that were shot in the air during the concert, my light stick, and the things that I purchased earlier. Also included is a book of artwork we received as part of our ticket purchase. We also got a flame pendant, too, but that's not pictured here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Again, it was absolutely incredible and a dream come true to see, hear, and feel the music that has shaped my music tastes in video games. It was super dorky to rock out to RPG battle music. It was moving hearing Scars of Time and the other intro song live. And it was fun getting the audience to work together with their colored glowsticks to get the elements in the right order to get the true ending of the game/concert.</p><p>Mitsuda created an amazing concert, and with all of the production that went into the lights and video on display, I understand where the $168 price tag came from.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>With the conclusion of 2 additional final dates in Tokyo, Mitsuda has released an official set list from the concert.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" /></a></p><p>They also made an Apple playlist as well, so you can hear the music from the soundtrack.</p><p><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44" title="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44">https://music.apple.com/.../chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44</a></p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 12th, 2020</I></b></div><p>In a tweet, Mitsuda mentions that the final Nakano performance was recorded, and he is in the process of mastering the audio.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>As part of our ticket purchase, we were to receive a concert booklet of the event. We received an art book, but it was pretty short and didn't include anything about the concert itself. We filled out a card in order to receive this booklet later.</p><p>I got mine in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Calling this thing a booklet doesn't do it justice. In fact, this thing is thicker than most pre-order bonus art books. There are tons of photos from each of the events, interviews, sheet music, and logo designs. Almost all the production that went into planning the concert is included in the book.</p><p>This was BY FAR the most production value I've ever seen packed into a single musical event. In the beginning, it seemed like the concert was a huge expense, but it's clear how much love and care went into the event. Mitsuda clearly loves his music for Chrono Cross as much as his fans, and he loved this experience as much as we did.</p><p>It's an incredible memorial of the event.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - June 24th, 2020</I></b></div><p>This is the concert that keeps on giving. Today, Mitsuda and Procyon Studios released their recording of the final concert in Nakano Plaza. For only 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> on <a href="https://mora.jp/package/43000033/A86298/?fmid=TOPNEWRL01" title="https://mora.jp/package/43000033/A86298/?fmid=TOPNEWRL01">Mora</a>, you could download the complete concert in FLAC format. </p><p>I have been listening to this nonstop on repeat at work while I check student's writing. It's absolutely incredible to be able to relive this concert again and again.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 25th, 2021</I></b></div><p>Everyone said it was going to happen, and today Procyon and Mitsuda announced a live Bluray release of the final concert performance at Nakano plaza. </p><p>I purchased the limited edition version of the Bluray which comes with a download for an arrangement album of Chrono tunes, and some extra stuff.  This cost a total of 14100<span class='ja'>円</span>, which is a lot for a Bluray, but this'll be the very last Mitsuda can ring out of me from the concert. 14100 for the bluray, 16800 for tickets, and 2800 for merch. This totals 33700<span class='ja'>円</span>, or about $337.</p><p>It was totally worth it, though.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - April 15th, 2021</I></b></div><p>The preorder for the Bluray concluded on March 1st, and 6 weeks later, I was finally able to catch my deliveryman and get my Bluray.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It includes a full Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience of the concert with absolutely crisp audio and a full video recording of the event, too.</p><p>Also included is a short pamphlet of photos from the event, and a download code for the arrangement album. This arrangement is okay. I don't think it's as mind-blowing as the actual concert, but it's still a great listen. Much more low-key, too.</p><p>…And now, finally the saga is concluded.

Carter, played by <b>Israel Broussard</b>, brought her here last night, and helps her out before she storms out of the building. Throughout the day, she continues to mean and rude to others, until she is ultimately murdered at night by someone in black with a Baby mask of the school's mascot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Teresa wakes up in the morning again, the same dorm room with Carter. She continues throughout the day as everything had happened before. By the end of the day, she changes her actions to avoid the situation that led to her death. But, she's murdered again in a different way by the same person.</p><p>Thus, the mystery and suspense continues in sometimes unexpected ways as Teresa stumbles into various death scenarios to ultimately find her killer.</p><div class='title'><b>High School Expression Class</b></div><p>Since 2019, I've been using this film in my 1st year Expression classes. This was actually the first film I decided to use, too. Despite being a horror film, it is PG-13. There's no blood or nudity, so it's a very school friendly film, besides the idea of suicide. Here are the full <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course contents</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jessica Rothe is also really great in the film. She puts in all of her efforts in each of her scenes to bring out feelings of tension and mystery. Her acting is very expressive which makes it easy for students to understand her thoughts and feelings without necessarily understanding what is said. Broussard does a pretty good job with this, too, and complements Rothe together as Tree and Carter.</p><p>Another reason that I really like the film is the overall journey Teresa takes from beginning to end. Throughout her adventure, she's able to examine her life and understand how terrible she's been to others. By the end, she's changed into a better person.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the class ends, I mention to students that people often go through life working on one thing to the next without truly examining their life. It's important to think about the kind of person you really want to be, and think about what you can do for yourself and others around you to accomplish your goals and their goals, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Class Contents</b></div><p>You can view the whole list of course contents on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. After watching portions of the film, I have questions for students to answer about the contents. Or, we'll watch a particular scene again and again for listening. For questions, we'll watch the film with English subtitles. For listening, there are no subtitles. Sections of listening are often followed by double-checking the meaning of the dialogue.</p><p>The main fun of the course are the performance tests. Two students will make a pair and perform dialogue together. The full grading criteria is on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. Grading for the performance test is based on the correctness of the spoken dialogue, the expressiveness, and also cooperation between both members because acting isn't something done alone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first performance scene is about 25 minutes in the film between Tree and Lori. Tree has already been killed twice, so she confesses to Lori about what's going on and how she feels. Lori doesn't believe her. In the scene, one student is Tree, and one student is Lori. While performing the dialogue, they should correctly show these emotions through their voice, body movements, and facial movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The second performance test is way more intense. After dying 5 or 6 times, Tree is sent to hospital. The killer is there, too, but Tree escapes in Gregory's car. She's then pulled over and arrested on an empty highway. She thought she had gotten away, but the killer catches up with her and confronts her in the back of the police car. Through frustration, fear, and confusion, she snaps at the killer. "What do you want? Why are you doing this? Who are you?"</p><p>This is the performance. One student stands over the other, and Teresa says these words with passion and emotion. Then, they switch roles. I think it's easy for students to understand her frustration and fear, but students should really try to push their voices to match the emotion. Not too loud, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final performance is the opposite. After realizing her terrible behavior and how she has treated her father, Teresa finally meets him at the restaurant and apologizes. She holds his hands, and whole heartedly says, "I'm sorry" and "I love you."</p><p>In a pair, one student is Teresa and the other is the father. They hold hands, and one student expresses these words to the other. This isn't so easy to do. Eye Contact is important. Also, students should try to think of their own parents to correctly express their feelings. Pairs with friends or same gender is usually best for this.</p><div class='title'><b>The Ending and Sequel</b></div><p>Maybe it's not too difficult to figure out the identity of killer. Halfway through the class, I have students write down their thoughts of killer and write out two reasons why they think so. Some of them already have the right idea.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211_t.webp" /></a></p><p><i>Spoilers</i>, it's her roommate, Lori. I think their motive makes sense, and the opportunities for her to commit the murders makes sense. Some people online aren't so convinced and complain about it, but the movie doesn't take itself so seriously that everything has to make total sense.</p><p>There is an alternate ending where Gregory's wife, Stephanie, is the killer. I think her motive makes more sense, but her opportunities do not. Perhaps Stephanie and Lori working together would be best.</p><p>Either way, I feel like Happy Death Day never really got its chance to shine. Nobody really talks about this movie enough.</p><p>There is a sequel, <b>Happy Death Day 2U</b>, but the hard turn from horror into science fiction and a further lean into comedy, which is often too slapstick, probably turned off its audience. A third movie to complete the trilogy is set up at the end, but it was never given the green light. 2U came out in 2019, so the pandemic also helped killed the three-qual.</p><p>Both movies together are pretty fun, and definitely recommended.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hida-Osaka Falls 飛騨小坂の滝" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hida-osaka-falls">Hida-Osaka Falls 飛騨小坂の滝</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
