| March 12, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I attended the 30th Annual International Seminar of Budo Culture, which coincided with the 150th anniversary of the start of the Meiji era in Japan.  This year’s main lecture was <b>The Features and Potential of Japanese Budo Culture</b> given by Seiichi Takeuchi <span class='ja'>竹内</span> <span class='ja'>整一</span>.  He is currently a professor at Kamakura Women’s University, and former professor of the University of Tokyo.  His field is the study of ethics and Japanese thought.</p><p>The lecture was given in Japanese and translated into English by Alex Bennett, who is currently a professor at Kansai University and has written and translated many books on the Japanese Budo arts.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my 3rd time attending the seminar.  Every year I’m able to get amazing insights into budo martial arts and learn about their connection to Japanese psychology and culture.  I previously wrote about the main lecture from the first seminar I attended two years ago: <a href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan" title="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">March 4th, 2016</a>.</p><p>Overall, I felt the contents of the lecture did not match the title, but the main idea expressed in the lecture was another fascinating look at an explanation for Japanese culture.  The theme carried through the explanations and examples was that of <i>onozukara</i> and <i>mizukara</i></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」</span></b></div><p>Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> explained the cooperative duality of these two forces behind the decisions and actions of people in Japanese culture and society.</p><p><i>Onozukara</i> <span class='ja'>おのずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自然の働く</span><br/><i>Mizukara</i> <span class='ja'>みずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自分の能力</span></p><p>Let’s do <i>mizukara</i>, first.  <i>Mizukara</i> is the effect from oneself.  It’s the idea that an action or decision you made came as a result of your own willpower.  <i>Onozukara</i> is the workings of nature, the idea that there is an overwhelming force behind a decision or action that made or allowed it happen.</p><p><i>Mizukara</i> is pretty easy to understand, but <i>Onozukara</i> is much more ambiguous.  In western countries, <i>onozukara</i> could be similar to the will of god.  God is an outside influence, and people often thank God for giving them fortunes, or blame God for misfortunes.  This was brought up in a question after the lecture had finished.</p><p>But for Japanese people, the idea of God is not a singular entity.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned if you asked a Japanese person who they pray to when they pray, they would not have an answer.  They wouldn’t know.  The will of nature is a result of many different factors and moving parts within the world and society.</p><p>As another example, another question was asked, "Did you decide to do this lecture? Or was it the will of nature?"  He replied that he did want to do lecture, but he was also asked by many people to do it.  The people he knew and the connections he’s made throughout his life knew his expertise that made him qualified to give a lecture on this subject.  In that way, there was a force that created the opportunity for him to accept.  So, this lecture was a result of the actions of both nature and self.</p><p>So, the idea of <i>onozukara</i> is the force of everything around us.  It’s the connections we’ve made with people in our lives, the opportunities society gives us, and nature itself.  It is not, directly, "the will of God."</p><div class='title'><b>Example within Japanese Language</b></div><p>These two concepts aren’t something that is thought of on the surface level.  People aren’t consciously thinking about the will of themselves or nature when making decisions.  But there are examples within the Japanese language that build on this idea.</p><p>The main example given was <b>I am to be married</b> <span class='ja'>結婚することになった</span>.  When people get married in Japan and they announce it to their family and friends, they use this phrase.  It’s very passive and reflects the idea of <i>onozukara</i>.  Getting married is simply a matter of course.  It’s natural.  Additionally, the effect of getting married wasn’t just decided or caused between the two involved.  It was the culmination of the people around them and their families’ blessings and good intentions.</p><p>He did mention later in the lecture that a lot of young people these days use a more affirmative phrase when speaking informally about marriage, <span class='ja'>結婚することにした</span>, <b>we’ve decided to get married</b>.  The two getting married take responsibility for their marriage as opposed to passively excepting it as a matter of nature.</p><p>There could be any number of reasons for why this is becoming more popular.  Perhaps young people aren’t being taught more tradition methods of speaking than they were before.  Maybe people aren’t getting married as often as before, so they don’t hear the phrase enough.  Or perhaps, as English and the western world becomes more prevalent in Japan, people are becoming more direct and affirmative when expressing themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Connections to Budo</b></div><p>As a practitioner of a budo martial arts, we also seek for our movements to become natural.  In the beginning, we chose to study a martial art of our own free will (<i>mizukara</i>).  We all have our reasons for wanting to do it, whether it be for health, for friends, for fun, or because it looks cool.  We start from ourselves.</p><p>There Japanese word <span class='ja'>習う</span> <i>narau</i> means "to learn", but literally, it means "to continually repeat things" and becoming accustomed to it.  As a result, over time, these actions become natural.  You no longer need to think to do them.</p><p>In Budo, we strive for this level of movement where the thought process is no longer a factor, and to become part of nature, the natural flow of life (<i>onozukara</i>).  When movements and actions are not performed naturally, they are not seen as being complete.</p><p>In Kyudo (archery), for example, when one reaches the level of complete mastery, the practitioner feels that the bow no longer exists.</p><div class='title'><b>The 3 points of Japanese Thought</b></div><p>Within the balance of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> is the concept of Japanese thought and 3 points that define it.</p><p><span class='ja'>自然</span> <i>shizen</i> - nature<br/><span class='ja'>意気</span> <i>iki</i> - will power<br/><span class='ja'>諦念</span> <i>teinen</i> - resignation</p><p>The idea of <b>nature</b> leads to accidental fury that was must put up with.  It’s something that we must endure and grow from.  <b>Will power</b> is the willingness to put your body on line for what may happen.  And if something goes wrong, it’s your responsibility to <b>resign</b> yourself to the outcome, and not make excuses for the result.</p><p>Though, resignation does not mean to simply give up.  It’s about reconciling the efforts of one’s will with the movement of nature, and to be able to see something clearly for what it is.  And in some cases, recognize your powerlessness to deal with whatever comes.  We take for granted our power over nature and often think that we can overcome it, but in reality we cannot.  Nature is a much greater force.</p><p><span class='ja'>申し訳ない</span> <i>moushi wakenai</i><br/>This phrase literally translates to "there were no reasons behind my actions" or "there is no verbal excuse for what I have done."  This is used as a strong apology in Japanese, but an actual apology means to explain your actions and why you were wrong.  This goes one step further by saying there can be no excuse for the action I’ve done.  In this way, you’ve accepted the outcome (resigned) and take full responsibility (will power).</p><p>On the other hand…</p><p><span class='ja'>すみません</span> <i>sumimasen</i><br/>This is used as a light apology and basically means <b>excuse me</b> or <b>sorry</b>, but the direct and complete translation is something closer to "my actions were not clear or clean or complete," or "I wasn’t able to completely do this action myself."</p><div class='title'><b>Other Japanese Words</b></div><p>Much like the lecture on the cardinal virtues of Japan, speaker Seiichi Takeuchi wrote several books on the subject of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.  He wrote 4 books, actually.  3 of which are out-of-print and expensive!  On Amazon, they are being sold for nearly 7000<span class='ja'>円</span>.  But, there was one book I could buy for only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」のあわいで</span> <span class='ja'>やまと言葉で</span> <span class='ja'>哲学する</span>.</b> or <i>onozukara to mizukara no awai de yamato-kotoba de tetsugaku-suru</i>.  <i>Awai</i> isn’t so easy to translate, but I was told, in this context, that it basically means between.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> talked about this balance between both <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> in his lecture, so I think it makes sense.  <i>Yamato-kotoba</i> basically means words (<i>kotoba</i>) that encompass the spirit of Japan (<i>yamato</i>).  And lastly, <i>tetsugaku</i> is philosophy.  So, the title is basically <b>The Philosophy of Japanese Words and Their Existence Between the Balance of <i>Onozukara</i> and <i>Mizukara</i></b>.</p><p>The book starts off with a quick summary and definition for <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>, and then has chapter on specific Japanese words, phrases, or expressions, their history, and their connection to <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For example, <span class='ja'>ありがたい</span> (thanks), <span class='ja'>めでたい</span> (congratulations), <span class='ja'>あう</span> (when meeting someone), <span class='ja'>あいする</span> (loving someone), and so forth.  Maybe in the future, I’ll try and go through some of these chapters and write something about them.  For many people, though, Japanese philosophy is an incredibly dense topic.</p><div class='title'><b>Relation to Myself</b></div><p>Anyways, </p><p class='img'><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Lecture Abstract</b></div><p>Japanese will often say things like <i>kekkon suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to be married) or <i>shuushoku suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to start work).  It should be expressed as "I decided to …"  Even if something is decided by the will of the individual (<i>mizukara</i>), it is expressed as something that has been predetermined for him or her as a matter of course (<i>onozukara</i>).  This in turn indicates a tendency to accept things in one’s life and the world as being naturally preordained and to be accepted passively.  The Japanese philosophers Kuki Shuuzou identified three elements in the features of Japanese thought: "nature" (<i>shizen</i>), "chic" (<i>iki</i>), and "resignation" (<i>teinen</i>).  This means that based on "natural" (<i>onozukara</i>) conduct, when something occurs the individual decides from one’s self (<i>mizukara</i>) to confront the situation putting their own body on the line (for example, seppuku) in the spirit of "chicness" (<i>iki</i>), while also resigning (<i>teinen</i>) the self to go with the natural flow (<i>onozukara</i>).  The culture of Japanese thought is considered within the encounter between the movement of nature (<i>onozukara</i>) and exertion of the self (<i>mizukara</i>).</p><p>Japanese budo culture is the same.  According to Kuki, "The ideas of Japanese morality maintain a significant meaning in universal nature (of <i>onozukara</i>)…  Morality which must reach the stage of becoming 'natural' cannot be seen as complete."  The term "morality" (<i>doutoku</i>) can be replaced by the word "budo" here.  In bud, first engaging in rigorous training or study from your own volition (<i>mizukara</i>), if it does not ultimately become an inevitably natural (<i>onozukara</i>) activity then it "cannot be seen as complete."  To "<i>narau</i>" (learn) means "to continually repeat things" thereby gradually becoming accustomed (<i>nare</i>) to it, and "reaching the stage where it is natural."  In the culture of Japanese bud, there are correlations with moral, religious, and artistic thought in that one’s own efforts (<i>mizukara</i>) will finally proliferate into and connect with natural expansiveness and depth (<i>onozukara</i>).  Seen in this way, the features and potential become apparent.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Funayama 船山 in Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/funayama-in-winter">Funayama 船山 in Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Norikura looked gorgeous.  The sky was quite clear.  And the sun was just below the true horizon about the rise.  I decided to grab my coat, put on my shoes, get in my car, and drive south to Funayama to catch one of the most fantastic views in Takayama.</p><p>I went to Funayama about a year and a half ago (<a href="/old/v7/funayama" title="/funayama">November 5th, 2016</a>) and it was incredibly easy.  Because of the cell reception station and towers at the top of the mountain, there’s a paved road that goes all the way up.  And because of those buildings, I assumed the entire way would be plowed for easy access.</p><p>Well, I was half right.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5285.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5285.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5285_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5285_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5285_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5290.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5290.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5290_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5290_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180303_funayama/IMG_5290_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The road leading to the top was plowed up to the cabins.  The sign near the fork of the road said it was another 2 km before reaching the top.  I thought, "that’s not that far.  I can run that in about 15 minutes."

| February 11, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Blade Runner 2049 was a very overwhelming film when I saw it the first time.  A lot of that came from the sound, music, and visuals.</p><p>The sound and music are very loud and unnerving.  It helps describe the enormity of the future and density of the city.  Much of the music drips of wet industry.  Loud sprawling flanges in wide shots.  Silence and subtle tones in movement.  The technology of the future feels organic and grown out of past that incorporated the technology into itself, rather than began anew.</p><p>The art design compliments the music well.  The future iterates on the future shown 30 years ago in the original Blade Runner.  Displays are blocky monitors rather than flashy holograms.  Communication is done through these displays, rather than a smartphone-like device that keeps constant communication between people.  The future also feels organic and lived-in.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner</b></div><p>The premise of Blade Runner is that a corporation has developed technology to essentially manufacture people.  Replicants are not mechanical robots or cyborgs or something like that.  They are a completely organic manufactured person.  Designed to be less emotional and strong, they are mainly used off-world as a physical workforce or soldiers or whatever dirty-work humans don’t want to do.</p><p>In the first film, replicants are Nexus-6 models made by the Tyrell Corporation and are illegal to bring to earth.  Blade Runners are a section of the police force to capture or take out rogue replicants that somehow get to earth.  The main plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard, a blade runner, as he tracks down 4 rogue Nexus-6 models that have come to Los Angeles.  One significant aspect of the Nexus-6 model is their 4 year lifespan, which was used as a security deterrent if they were ever lost or escaped.  </p><p>The secondary plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard’s relationship with Rachael, who is a prototype Nexus-7 model.  She was given memories and believes herself to be human.  The memories define her as a person, and as such cannot be easily detected as a replicant.  They’ve removed the lifespan limit as well.  The film also famously toys with the idea of whether or not Deckard himself is a Nexus-7 model, too.</p><p>As a result of the events of Blade Runner, the Nexus-6 models were deemed too unstable or uncontrollable for continued use, and Nexus-7 models never went to manufacturing and their designs lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner 2049</b></div><p>Nexus-8 models were quickly developed by the Tyrell Corporation and sent to market.  Models had registration numbers imprinted on their eyes, and records of all models were kept in a central database.  Replicants were easy to tell apart from humans.  But the public rejected them because of how violent and problematic the Nexus-6 models were.  Many models were hunted down and killed in the streets on Earth.  This led to the events described in the short film, Blackout 2022.  Two replicants successfully destroy the database and detonate an EMP above Los Angeles to erase all records of Nexus-8 models.</p><p>From that point on, replicants became strictly illegal.  All surviving Nexus-6 models died naturally.  Nexus-8 models went into hiding.  The Tyrell Corporation went out of business.</p><p>Over the next decade, the infrastructure of Earth begins to deteriorate with the loss of the replicant workforce.  There are not enough people to sustain the ecosystem.  Niander Wallace of the Wallace Corporation buys the Tyrell Corporation and begins developing the Nexus-9 model of replicants.  These models are have the same feature of the Nexus-8 models, but designed to be absolutely loyal.</p><p>In the short film, Nexus Dawn 2036, Niander Wallace brings his new Nexus-9 model before congress, states his claim that humanity needs replicants and that the replicant-ban be revoked, and then demonstrates their obedience.  Congress moves to revoke the ban, allowing Wallace to mass-produce Nexus-9 replicants and help rebuild the Earth’s environment.</p><p>In Blade Runner 2049, the main character is a Nexus-9 replicant, KD6-3.7, or "K" for short, played by Ryan Gosling.  He works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner tracking down remaining Nexus-8 models.</p><div class='title'><b>Cells Interlinked</b></div><p>To verify K’s operational stability, he is subject to a baseline recalibration test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" /></p><p>The test asks him a series of questions followed by a word of phrase he is meant to repeat.  The replicant is not meant to think or respond to the question, only the subsequent phrase.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the film is how K’s obedience gradually and subtly erodes over time.  Much like the test, within his police work, he is meant to avoid or deflect questions while getting answers.  Within his investigation and daily life, every question is a test.  In the beginning, he doesn’t waver.  Sapper asks him questions.  He ignored them.  Luv asks him questions.  He deflects.</p><p>Besides answering to his boss, played by Robin Wright, it’s only when Mackenzie Davis asks him a question, "What’s this?"  "A tree," that he responds directly to someone else’s question.  The first failure of the baseline test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" /></p><p>Later, he speaks with Robin Wright about the case and she asks him a direct question of the case, "What do these numbers mean?" or "Do these numbers mean anything to you?"  He replies, "No."  A lie.</p><p>As K continues to investigate the whereabouts of a replicant born into this world, rather than manufactured, and as he starts to believe that he is that child, he starts to question his obedience and loyalty.  In following scenes, his stern emotionless face begins to crack under the weight of his feelings.  Through his blank face, we can feel his sadness, frustration, and confusion.</p><p>Blade Runner 2049 follows K’s transformation from a mindless "robot" into someone fighting for himself and others and what he believes is the right course of action.</p><div class='title'><b>Imagery</b></div><p>Because the movie centers on K and his lack of emotion, so many scenes feel sterile and emotionally distant even though they are gorgeous.</p><p>I went through the film and picked out many images that shows the beauty of Blade Runner 2049’s art direction in set design, costume design, and visuals.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Denis Villeneuve</b></div><p>So, Blade Runner 2049 was definitely my favorite film of 2017.

Both movies were continuations and adaptations of previous works, but had a voice of their own, presented with a tense atmospheric soundtrack and beautiful visuals that engaged me completely.  I haven’t really seen any of his other films, but I’m definitely going to pay attention to whatever he does next.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to January Total Lunar Eclipse" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/january-total-lunar-eclipse">January Total Lunar Eclipse</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

During the day, the moon moved in front of the sun and cast parts of America in darkness for a short time.  Total lunar eclipses are not so rare and seem to happen fairly regularly.  The website <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/">https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/</a> has a list of all their occurrences past and present.</p><p>Living in Japan, I’ve already seen one total lunar eclipse in <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">October 2014</a>.  It was a beautiful and clear night, so the red, blood moon cast in the Earth’s shadow was in clear clear view.</p><p>This January, there was another total eclipse, which began around 8:30pm.  The weather was cloudy, but it was light with many breaks.  The moon was clearly visible in the sky.  </p><p>It was also cold cold cold.  It was definitely below zero.  Maybe -4?  I thought about driving to somewhere beautiful and open to view the eclipse, but it was just too cold for me to sit outside.  The moon was clearly visible from my apartment, so I simply set up my tripod in my kitchen, opened the window, and shot the moon from there.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the lack of indoor heating in Japan, the cold temperature indoors really made no difference.  My apartment usually feels like it’s colder inside than outside anyway.  It only lacks the wind.  Besides, sitting under a pile of blankets (as I usually do at home) would be warmer than sitting around outside.</p><p>Here was the schedule for the eclipse:</p><p>Penumbral begins - 7:50pm<br/>Partial begins - 8:50pm<br/>Full begins - 9:50pm<br/>Maximum - 10:30pm<br/>Full ends - 11:10pm<br/>Partial ends - 12:10pm<br/>Penumbral ends - 1:10pm</p><p>The penumbral is a partial shading or dimming of the moon as the Earth begins to eclipse the sun.  The partial is when the full shadow begins to engulf the moon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the moon well into the penumbral and minutes before the partial began to creep.

It’s an absolutely beautiful game set in the far future after current society had already collapsed.  Roaming the lands are robotic animals that human civilizations hunt and harvest for parts to build and protect their villages.</p><p>From the moment it was first shown at E3 in 2015, everyone wanted to know more about it.  The concept looked interesting and unique.  Unfortunately, it’s release in early 2017 was completely blown away by The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.  On the surface, both games were an open world that lent itself towards exploration.  But Zelda had many aspects that innovated and expanded the genre compared to Horizon’s iterative approach.</p><p>But, unlike Zelda’s pure sense of exploration, Horizon’s strong sense of story fueled my exploration of the game’s world.  How did the world turn out like this?  Why are their robotic animals running around?  What is going on?  Underneath the lush beauty of nature are several metallic facilities of a futuristic society long dead.  Why?  And by the end, there are satisfactory answers to these questions.</p><p>Combat feels great.  Every beast you encounter has a weakness to exploit, or some specialized parts to harvest.  After a while, you are given enough equipment to take on these enemies in a variety of ways.  You can set traps, or blow off body parts.  Fire down arrows from safety, stealthily melee enemies from bushes, or just run in and attack directly.  It’s fun, and certainly challenging on higher difficulties.</p><p>Throughout my play through of the game, I stopped several times to use the photo mode and take a picture of the environment around me.  So many shots and scenes in this game is incredibly gorgeous, and the photo mode made everything come out great.  Every game should have a photo mode at this point.  Below are all the shots that I kept.  They include areas and scenes from the DLC, as well.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Final Fantasy XV" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 4, 2017 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Despite it’s many flaws, I like Final Fantasy XV quite a bit.  The story was quite clumsy.  It’s representation of women was poor.  And some sequences in the game required some patching and reworking from the developers.  But, I loved the music, setting, and, most of all, the main cast of characters.</p><p>From the beginning of the game, all the way through until the end, you play as Noctis and have your three friends, Gladiolus, Prompto, and Ignis, by your side at all times.  At the beginning, as a player, I didn’t really care for them.  In previous Final Fantasy games, the other cast members are just kinda there.  They have their one or two story moments, and for the rest of the game, they don’t talk or add anything to the experience.</p><p>In Final Fantasy XV, your three friends, the other party members, constantly talk about pretty much everything that’s going on.  Noctis doesn’t really say a whole lot unless it’s a pivotal story point.  I think most people get annoyed about this.  But after a while, it’s just the norm.  And their character shows through all of the interactions they have.  The friendship between the four characters isn’t really explained.  It’s felt.  It’s atmospheric.</p><p>For the first half of the game, none of this really has an impact.  You basically take your party members, your friends, for granted.  Then, at a certain point in the game, things change that impact your friendship.  They become quiet and sometimes scornful.  I was able to feel the magnitude of the decisions and consequences of the previous events through the change in atmosphere.  I had come to care for these characters, and now that things had changed.  It felt tense and sad.</p><p>And it wasn’t just getting passed what had happened or about trying to get things back to the way they were.  It was about living with the decisions that were made, and moving forward.  And moving forward together as a group, rather than breaking apart forever.</p><p>Being able to feel this connection to the characters and being able to relate to this kind of conflict through my own life was really powerful.  The localizers did an excellent job conveying this dynamic between the characters.</p><div class='title'><b>Photos</b></div><p>Anyways, one of the other great things about the game is the photographer of the group, Prompto.  Throughout play, he passively takes photos at somewhat random points.  When you take a rest at the end of the day, you can go through these photos and keep the ones you like.  Sometimes these photos even capture some glitches or bugs.</p><p>The following are all the ones I’ve kept.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kendo San-dan 三段" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kendo-sandan">Kendo San-dan 三段</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| November 24, 2017 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><span class='ja'>剣道三段に合格しました</span>！</p><p>Right on track.  After passing the ni-dan test two years ago, I’ve been able to continue practicing and learning more about the Japanese martial art of kendo.  And last weekend, I was able to pass the 3rd level of dan, san-dan, in kendo.  </p><p>According to the sensei giving the test, I am the first foreigner to pass this test in Gifu.  Breakin’ boundaries!  Though, that title obviously comes with some caveats.  There are plenty of other foreigners living in Japan that have passed this test, and are way higher rank than me.  They just don’t live in Gifu.  If Gifu had a higher foreign population, someone would’ve passed this test long ago.  It’s more a sign of foreign folk living in more remote areas of Japan.</p><p>I was certainly nervous going into the test.  I understood everything that was required of me, but I wasn’t sure if I could do everything perfectly and correctly.  I don’t think I would’ve been able to pass if it wasn’t for my new job working at Takayama Nishi High School, and practicing kendo with the students, especially the 3rd year students, nearly every day for the last two months.  It was really rewarding taking the same test with those students, and all of us passing.</p><p>Passing the test with my 3rd year high school students is also very apt because I feel like san-dan level is analogous to high school level proficiency and knowledge in kendo.  Passing san-dan is like graduating high school in kendo.  And, in a few months, the 3rd year students will actually graduate high school.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Levels</b></div><p>I previously remarked that passing ni-dan just felt like a stepping stone.  San-dan was the true next test.  But, after talking with some people about it, I don’t think that’s exactly true.  In fact, I think the high school analogy works pretty well.  The 1st grade kyu, or ikkyu, is equivalent to elementary school proficiency.  1st grade dan is like the beginning of junior high school, and 2nd grade dan is completing junior high school.  3rd grade dan is completing high school.  After completing high school, you’re an adult in kendo.  Fully proficient in kendo.</p><p>The next level is 4th grade dan, which could be thought of as completing college.  You are now a full professional in kendo.  Kendo is no longer just something you did, it is something you do.  You have proven that you are kendo.  With the next grade, 5th dan, it’s like completing a masters or a phd program.  You are not only a professional kendo practitioner, but also a specialist in kendo.  Typically, 4th and 5th grade dan are the lowest levels where one leads their own dojo or has a sensei status within their own dojo.</p><p>Beyond that are 6th, 7th, and 8th dan.  These levels are only awarded on a national level.  A practitioner is now nationally recognized as a master in kendo.  Even though kendo is a life of continued study of the art, most lessons are learned through teaching others, and contributing to the martial art as a whole.  You are now a master that others look up to.  </p><p>Anyway, I think this is a pretty good comparison.</p><p>Having passed the test of adulthood in kendo (3rd grade), the next step is becoming a professional in the martial art (4th grade).  Apparently, people consider this the next big step.  Probably because of the age requirements.  4th grade dan is the first level only adults can take.  </p><p>In Gifu, 4th and 5th grade dan tests are only done twice a year and with everyone in the prefecture.  Up through 3rd dan, the proctors travel around to different regions several times throughout the year.  It’s a much bigger deal with much fewer practitioners taking the test.</p><p>But, for me, that’s in 3 years.  It’s not enough to simply "cram" for the test starting 2 months in advance.  I need to continue practicing throughout these next 3 years and retain the ideals of my current grade so I’m able to reach beyond it.  Thankfully, I work at the perfect school and live in a great town to make this happen.</p><p><i>Update: March 1st</i></p><p>Today, all of the 3rd year students graduated from high school.  We also received everyone’s certificate for completion of 3rd grade dan back in November, so they were able to get them before they left officially left school.  It’s very fitting (though also convenient) to get them today as I consider passing san-dan as the equivalent of completing high school.</p><p>I got my certificate, too. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having now mastered the basics of doing kendo for myself, 4th grade dan and up is the study of being able to instructor others on the best ways to do kendo and guide them on the right path while sharpening your own skills.  And as high school students graduate, they continue to university and college and do exactly that with either kendo or their own profession.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rom Hack Custom Box Art" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rom-hack-boxart">Rom Hack Custom Box Art</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Since the Super Nintendo Mini displays everything in a visual way, every game needs a box art. So, I've made custom graphics for these games.</p><p>You can view them below along with a description, but you can download them all in a ZIP file here:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhrGHONO8y72HUyo5R0uX7QTTyRjRPOS" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhrGHONO8y72HUyo5R0uX7QTTyRjRPOS">https://drive.google.com/.../1dhrGHONO8y72HUyo5R0uX7QTTyRjRPOS</a></p><div class='title'><b>Super Nintendo Mini</b></div><p>In summer, Nintendo announced the follow up to their massively successful NES Mini console, the Super Nintendo Mini.

There were some funs games, but the Super Nintendo was always king. The NES Mini had been hacked after its release so you could add your own games to it. It only took a week for people to get this working on the SNES Mini. It used the exact same security protocols and data structure, so it's was easy for them to figure out.</p><p>The funnest thing about the Nintendo Minis was the interface. Most retro devices just gave you a simple text list of games to choose from. Very sterile. The Minis have a rotating list of box arts which is a very visual ways of seeing all the games you have available.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was no longer just a device to be able to play games. It was a way of visualizing your game collection. Putting your own favorite games on the system was an excellent way of building your own personal collection of the best games on the best console every made.</p><p>As mentioned above, you can do more than just add more games. Over the years, people have made many rom hacks of games adding in exploits or change characters. More modern rom hacks have gone further making almost an entire new game from existing assets.</p><p>Many rom hacks don't have their own box arts, and using the original game's box art didn't make much sense in a lot of cases. Thus, I had to create my own.</p><p><b>Note</b>: It should be stated that while I arranged each of the graphics, I did not create any of the artwork used in the images. Most of this artwork I found on the Internet, and was used in some way to promote the game. I wanted to create a homogeneous set of images that would fit in with original box art, but was still modern reflections of what the rom hacks did with the games. </p><p>If you are reading this and happened to create any of the artwork used, let me know, and I'll credit you.

The forests that cover the roaming mountains strengthen, and show their brilliant deep green.  They fade into the horizon and turn from green to blue to match the sky.  Carved out of the valleys are small pockets of civilization where we live, surrounded by this awesome, beautiful nature.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>A strong part of the traditions of our area are onsen.  Onsen are facilities and hotels centered around a hot spring bath. A hot bath is the perfect cool down after exercise.  Intense physicality met with passive recovery.  The therapeutic effects of an onsen come from the temperature of the water, and its chemical make-up.  Though, I think the main reason people come to the onsen of Hida is the beautiful serene nature that surrounds you as you bath and relax.</p><p>You can receive the temperature benefits from any public bath in Japan.  Water temperature tends to be around 40ºC.  The hot water expands the muscles in your body and improves blood circulation.  The body works hard to cool itself, which increases your metabolism.  An onsen might also have a cold bath around 20º or below.  Lying in this pool is massively chilling and forces your muscles to tighten and contract.</p><p>The idea of contrast therapy is to hop back into a 40º bath, and alternate back and forth.  This soothes and heals muscle soreness, facilitates recovery, and conditions the body and skin against temperature change.  It feels fantastic, but be careful.  The rapid changes can cause dizziness and even fainting.</p><p>The Hida area has more than 250 onsen.  Many onsen in Hida have additional therapeutic effects from the unique chemicals in the water.  Many of these places are outside of cities, set in forests near some beautiful hiking trails.  These are some of my favorites.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Far east in Takayama is Hirayu no Mori <span class='ja'>ひらゆの森</span>.  This is a sulfur (<i>you</i>) <span class='ja'>硫黄</span> containing sodium bicarbonate saline hot spring (<i>tansan suiso shio izumi</i>) <span class='ja'>炭酸水素塩泉</span>.  It contains other minerals, too, such as calcium <span class='ja'>カルシウム</span>, sodium <span class='ja'>ナトリウム</span>, magnesium <span class='ja'>マグネシウム</span>, and chloride (<i>enka butsu</i>) <span class='ja'>塩化物</span>.  Sulfur, bicarbonate, and chloride hot springs are all known for their healing effect on cuts and bruises.  Sulfur springs also helps lower high blood pressure.  Bicarbonate springs are known to wash fat from the skin leaving it young and beautiful looking.  Chloride springs connect with proteins on the skin to strengthen it.</p><p>The indoor baths are gorgeous, and have the feeling of a Japanese castle.  Outside baths are carved out of the rock, and allow you to lavish in the surrounding nature.  It’s the most beautiful onsen I’ve been to yet.  And entrance is only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>!

And through learning the language, her thought process changes, her perception of time begins to change, and she’s able to view parts of her future. Because she’s able to understand and process their language, she’s able to think like them and perceive time like them.</p><p>This is the central plot of the movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Human Examples</b></div><p>Let’s go back to our previous sentence, and compare it with some other languages.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.<br/>Je marche à l'école tous les jours.<br/>Yo camino a la escuela todos los dias.<br/>Ich gehe taglich zur Schule.</code></p><p>There’s English, French, Spanish, and German.  Each has its own sound and ring, but the basic sentence structure is the same.  I walk.  Je marche.  Yo camino.  Ich gehe.</p><p>The very first thing we care about in the sentence is "who" followed immediately by "what is he/she/it doing."  After that, everything else is details.</p><p>I think this is because our culture, personalities, and attitudes tend to be very direct.  Or we tend to favor people and ideas that are very direct.  If we can quickly and succinctly communicate the who/what and it’s action, we can understand the idea faster and fuller.</p><p>So, how does this compare with Japanese.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は毎日学校に歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>First is the subject (<span class='ja'>私</span> <i>watashi</i> or I), but the verb is the very last thing in the sentence (<span class='ja'>行きます</span> <i>ikimasu</i> go).  All of the other details are explained before the actual actions.  I think this is because Japanese language and culture tends to be indirect a lot of the time.</p><p>The Japanese teacher in class went on to give some examples of indirectness in Japanese, such as refusing an invitation.  In English, when refusing an invitation, we typically say something like, "Sorry, I can’t" or "I’m busy," and then maybe followed by a reason.  The refusal can be softer, but typically the first thing we say is very direct, "I can’t."</p><p>In Japanese, such directness could be considered rude or harsh, so the polite way to refuse is to be more indirect.  "Sorry.  On that day, I’ll be out of town"  or "Sorry, I already have another engagement on that day."  There’s no real reason to say "I can’t" because it’s implied, and because of that those harsh words are never said.</p><div class='title'><b>Switching Brains</b></div><p>As long as I’ve been learning Japanese, people have always mentioned the idea that they’re able to "switch their brain" when fully immersed in Japanese.  They claim they think in Japanese and speaking Japanese becomes more natural to them.  Sometimes they need to stop for a second to switch from talking in one language to the other.  </p><p>This idea is the foundation behind the plot of <b>Arrival</b>.  Louise can change switch her brain when communicating in the alien language, and then be able to perceive her current and future memories at a single time.</p><p>This has never been the case for me.  Over these last 4 years of living here, and 15 years since first learning Japanese, I’ve really just maintained a single mode of thought.  My thought process always tends to translate and interpret the incoming Japanese into something I can understand.  Outgoing, too, has a quick translation from English to Japanese.</p><p>Though, this single mode of thought has changed and been molded over time by all the language and culture I’ve absorbed and learned by living here.  For certain kinds of grammar and vocabulary, I can say them pretty fast.  It just feels more instinctual rather than a complete switch.  Through practice, I feel like I’ve simply trained my brain rather than developed something completely separate.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/18">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/16">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
