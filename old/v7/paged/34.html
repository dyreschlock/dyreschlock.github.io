| August 31, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The night before I moved into my new apartment, Fishy, Chaos and I took a stroll down State St, and had dinner at The Osaka House to celebrate my night of homelessness.  There was a point where I had been to every sushi restaurant in Madison, but in the last 4 years several new places have emerged. The Osaka House poised itself on being new, but after our visit it is merely a satellite restaurant of Edo Restaurant.  Edo is located in Monona, and is where my coworkers and I go for sushi because it's the closest.  Osaka House had the same new menus that Edo has.  They even said 'Edo Restaurant' on the cover.  But anyway, this is all good because Edo Restaurant is quite delicious.</p><p>I ordered a bunch of rolls that sounded delicious, and I noticed a super cheap roll under the vegetarian options:  Asparagus Sushi, $3.  Hell, how could I pass that up.  Out of the whole night, I would say this roll was the stand out for me.  Though, not because it  was better tasting than anything else I had, but because I had no expectations for it.  I mean, $3 and purely vegetarian?  How good could it be?</p><p>But it was surprisingly good, and incredibly simple.  Just a single Asparagus stalk in rice.  Fuck, I could do that.  I've tried making sushi before, with disappointing results, but how could I mess this one up?</p><p>Now that I'm settled into my new place, I took a look at a few recipes online, and found the following recipe for preparing Asparagus (&lt;a href="http://embitca.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Cook-Asparagus"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and sticky rice (&lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/how-to-make-perfect-sushi-rice/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Make the two separate, and then combine.</p><p>Tonight, I invited two of my friends over, Kate and Fishy, and attempted to make them dinner.  So, here's what I did, and here's what I learned:</p><div class='title'><b>Asparagus Sushi Recipe</b></div><p>Here are all the ingredients you'll need</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp"  /></p><p>Black Pepper, Salt (I used Garlic Salt), Rice Vinegar, Balsamic Vinegar, Sugar (I used Honey), Olive Oil, Asparagus, Dried Seaweed (aka Nori), and Rice.</p><div class='title'><b>1) Make Rice</b></div><p>The first thing I did was make 2 cups of rice, because, out of all the steps, that takes the longest.  I have a rice cooker specifically for this task, but you can make the rice however you want.  Just make sure to <b>wash and clean</b> your rice, or else all the dust and dirt will get baked in and you lose a lot of flavor.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>2) Prepare Asparagus</b></div><p>I laid out all my Asparagus on a flat baking pan.  I covered the pan with some Aluminum Foil to save me from some extra clean up down the road.  On top of the Asparagus, I drizzled some <b>Olive Oil</b>, doing my best to coat the veggies.  Next, I did the same with a little bit of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  Followed by some <b>Black Pepper</b>.  And concluding with some <b>Balsamic Vinegar</b>.  With all the seasoning scattered on top, I started tossing all the Asparagus together to mix all the ingredients and to properly coat everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>3) Roast Asparagus</b></div><p>Rather than steam or pan fry the Asparagus, I went with the Roasting route as that recipe suggests.  I preheated the over to 400, and dumped the whole pan inside.  After a while they start to simmer and smell really really good.  After 10 minutes, I took a single piece and tried it.  Not quite finished.  We decided to leave them in there another 5 or 7 minutes. We probably should have left it in there a little longer than that, but it turned out alright.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>4) Sticky Rice Mixture</b></div><p>While the Asparagus were baking, I made the mixture for the sticky rice.  In the little pot, I combined the 1/4 cup of <b>Rice Vinegar</b>, 1/4 cup of <b>Honey</b>, and 2 tbsp of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  I didn't measure any of this, I just eye-balled it.  I turned on the stove to #4, which heated the mixture really fast.  The recipe says to mix everything until the powder has dissolved in the liquids, and then you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>5) Sticky Rice</b></div><p>With the mixture complete, simply add it to the rice, and mix mix mix.  While the White Rice is naturally very sticky, this mixture will start breaking it up a bit, and make the rice much more manageable, and delicious.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>6) Combine!</b></div><p>Putting Sushi together is the easy, and the most fun part of this whole recipe.  The more challenging parts (to me) are correctly preparing everything to put inside the sushi.  To make sushi, start with the <b>Nori</b>, lay down the <b>rice</b>, put the <b>ingredients</b> on the rice, roll them together, and that's it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp"  /></p><p>Though, you might find that quite difficult just using your hands to place everything together.  The rice will stick to anything dry, so the trick is to constantly wet your hands.  You can have a bowl of water to dip your hands in, or I just use water from the tap.</p><p>Wet your hands, grab some rice, stick in on the Nori, and continue until you have a line of rice.  Place the ingredients in the center most portion of the rice.  With your hands, roll the Nori and completely surround the rice.  Roll it all the way around so you have a tube.  Surround the tub with the bamboo roller, and tighten it up.  Hold it for a couple seconds so the heat can penetrate through all the layers of the Nori, and fuse it together.  Then release, and you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp"  /></p><p>With a super-sharp knife, you can segment the roll into individual pieces.  But my knife is somewhat dull right now, so we just chowed down on the rolls as is.</p><div class='title'><b>Lessons Learned, and solutions!</b></div><p>After eating that first roll, there were 2 problems...</p><p>The <b>first</b> problem was that you could hardly taste the asparagus.  If you notice that first image under combining, I only used 3 stalks in a roll.  The rice totally overpowered the sushi.  To solve this I used twice the amount of asparagus, and it turned out so much better.</p><p>The <b>second</b> problem was that I didn't clip the asparagus.  One step that I skipped from the Roasted Asparagus recipe was cutting off the fibrous wooden stem that cannot and should not be eaten.  The video made mention of the point between food and stem was the snapping point.  Hold on a stalk and break it with both hands.  Where it breaks is where you want it separated.</p><p>After solving these two problems, I thought they turned out delicious.  Though, I don't think my lady friends were impressed.  This isn't exactly gourmet food.  Plus, I don't have any furniture in my apartment, so we ate on my carpeted floor.  This was the <b>third</b> problem, I think.  Also, if I had dishes, then we could've made use of <b>soy sauce</b>.  Also, I was missing some <b>wasabi</b> and <b>ginger</b>.</p><p>But whatever.  This is some delicious food that was easy and quick to make.  Barring the 30-40 minutes it takes to make 2 cups of rice, everything else was about 20 minutes.  And most of the steps can be done concurrently, so once the rice is done, you can start rolling.  Though, you may want to wait 10 minutes for the rice to cool, or else you'll burn your fingers.</p><p>Also, going by this recipe, I yielded 7 rolls.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX Prime 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-prime-2011">PAX Prime 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The annual Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle is this weekend.  This has been creeping up on me.  After moving into a new apartment, the last few weeks have been busy and just flew by, and I almost forgot about this.</p><p>At the beginning of August, they released the panel schedule, and over the last few weeks, game studios have been issuing press releases on all the games they plan on having in the exhibition hall.  Everything seems to be coming together, and I'm definitely excited.</p><p>Here's some of the panels (and events) that I plan on attending...</p><p><b>1up Presents: Retronauts v. Your Fondest Memories</b> - Friday 3pm @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Although I don't listen to retronauts anymore, their live podcasts are always great.  Jeremy Parish and Chris Kohler have an incredible wealth of gaming knowledge, and they're joined by Jeff Green this year, which should add some extra humor to the mix.</p><p><b>Minecraft Adventure Update Q&A and Demo</b> - Friday 3pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch hosts a Q&A for the upcoming Minecraft 1.8 patch, and plays through a demo.</p><p><b>After Party w/ The Protomen</b> - Friday 8pm @ El Corazon<br/>An intimate after party with one of the best video game music groups!  Openers include Jonny Nero Action Hero, and Klopfenpop.  Hosted by Fangamer.</p><p><b>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'</b> - Saturday 10:30am @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Though I'm not really fan of Destructoid people, Ashley and Anthony Burch, along with their father, form a hilarious sibling rivalry over specific games.</p><p><b>Irrational Games</b> - Saturday 2pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>It's been over one year that Irrational Games unveiled their upcoming title BioShock Infinite, the pseudo sequel/prequel to their 2007 hit game BioShock.  The panel is lead by Ken Levine as he discusses the development process, what we're seen already of BioShock Infinite, and they'll probably play through the E3 demo on stage.</p><p><b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> - Saturday 3:30pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>One of the biggest and most hyped games of this upcoming season is the new Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim.  Bethesda devs take the stage, and most likely will run through the QuakeCon demo on stage.  Super excited for this one.</p><p><b>Square Enix Presents...</b> - Saturday 7pm @ Pegasus Theatre<br/>Squaresoft is heading a panel as well, and they will be unveiling a brand new title.  This title is Airtight Games upcoming FPS from creative director Kim Swift (creator of Portal, and director of the Left 4 Dead games).  While I don't give a shit about Square anymore, I'm quite a fan of Kim Swift.  Can't wait to see what it is.</p><p><b>Minecraft Griefer Party</b> - Sunday 5:30pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch is tearing down the Minecraft booth and giving away pieces of it as souvenirs.</p><p>Nothing else really caught my eye.  It seemed like there were a lot more interesting panels at PAX East this year (<a href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced">reference</a>).  It's also annoying that there isn't a Chiptune showcase.</p><p>But that's fine.  My time at PAX is almost always spent in the exhibition rooms standing in lines waiting for games.  This year there is a huge amount of upcoming games I'm interested in and all of them plan to be at PAX.  These include <b>House of the Dead</b>, <b>Team ICO Collection</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls Skyrim</b>, and <b>Zelda Skyward Sword</b>.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml">this list</a>, there will also be indie game <b>Fez</b>, upcoming Suda 51 / James Gunn game <b>Lollipop Chainsaw</b>, <b>Batman Arkham City</b>, <b>Mass Effect 3</b>, Grasshopper published titles <b>Sine Mora</b> and <b>Black Knight Sword</b>, and Sony will have <b>Playstation Vita</b> units to demo too.  Mojaang (Minecraft) has a booth too!</p><p>It should be an amazing fun time.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Added stuff about Minecraft from their <a href="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/">schedule</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hurrah!  Today is A Dance with Dragons day.  Almost 5 years ago, George R. R. Martin released the 4th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Feast for Crows, saying that originally it was too long!  A Feast for Crows was split into two books, and the next one should be out fairly soon.  5 years, all the fantasy nerds waited and waited and waited.  While it did take longer, the day is finally here.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5926.webp"  /></p><p>And Fuck me this book is huge.</p><p>As mentioned in my article a few days ago (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here!</a>), I finally started reading A Song of Ice and Fire as recommended to me by numerous friends,Â colleagues, and other random people.  And I've made the joke several times that each book in the series I read becomes the longest book I've ever read.  This is literally the case.</p><p>A Game of Thrones -- ~700 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Clash of Kings -- ~750 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Storm of Swords -- ~975 pages (hardcover)<br/>A Feast for Crows -- ~750 pages (hardcover)</p><p>I've only made it to A Storm of Swords at the moment.  I'm looking forward to A Feast of Crows which finally breaks the damn cycle.  But again...  Fuck me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110712_grrm/IMG_5928.webp"  /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons -- 1040 pages (hardcover)</p><p>While these books have been described as addictive page turners, I find myself incredibly exhausted.  SO exhausted.  All the novels and books I've read before have been around the 200 or 250 park mark, with one or two hitting 300.  The last time I had a reading binge, I think I read 7 or 8 books before my motivation began to die.  Given that I'm almost 200 pages into A Storm of Swords after finishing the first two books, I think I've hit my limit :(</p><p>These books just keep going on and on and on and on.  There are two main stylistic choices that George R. R. Martin has chosen for A Song of Ice and Fire, and he is utterly stuck with these choices.</p><div class='title'><b>Character Focused Chapters</b></div><p>At first, A Song of Ice and Fire is written in third person.  Each chapter is named after a character in the story, and each chapter focuses on specific events surrounding that character.  As the story progresses, the third person take becomes more of a first person perspective written in third person.</p><p>This is good for me, as I have difficultly establishing connections to characters when everything is written in third person.  A first person story gives me information about the character's thoughts behind the action, and allows me to understand why the character is doing what they're doing.  A Song of Ice and Fire goes to great lengths to make this possible, but in the third person writing style.</p><p>A Game of Thrones is a fantastic book where things happens in one character's perspective, and then the view changes to another character and you get the other side of the story.  You get all (most) sides of the story and begin to understand that there are no villians in the story.  Each character has their motivation, and are completely consistent in what they do.  It all makes sense.</p><p>This style works well when all the characters occupy the same space.  But, it falls apart in the second and third novels when all the chapter-characters are separated, and all have their own plots.  While A Clash of Kings does have an overall plot, several characters are not participating in that plot.  Main characters are now side characters.  ...but they're still treated as main characters since they have their own chapters.  Each chapter begs for my attention, but so much of what's going on doesn't really matter.  My interest is split up into 7 or 8 concurrent storylines going on at once.</p><p>This is why I'm getting exhausted by these books.</p><div class='title'><b>Flashbacks</b></div><p>Flashbacks are good, but they aren't so good when they're used to play catch-up.  Unfortunately, while I'm reading about one character's plot, shit is still going on in the world to the other characters.  So how do we make up for this?  Start off a character's chapter with a flashback explaining what they were doing while you were reading about the other characters.</p><p>That's really what I was going for with my previous post (<a href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color" title="/a-nook-of-color">click here, again!</a>).  It's hard to advance the story of a character when you have to make up for all time you missed covering the other characters.  The present timeline of the chapter seems to hang there.  The story usually catches up halfway through the chapter, THEN we can doing stuff in present time.</p><p>While it IS annoying, It's pretty seemless how he integrates most flashbacks into the character's chapters.  But overall, it really seems like a side-effect to doing character focused chapters to begin with.  I think the suggestion I've heard the most from people complaing about this is that he should've just made a book all about Bran.  Then a book about Arya.  Then so on and on and on.  But TOO LATE, you're stuck with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Reading... ugh</b></div><p>Looking at my numbers above, there are 4215 pages to Song of Ice and Fire (at the moment).  And I've read about 1650 of them.  Nearly 40%!  I'll try to continue reading, especially now that my friends and colleagues have started diving into the new book.  But I don't think I can handle more than 100 pages a week.  Maybe I should start skipping certain chapters, and just read the cliff notes online...</p><p>Happy Dance with Dragons day, everyone!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-the-mid">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ The Mid, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I wrote about my excitement leading up to the event a few weeks ago --&gt; <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden" title="/gabriel-dresden">here</a>.</p><p>I wrote that after a couple of their sets were recorded from the previous weekend and starting floating around the Internet.  The Beta Nightclub set from June 16th, and their Electric Daisy Carnival set from July 18th.  Both were very similar, and had a very unique sound that proved Gabriel &amp; Dresden had returned.</p><div class='title'><b>Style</b></div><p>While technically they fall under the Trance genre, they play a lot of tracks all over the place.  One of key parts of their sound is incorporating the current sound of dance music into their sets and into their tracks.  So they'll throw in some Skrillex and Wolfgang with the vocals to their tracks and others on top of them.</p><p>Given those recorded sets from June, I figured that we would hear something similar in Chicago, and that was absolutely the case.  Like I nerd, I stood there and recorded the whole thing, and have posted it to youtube.  Even recording kinda seemed like redundant as those two other sets are much much better quality than what my camera could do.  But, at least it gives us the opportunity to get a tracklist of the entire night and maybe capture a few deviations.</p><p>Here's the youtube link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99ED182ED80E7349</a></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>The tracklist was pretty easy to develop given the amount of overlap.  There are a few wholes in my list, though.  Only 8 IDs!  Not bad...</p><p>1. Justice &amp; DJ DLG vs Gabriel &amp; Dresden - Tracking Civilzation Down (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Mashup)<br/>2. Afrojack vs. Way Out West feat. Tricia Lee Kelshall - Replica Of Mindcircus (Dave Dresden Mashup)<br/>3. ID<br/>4.

Above &amp; Beyond feat. Zoe Johnston - No One On Earth (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix)</p><p>Leading into the weekend, Gabriel &amp; Dresden announced on Facebook that they were going to premiere a brand new song that they had just finished.  I think it's #22 on my list.</p><div class='title'><b>Duo</b></div><p>One thing that I found interesting about their performance was that they were both handling the controls during the entire night.  Both previous times I've seen G&amp;B in clubs, one of them would spin some discs, and halfway through the night, they'd switch.  Granted this was in 2004, back when they still had vinyl.</p><p>For Gabriel &amp; Dresden, I consider them to have 3 eras on distinct sound.  There's everything prior to 2004, 2004 to 2008 when they broke up, and their current sound in 2011 now that they've been reunited.  I wonder if they were spinning more as a concurrent duo towards the end in 2008, or if they were still separate as was the case in 2004.  Well, they definitely feel like a cohesive duo today. :)</p><div class='title'><b>The Mid</b></div><p>Overall, I had a great time.  Even though it was packed, it wasn't crotch-to-crotch packed, though some people seemed to think it was.  I still had room to move around, and rock out to the music.  Of course, I stayed in the exact same spot for 3 hours.  I didn't have to move through the crowds of people behind me.</p><p>The Mid has a very odd layout.  The dance floor is split up into two halves.  You have the front half in front of the stage that is completely clear and where all the dancing happens.  The back half, is completely roped off and filled with reserved tables for bottle service.  While, it seems perfect for those people who want to (or can) spend $500+ going to The Mid, and get a fantastic location in the club all to yourself, it's pretty horrible for us cheap (or budgeted) assholes who only pay for General Admission.  The reserved tables choke out the flow of human traffic from the back to the front.  The entire area surrounding that VIP is completely blocked off by bodies upon bodies of people trying to get somewhere else.  You have to shove your way through, basically.</p><p>But whatever, it's a nightclub.  If you want service or better treatment, shell out the cash.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to A Nook of Color" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/a-nook-of-color">A Nook of Color</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>"Excuse me, do you mind if I ask you which one that is?"</p><p>Everyday, busses enter Capitol Square in Madison, WI.  It's really the hub of all bus traffic in the city.  Whether they begin their journey there, or simply pass through is a matter of route.  Most busses arrive early, and must wait until their scheduled departure time.</p><p>Jim Hendricks waits at this bus stop every morning.  He walks from his apartment down the road, then waits for his bus to arrive.  This morning was really no different than any other.  The bus arrived on time and he boarded.</p><p>"It's a Nook Color", Jim replied.</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"A Nook Color," Jim replied again.  "From Barnes &amp; Noble."</p><p>"Ah yes...", the old man finally realized.</p><p>Today was a little different.  Someone on the bus actually talked to Jim.  Everyday, Jim waits for the bus, he boards, and now recently, he reads.</p><p>A few weeks ago premiered a television program that he was very excited for.  This program is called Game of Thrones.  It is based off of a series of novels that his college friends Tony of Gregerson and Erika of then Lamm, but now of Aho had implored him to read.  These friends were of like minds and tastes to Jim, and these books had captured their hearts.</p><p>"Game of Thrones is my favorite fantasy series.  All of his characters are rich, and his story doesn't care for them at all.  He kills of characters on a whim.  The story is brutal.  And you'd love it,"  Tony had stated.</p><p>"Yeah, Jim.  You should read them," Erika reinforced.</p><p>"I'm sure they're fantastic, but these books look really really long, and reading is boring," the young and naive Jim had replied to their recommendations.</p><p>It was 6 months and 5 years ago that Tony, in a further effort to expose Jim to these fantastic novels, had invited him to Madison.  The author, George R. R. Martin, had recently published A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in the series, and was on a book tour stretching from the salty seas of the Pacific to the Atlantic.  It was here that Jim met GRRM, shook his hand, purchased his books, and had them autographed.</p><p>But Jim was stubborn, and engulfed in course work at the time.  His stubbornness persisted even after university was completed, and began work in the midwestern city of Madison.  Many of his collegues had read the works, and shared their recommendations.  <em>Man, everyone loves these books.</em> But it was only until he saw the televised product that he began to head their words.  He and his friends watched in splendor as the distinct characters and vivid environments came to life.  After a few episodes, they were hooked.  They were fans.  And it was lucky that Jim owned the novels, so they all could read how it was originally wrote.</p><p>After 5 episodes had aired, Jim started reading Game of Thrones.  He had been discussing the program with Chris of Schroeder at his office.  <em>This show is pretty damn awesome, but there is a lot going on.  I really wonder how much of this stays true to the books.</em> So he read.  For the first time, in a long time, he read.  And of the recommendations, they were all justified.  For he did like the books.</p><p>"I really like it.  I bought it mostly for a vacation, and I've been using it quite a lot since then," he continued to reply to the old's man question on the bus.</p><p>Reading the novels had been great at first, but his yearly vacation across the seas to the volcanic Islands of Japan had drawn near.  He had a mere 200 pages remaining in Game of Thrones which he could surely finish given several hours.  <em>I'm just about done with this book, but I don't have to time before I leave.  I can't bring both books with.  They take up too much space.</em></p><p>He recalled a coversation he had with Lady Kait of Stites a week or two prior.  Though, he didn't recall the conversation perfectly as it had been at a bar, and Jim drinks many beers when he's at a bar.  He thinks this conversation was born out of talking about the band they at the bar to see.</p><p>"I find it odd how much I've completely switched to digital music.  I still feel like I'm one of those people who enjoys owning a physical copy of something.  But, ever since I bought this iPhone, I've stopped buying physical copies of music.  Almost everything is digital.  The only physical copies of music I purchase is Vinyl, as I feel that's the ultimate physical representation of music these days."</p><p>"Ya know, maybe books are the same way.  Having a first edition hardcover copy of book, is like having a vinyl copy of a vintage album.  And there are many books I don't care about but still want to read.  Maybe buying an ereader makes sense for those titles.  And portability too.  I'm going on vacation rather soon, and can't hulk around those mamoth tombs with me everywhere.  It makes sense to buy one of those things."</p><p>"Yeah, I could see that," Kait had replied, though probably just to humor him, as he was talking about boring things.  She smiled, and they went back to listening to the band.</p><p>A few days later, he found himself in Barnes &amp; Noble.  He was interested in the Nook Color above other ereaders for 3 key reasons.  The first was because of his hatred for e-ink.  e-ink was monotone and had an annoying lag between turning pages.  The second point had been it's OS built on Android.  There were several articles on tech blogs saying how easy it was to jailbreak the device, and find yourself with a full Android tablet.  Unlocked, it would be able to read any file format, read emails, looks at maps, translate Japanese.  The third point was the most important given the second point, the price.  It was only $250 for a easy-to-unlock tablet device designed as an ereader that could do much more.  After an hour of looking it over, and playing with it, he bought it.</p><p>He finished A Game of Thrones in transit to vacation.  Before returning from vacation, he was able to read over half of the second novel, The Clash of Kings.  Along with those novels, he packed several maps, an itinerary, a shopping list, and a Japanese dictionary on his Nook Color, and they were very helpful.  For this, he was grateful.</p><p>Back on the bus he relayed all of this information to the old man.  "So you can do a whole lot with it," the old man replied after a second of digesting what was just said.  Perhaps Jim had said too much information, and was probably boring people again.  They went back into silence.  Jim turned back to the Nook Color to continue reading.</p><p>He has started the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords and intends to read them all.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Child of Eden" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/child-of-eden">Child of Eden</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On a console that sees release after release of first person shooters in a war setting, or in a space setting, Child of Eden finds itself among a very different crowd.  It's about as opposite as you can get from all that.  It is a unique gaming experience that takes you on a journey of sights, sounds, and color.  Brilliant vibrant colors.</p><p>What Tetsuya Mizuguchi began with Rez in 2001/2002, he has continued with Child of Eden.  The visually stimulating and pulsing background bores its creatures.  On screen, you target these creatures and shapes with the crosshairs, lock on to them, and fire your weapons.  You also have smart bombs, that take care of all the enemies on the screen at once.  Child of Eden adds a third weapon: rapid fire.  Only rapid fire can take down incoming enemy fire, and some enemies are only vulnerable to rapid fire.</p><p>Both Rez and Child of Eden seem rather easy on the surface.  Point and Shoot, right?  It goes a little deeper than that.  In Rez, you start building up massive points if fire all your locked-on shots at once.  Child of Eden continues this scoring method, but adds in a little twist.  You need to fire your shots along with the beat in order to build up your multiplyer.  Rez did this automatically for you.  Once I figured this out, Child of Eden became a much more aesthetically pleasing game.  Music games always sound their best when you play them correctly.  :)</p><p>While this game is a beautiful work of art, I never really felt the same excitement and wonder I did when I first played Rez over 9 years ago.  Rez absolutey blew me away on that winter day in January 2002.  Each level had a unique feel.  It's music was raw, dynamic, and told a story of its own.  While Child of Eden's music has a few dynamic sequences, it feel mostly flat and generic.</p><p>Rez used tracks from established artists, and pulled together 6 songs that had variety and cohesion.  The music behind Child of Eden is a much different story, and barely mentioned anywhere.   It's really just an interactive visualization for the Genki Rockets.</p><div class='title'><b>Genki Rockets</b></div><p>The Genki Rockets is a group formed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi starring a fictional lead singer, Lumi, who is a hologram (much like Sharon Apple from Macross Plus).  It's known now that the lead singer is portrayed by Rachel Rhodes, but whatever.  Also in the group is music producer Kenji Tamai.  All other members are secret, apparently.</p><p>The group began in 2006 when Mizuguchi wrote the song "Heavenly Star", made a colorful video, and posted it to youtube.  It went viral, and became a huge success.</p><p>Like all other J-Pop groups who have fictional characters as band members, they have a detailed back story, and this is the same story that sets up Child of Eden.  Lumi is the first human born in space on September 11th, 2019 (NEVER FORGET).  She expresses her thoughts and feelings through songs, and sends them as messages to earth.</p><p>The Genki Rockets have a unique live performance involving the visual component as highly as the audio.  Since Lumi is in space, and has never been to earth, her appearance is projected on stage using hologram-like technology.  The wikipedia articles states the technology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner">Musion Eyeliner</a>, which is basically just using a large LED screen that gives the appearance of projecting.</p><p>They really don't have that many songs.  "Heavenly Star" premiered in 2006, and was featured in Lumines II.  In 2007, the recorded a couple more singles, and in 2008, they recorded enough to release an album.  They really haven't done a whole lot up until now.  Here's their tracklist for Child of Eden:</p><p>Stage 1 - Matrix - <b>Fly!</b> (2008)<br/>Stage 2 - Evolution - <b>Star Line</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 3 - Beauty - <b>Breeze</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 4 - Passion - <b>Maker</b> (2011)<br/>Stage 5 - Journey - <b>Heavenly Star</b> (2006) &amp; <b>Flow</b> (2011)</p><p>Check out their website: <a href="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/" title="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/">Genki Rockets dot Com</a>.  They have a live streamed concert on Ustream happening on Tuesday!</p><div class='title'><b>Extended Story</b></div><p>Child of Eden expands on Lumi's story.  With her music, mankind is inspired to explore the vast reaches of outer space.  With their exploration, the Internet expands and grows.  The Internet can be accessed anywhere humans have reached.  And the Internet is renamed to Eden.  Eden is the fountain that which all knowledge flows.</p><p>In the 23rd century, humans rebuild Lumi's likeness and personality in Eden.  Project Lumi nears completion, but is compremised by a virus attack.  And this is where you come in.  Protect Lumi, and complete the project.</p><p>Incidentally, the story of Rez picks up after Lumi is completed.  Later on, Lumi becomes the central AI for Eden and controls the flow of information.  However, the information is vast, and the task becomes overwhelming.  Lumi shuts down, and exposes Eden to all manor of virus attacks.  In Rez, you explore from your local areas of Eden to the central mainframes.  You take down rouge programs and viruses, while rebooting Lumi and restoring order.</p><p>It's rather interesting how Child of Eden portrays the future Internet as a lush utopia of wonder and beauty.  While the future beyond that in Rez is dark and crippled.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Child of Eden seems like the ultimate goal of Mizuguchi's plan for the Genki Rockets.  I really wonder at what point did that plan began.  Unfortunately I'm not as familiar as I should be with his works.  I consider myself a fan, but I haven't played anything of his since Rez.</p><p>After leaving Sega in 2003, he formed Q? Entertainment, and they've made Meteos, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and Gunpey.  Lumines is their huge money maker, and it makes heavy use of music.  Is all that music licensed?  or is it all original tracks developed in house?  I should play that game.</p><p>I wonder if the Genki Rockets was just some weekend project.  He got some of his pals together, jammed, and wrote a song.  Then he started working on the video, and then posted it to see what some of his fans thought.  With its huge viral success, he probably just wanted to see how far he could take it.</p><p>Then again, the Genki Rockets had all their fame in 2006 to 2008.  They sat on the back burner for 3 years until now with Child of Eden.  And you barely see the name "Genki Rockets" anywhere.  Mizuguchi is just retconning Rez to be canon with his washed up JPop band.</p><p>I'd be real interested to know the actual story behind all of this.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden">Gabriel &amp; Dresden</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My favorite trance duo of all time is Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden.  I've been of a fan of theirs since near the beginning, and some of their DJ sets I could listen to hours and hours over and over.  When they're on, they have the perfect mix of ambiance, harmony, and melody complete with an underlying beat that never tires me.</p><div class='title'><b>The Beginning</b></div><p>The duo formed around 2001 and 2002.  I think they really made it big when the played at the Pawn Shop at WMC 2002.  Later that year, Markus Schulz started featuring them on the Global DJ Broadcast every few months.  Leading into WMC 2003, they had their own Essential Mix, and during WMC 2003 their popularity exploded.</p><p>They first I had heard of them wasn't too long after that.  At the time, I was downloading DJ sets from the website djmixes2k.com.  Each week, they'd record the guest mixes from the Global DJ Broadcast, and host them on their site.  G&amp;D had a guest mix on July 6th, 2003, and it was one of the best mixes I had ever heard.  I was an instant fan.</p><p>I tried to find other stuff, and kept a look out for any new sets, but it wasn't as easy as it is today.  All of the music sharing communities were behind closed doors, and I really didn't have anything to offer in order to open them.  I just stuck to whatever showed up on djmixed2k.com.</p><p>They had two very solid tracks, As the Rush Comes and Beautiful Things.  Josh Gabriel is a technical wizard.  While other DJs were still running with Vinyl, and some using CDs, he was already embracing change beyond with Ableton.  Ableton is DJ software that can mix tracks on the fly. When Josh Gabriel took over the decks, all the track seamlessly melded together.  Tracks were mixed, remixed, and sampled to form a unique performance that was completely new at the time.  And backed by Dave Dresden amazing sense for track selection, their sets were always cohesive to the point it felt like a symphony.</p><div class='title'><b>Their Prime</b></div><p>2003 was an amazing year for Gabriel &amp; Dresden, and they continued to climb in 2004.  That's when I finally got the chance to see them.  They stopped by Vision, Chicago on Feb 28th, 2004. In fact, I had the opportunity to actually meet with them before the show through one of tranceaddict.com's meetups.  Their meetups had been very successful with Armin van Buuren, but when I arrived at the bar, there were only 5 of us.  Gabriel &amp; Dresden showed up, and we all had an awkward chat about random stuff.</p><p>Their performance was everything I had come to know them for. Harmonious and melodic trance that was way beyond what I was hearing from most other artists and DJs.  Hearing As the Rush Comes, Beautiful Things, and No one on Earth all live for the first time was a treat for me too.</p><p>Here are some pictures from that event: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago">http://theschlock.com/club/040228/index.html</a></p><p>Later on in September, they finally made it to Minneapolis.  Pictures: <a href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis" title="/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis">http://theschlock.com/club/040903_dresden/index.html</a></p><p>They continued to dominate throughout the year.  They released their first artist album and mix CD, and continued to pound out some amazing remixes, and performances.</p><p>Unfortunately, I started to loose track of them in 2005.  2005 was an awkward year as DJs made the inevitable transition from analog to digital.  Vinyl could not cut it any longer and it was either going to be CDs or Laptops going forward.  Also, during that time I was focusing on schoolwork and other hobbies which kept me at home in Platteville, rather than out in Chicago Saturday night.  I was still listening to their music downloaded from the Internet, but I wasn't actively seeking it out.</p><div class='title'><b>The Split</b></div><p>It wasn't until 2008 and 2009 that I returned to the dance music community, and actively starting following DJs again.  When I started looking up what Gabriel &amp; Dresden had been doing over the past years, they were no more.  In early 2008 they announced that they were breaking up, and at WMC 2008, they played their final performance at the Pawn Shop, the very spot that made them international acclaimed.</p><p>Their split makes sense though.  Even though they were a duo, they never played back to back.  It was always one than the other.  Dave wanted to play more housey "raise the roof" kinda tunes, while Josh wanted to actually build and blend a performance.</p><p>I went back through all the sets that I had missed, and none of them really had the same harmony as those original sets back in 2003.  There are some amazing gems in the bunch, though.  Their Banana Beach Bar set from Aug 14th, 2006 brings their later years very very close to their early years.  And their set from Guvernment, Toronto on Nov 16th, 2007 is an amazing mix of their later style.  I would say that it's the definitive Gabriel &amp; Dresden set of their later years.</p><p>Their final set from the Pawn Shop, WMC on Mar 28th, 2008 has been recorded, but it's not as tight or as expressive as the Guvernment set.  Maybe that's because all eyes were on them that day, and they went for technical greatness, rather than taking chances.</p><p>I don't really feel like I missed much having left them in 2005.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo</b></div><p>Unfortunately, I don't think they got the same acclaim running solo as they had hoped.  Dave Dresden and Josh Gabriel came through Chicago several times in 2009 and 2010.  And every time I saw they were coming, it didn't really register with me.  Even though when they were together on stage, their performances were separate.  I don't really know.  Together, they just had some kind of magic that blew everyone away.</p><div class='title'><b>Reunion</b></div><p>I think they figured this out as well, because in late 2010 they announced they would be taking the stage at the Hollywood Paladium together for New Years Eve.  Tickets sold out immediately, and the message boards went nuts.  It would have been amazing to be there in person.</p><p>They recorded part of their set and put it online, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-nye-2011" title="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-nye-2011">right here</a>.  I found it a little disappointing though.  The tracks didn't really compliment each other.  Most were just a bunch of other tracks that trance DJs were already playing.  It didn't have a unique sound at all, let alone did it sound like Gabriel &amp; Dresden.</p><p>"Well that sucks," I thought as I went back to listening to someone else.</p><p>But they were persistent.  A couple months later, they did another reunion show in DC, and again at Ultra Music Festival with Above &amp; Beyond.  I listened to their sets, and, again, it sounded no different than what other DJs were doing.  But the community was incredibly supportive.  G&amp;D signed on for a reunion tour, and now have basically announced that they have reunited for good.</p><p>I hadn't really been blown away by their reunion thus far, but when The Mid, Chicago announced G&amp;D were coming in July, I bought those tickets immediately.  I'm still a fan after all. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Reunited</b></div><p>This past weekend, they had 4 shows and 2 of them have showed up online.  Beta Nightclub on June 16th (<a href="http://www.tranceaddict.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=605277&forumid=6&s=" title="http://www.tranceaddict.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=605277&forumid=6&s=">info</a>) and Electric Daisy Carnival on June 18th (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-at-1" title="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-at-1">info</a>).  Both of these sets are very similar, and both sound pretty damn great.  After 6 months of being reunited, I think they've finally found their unique sound that sets them apart from everyone else.</p><p>Their melody, harmony, and catchy beats have returned, which makes me very very happy.  I can't wait to see them in July.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/35">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/33">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
