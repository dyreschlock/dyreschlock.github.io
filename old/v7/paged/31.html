| February 16, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past weekend I finished my second playthrough of Mass Effect 2 in anticipation of the upcoming release of Mass Effect 3.  After picking it up after leaving it for a year and half, I'm amazed at how engaging and rich the entire experience still is.  It's a fantastic game, and definitely my favorite new game to come out of this gaming generation.</p><p>My character has remained consistent throughout the events of Mass Effect 1 and 2.  My Shepard, Jane Shepard, has been a Paragon in most cases, and able to talk herself out of any problem.  She's also been incredibly thorough, completing all side missions, and collecting nearly everything spanned across the galaxy.  Well prepared and powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Wish Fulfillment</b></div><p>Around the release of Mass Effect 2, Anthony Burch (of Destructoid fame, at the time) released two videos talking about decisions and possible decisions you can make in the game depending on how consistent and thorough you play it.  The videos are from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml">January 27th, 2010</a>, and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml">February 3rd, 2010</a>.</p><p>I'm not that big a fan of that obnoxious website, but both these rants brought up the idea of Wish Fulfillment in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.  If you want something bad enough, you can have it!  You can have your cake and eat it, too.  If you want this character to live, you can play the game to the point where they will live.  Want all characters to live?  You can do that too!</p><p>There was one point where you had to make a decisions between two team mates, and one or the other was going to die.  It's the only scene between the two games where you can't have your cake and eat it, too.  It wasn't really a tough decision for me, though, because I didn't really like either character.  And so far, the consequence has been nothing but a palette swap.</p><p>But in Mass Effect 2, you can get on everyone's good side, and have everyone be happy with each other, despite the natural conflicts between some of the characters.  As Anthony mentions in the second video, when characters are fighting and it makes you choose, it should actually make you choose one over the other, rather than choosing some dialogue where both are still your friends.</p><div class='title'><b>Consequence</b></div><p>The idea of Wish Fulfillment dances around the fact that actions have consequence, and we aren't seeing any of these consequences.  That's what Mass Effect's continued Save File persistence throughout the series is supposed to represent.  If you make a decision in a prior game, those decisions come back to bite you in the ass.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 didn't penalize you for making decisions in the first game.  The overall story of ME2 didn't change.  The only thing that changed were certain dialogue choices, and some random people from the first game may make an appearance.  Here's the list of all choices in Mass Effect 1 that had bearing in Mass Effect 2: <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer" title="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer">Save FIle Transfer on Mass Effect Wikia</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect 3 needs to have these consequences finally come to life.  They say they're going to, but they actually have to do it.  And not only that, but make some of your "good" paragon decisions thrown back in your face.  The Paragon/Renegade system isn't about Good v. Evil, it's about Nice v. Mean.  So far you could be either, and it didn't matter.  There needs to be a clear distinction that a Paragon choice you made in the past was wrong, rather than (possibly) making all the Renegade choices wrong.</p><p>Entire areas of the game need to be inaccessible depending on the choices you've previously made.  Certain quest lines should only be available based on your decisions.  And even certain allies in the past, should now become enemies because of something you did.  Mass Effect 3 should be a radically different experience for those who have played through the previous games, rather than just a different character saying different things in place of another character.</p><div class='title'><b>Romance</b></div><p>Romance has been a big part of Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 3 is (supposedly) when all your choices come to fruition.  As male or female Shepard you have 2 choices on who you can get involved with in Mass Effect 1.  In Mass Effect 2, you have 3 choices for either gender, and neither of these choices are the same from the first game.  In ME2, you can cheat on your lover from the first game.</p><p>Well, that's what I did on my first playthrough.  As Female Shepard, I definitely went for Liara, the blue female alien, and then I cheated on her.  I think it was more for curiosity sake if anything because a romance between Female Shepard and Garrus was completely ridiculous.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons I wanted (or needed) to play Mass Effect 2 a second time through was because Liara had a prominent role in a DLC mission, and I wanted to make things right.  The Shadow Broker DLC pack allowed our relationship to continue in Mass Effect 2 in a cute scene aboard the Normandy.</p><div class='title'><b>Alternate Lovers</b></div><p>Outside of those 3 romantic choices in Mass Effect 2, there are 3 (or 4) other instances where you can get physical with other characters.  One of these can only happen if you're male Shepard, and it's with Jack during some random conversation.  The other 2 options are with Samara and Kelly Chambers, both of which I did in addition to Liara in my game.  Like all romances, the more you talk with the character, the more you bond, and the eventual romantic options start to crop up.</p><p>With Kelly, keep talking with her after missions, and eventually you will have the option to invite her up to your quarters for dinner.  This is also beneficial because she was automatically feed your fish for you.  After you complete the final mission, and both of you are alive, talk with her again.  She'll send you an email after the conversation about some private time in your quarters.  Go up to your quarters, and invite her up using the comm system on your desk.</p><p>With Samara, if you continue talking with her after missions, the final step is when she starts to ask about how you feel about her.  You can say "just friends" or "something more" or something like that.  Steer the conversation towards trying to seduce her.  She'll ultimately reject you, but leave her quarters.  You'll find her in the crew quarters next door looking out the window at the FTL drive.  If you talk with her, her response is simply, "Please?"</p><p>I guess there's a fourth alternate romance option, and that's with Morinth.  You can talk her into having sex with you, but this kills you instantly because she's an Adart-Yakshi.  This romance cannot persist because it's Game Over.</p><p>Anyway, after continuing my romance with Liara, then going after Samara, and getting physical with Kelly, the photo of Liara is still standing in Shepard's private quarters.  This photo (on your desk) is your romance from the first game, and if this is tipped over, that means you've cheated.  So, despite sort of cheating on Liara this time, the game doesn't think I've cheated.</p><p>Hopefully this will come back at me in the next game, or at least be touched upon.  If anything, I can say that I've done every possible lesbian relationship on a single save.  High Five.</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect 3</b></div><p>Mass Effect 3 is a mere 3 weeks away!  I'm excited.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DJ Promo #3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dj-promo-3">DJ Promo #3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 11, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, I DJed at a friend's party and made a couple of DJ Promos to commemorate and practice for the occassion. Both of those are available on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock">Soundcloud</a>, and I wrote a post about them: <a href="/old/v7/dj-promos" title="/dj-promos">October 14th</a>.</p><p>With 2 months spacing my two previous mixes apart, I figured that I would continue to make a new promo every 2 months.  That fell through when I didn't have internet for 3 months and wanted to download and use some new favorites, rather than the stuff I already had downloaded.  And then I got a new laptop, and had to reinstall and transfer things over to that.  And I was playing Skyrim every day for 6 hours in the month of December, too.</p><p>So, I skipped December, and here we are in February :)</p><div class='title'><b>Kind of Wintertime!</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/003.webp"  /></p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="100%" height="81" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36255553&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" height="81" src="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F36255553&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object> <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock-003">DyreSchlock 003</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock" title="http://soundcloud.com/dyreschlock">dyreschlock</a></span></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MU2g3NGYtOUJTM3M/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 003.mp3</a></p><p>1. Trentmoller - Shades of Marble (Trentmoller Remix)<br/>2. Booka Shade - Teenage Spaceman (Sei A Bass Remix)<br/>3. Guy Gerber - Timing (Denis Kayron Dirty Hands Remix)<br/>4. Extrawelt - Titelheld<br/>5. Fergie - PCP (King Unique Remix)<br/>6. Henry Saiz &amp; Guy J - Meridian (Original Mix)<br/>7. Ian O'Donovan - Aurora Borealis (Henry Saiz 70's Remix)<br/>8. Max Cooper - Heresy (Dosem Remix)<br/>9. Spooky - Belong (Igor Cold Unofficial Remix)<br/>10. Slacker - Hymn to Her (Lank Bootleg)</p><p>There were some clear cut songs I wanted to include in this mix.  I wanted to end on Spooky - Belong, and I wanted to start with Shades of Marble (Trentmoller Remix).  Almost everything in between came from experimenting with other tracks, and just seeing what worked together.  Originally, I wanted to end on Orbital's new track "Never", but in its current 3 minute state, it is a difficult one to mix into.</p><p>I added Slacker - Hymn to Her at the end as a farewell to DJ Slacker, who <a href="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/" title="http://mixing.dj/2012/livesets/r-i-p-dj-slacker-dies-in-thailand/">passed away</a> in Thailand a couple weeks ago.  I wasn't super familiar with his work, but after listening to some of his tracks, I guess I knew him a little better than I thought.  I remember hearing his music from sets back in the day, and occassionally at The Quest in Minneapolis.  Hymn to Her is definitely my favorite and most recognizable of his, and I found a nice cut of it on Lank's Soundcloud.</p><p>My initial impressions with this mix were a little negative.  It didn't feel like it had an overall message, and it was just a bunch of tracks kind of thrown together.  But as I listen to the results over and over again, I think it turned out pretty well.  I think all the tracks at the beginning flow pretty well, and everything leads up to Henry Saiz's monster remix of Aurora Borealis.</p><p>Give it a listen, and let me know what you think :)</p><div class='title'><b>More mixes</b></div><p>My goal is to continue making these mixes every 2 months. Â Whether it be tracks I hear in the next two months, or some more favorites from years past, I plan on putting something together.</p><p>For me, mixing tracks (or attempting to mix tracks) is a good way of actually feeling how the music actually works with each other, rather than just listening to a single track on its own.  I'm not a DJ, nor do I really claim to be, so I don't really think about music in this way right off the bat.  I might think that two songs sound good together, but in practice they might not jive at all.</p><p>When I'm mixing these tracks together, I'm not doing anything fancy.  I'm really just using the cross fader, and letting the songs naturally mix together.  It's a pretty basic way to do things, and I'm doing it this way because I'm not familar enough with DJ software to do otherwise.  I'm really just sequencing tracks, rather than mixing them together.</p><p>But it forces me to make good decisions, and promote a natural layered flow through the mix.  So far so good.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Local Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-3-local-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Local Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Chicago and Minneapolis had the volume to garner fantastic international talent from all over the world, there was plenty going on right down the street from where I live.  The local scene has exploded over the last year, and we've actually been able to get some international talent as well thanks to the loyal scene in Madison.</p><p>Many events are pretty mainstream, but there are plenty of dudes in the area who have been DJing for more than 10 years, and know exactly where the music today comes from, and what makes the past so special, too.</p><p>Here are my favorite events I attended in town put on by some of the best talent in the Midwest.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Demetri Nocturnal, Psycotron, Scatter @ Poor Boy's Rave, Segredo // Dec 22nd</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/">http://www.facebook.com/events/325890630768309/</a></p><p>No event was more surprising, or amazing than the second to last Poor Boy's Rave of the year.  It was a night of modern Psytrance that continued to be infused with classic Trance hits from the late 90s and 2000 until that beautiful classic sound took over completely.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111222_pbr/IMG_0092.webp"  /></p><p>After Wyatt's opening set, Scatter took the stage and set the mood was some groovy Psytrance beats.</p><p>I don't pay attention to this genre at all, but it was very different than the Hallucinogen and Infected Mushroom I was told were representative of this genre.  Modern day Psytrance (at least according to these guys) was very similar to the classic sound of Trance I was in love with back in the day.</p><p>Scatter continued to hold that classic sound but with a harder edge.  Pyscotron picked up exactly where Scatter left off, but his sound became more melodic and dreamy.</p><p>Demetri Nocturnal took the stage and played a set that was straight out of the year 2000.  I haven't heard these songs in YEARS.  It was like listening to Paul Oakenfold in his prime.  This was exactly the sound I heard in clubs when I first started going out, and the sound that I had completely forgotten about.  It was the reason I went out back in the day, and the reason I have such love for Electronic Dance Music these days.</p><p>I never thought I'd hear this again, and this is why it was the most amazing moment I had in Madison throughout the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>2. The Gimp @ Jump Around, The Cardinal // July 27th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/">http://www.facebook.com/events/137007709711782/</a></p><p>Likewise, one night in July, the Milwaukee Noise Collective was invited to spin at Wyatt's monthy event at The Cardinal, Jump Around.  This was a week before Caleb's big summer party, and I was gearing up to DJ that party all night long.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110727_jumparound/IMG_0186.webp"  /></p><p>A couple DJs started off the night, but when The Gimp, aka Brandon Standal, took over the decks the atmosphere completely changed.  It was another set infused with classic DJ tracks that I hadn't heard since the year 2000, and it built a wonder sound.  I was so happy to be with a bunch of my friends at the time.  This was the sound I wanted to bring to Caleb's party.</p><p>Brandon built up the atmosphere with several tracks and then slammed us with Above &amp; Beyond - On a Good Day.  The original Club Mix, not the slightly harder Metropolis mashup.  It was euphoria.  A perfect blend of old and new.</p><div class='title'><b>3. The Horrorist @ Inferno // May 14th</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/">http://www.facebook.com/events/114602045280522/</a></p><p>This party was definitely the drunkest I had been all year.  My friends and I somewhat pre-gamed at the Come Back Inn with some Boots.  I slammed some Red Bulls, and we went off to Inferno shortly after.  I was drinking Spotted Cow all night, one after the other.  After the event ended, everyone went across the street to an after party on the second story of some supply store.  And we continued partying for another 2 hours probably, I dunno, I don't remember.  I probably got home around 5am?</p><p>All the opening DJs put an entertaining sets that really set the mood for the night.  Some very hard tracks, mostly Electro House and Techno.  As time progressed and the headliner loomed, the sound become very focused on Techno, and continue to bang pretty hard.</p><p>The Horrorist took the stage and started laying down tracks.  He picked up the microphone and provided all the vocals himself.  He yelled and screamed into the mic along with the beat, and the crowd went absolutely crazy to it.  We yelled at the top of our lungs back at him.  YEAHHH!</p><p>Aside from being drunk and manic due to beer and Red Bull, it was definitely the most energetic party I've ever been to in Madison.  The crowd was completely in tune with his performance, and after Inferno closed, the vibe continued at the after party.</p><p>Despite how ridiculously drunk I was, I remember so much of that night.  It's crazy how incredible and unique that night was that it shown through any attempts of memory blindness. Also, it was great to have company with me so we could piece the evening together at a later date.  It was my favorite drunken night of the year :)</p><p>I think that funniest thing about this was that on Monday, I found out that they recorded the audio from the entire night.  After listening to set performed by The Horrorist, it really didn't sound all that great.  It was a fantastic night, but the majesty of it all was really in his stage presence and ridiculous amount energy pumping up the crowd.  That kind of thing doesn't translate to audio so well. :/</p><p>It was a night that you truly had to be there to experience it all.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Alex Hall @ Wobble, Electric Earth // Halloween</b></div><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/" title="http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/">http://www.facebook.com/events/297010756976712/</a></p><p>Alex Hall is a member and featured artist of one of the music forums that I've frequented for quite a while now.  Hybridized.org specialized in Progressive Trance, and Progressive Breaks mostly.  The have huge acts such as Hybrid and Way Out West, but these days focuses a whole lot more on rising talent across the world.</p><p>Alex Hall became a member around the same time I found the forums, but I had no idea he lived in the midwest!  I came across his name on this event, and made it my mission to be in attendance.</p><p>A lot of the Wobble crew threw down some groovy sets, but mixed in some occasion medicore tracks.  One of the openers had some amazing classic Acid House tracks, but then mixed them into Skrillex, bleehhh.  One of the other openers started off with some Drum 'n Bass, and Alex Hall yelled out from the back room, "Drum 'n Bass is for pussies!"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111029_alexhall/IMG_8546.webp"  /></p><p>Alex Hall took the stage as Satan.  This was the same night Wolfgang Gartner was at Segredo, and Alex's opening remarks were, "Who needs Wolfgang Gartner!  Let's Party!".</p><p>He spun a modern techno set with plenty recent huge hits including Pryda - Moksha and Eric Prydz - Personal Jesus.  It was great to hear such big name sound coming from a Wisconsin resident.  He ended on Mike Koglin - Enjoy the Silence and absolutely blew my mind.</p><p>It was a remarkable Halloween night.  Far better than what Wolfgang would've offered. :)</p><div class='title'><b>5. Wyatt Agard</b></div><p>@ The Cardinal (closing out a dead night)<br/>@ Segredo (opening for Halo)</p><p>Through the year, Wyatt has put on a ridiculous amount of shows.  He DJs at various gigs at least 3 or 4 times a week, and sometimes every single day of the week.  He puts on special events at The Majestic, holds a monthly show at The Cardinal, and weekly shows at Jolly Bobs, and Segredo.</p><p>Wyatt's an amazing dude, and there were two moments throughout the year that really popped for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111014_wyatt/IMG_8185.webp"  /></p><p>One late summer's eve at The Cardinal, the place was pretty much dead.  There was a bunch of people there at one point, but never more than 30 people on the dance floor, and eventually they all left leaving me alone out there to groove along.  Wyatt mixed in some of the amazing tracks throughout his set, and built a very progressive vibe.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58ZNUrTjylo">Booka Shade - Regenerate (Pan Pot Remix)</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPdBiePeD8">Moby - Pale Horses (Gui Boratto Remix)</a>, and some mashed up remix of Xpander (or at least it sounded like it.)</p><p>These were all tracks I had been groovy to over the summer, and it was great to hear them live. :)</p><p>Later on, when opening up for Halo Varga, he spun another fantastic Prog set.  And even managed to mix in an actual remix of Xpander, most likely the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbB_QU6JRQ8">Funkagenda Remix</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Events" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-2-events">Favorite Music of 2011 - Events</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Popularity for DJs soured in 2011.  DJs of all genres and tastes are in high demand, and the promoters of Chicago worked their asses off all year round.</p><p>And with the massive success of the North Coast Music Festival in 2010, promotion company React opened up their own night club, The Mid.  The Mid saw an unprecedented amount of talent week after week after week.</p><p>Through the year, the following events were my favorites, and almost all of my favorite tracks of the year ended up on the turntables at them one way or another.</p><div class='title'><b>1. Kings of Progressive House</b></div><p>Nick Warren &amp; Hernan Cattaneo @ Sound-Bar, Chicago // December 16th<br/>Sasha @ The Mid, Chicago // March 12th<br/>John Digweed @ The Mid, Chicago // March 23rd</p><p>All 4 of the best in Progressive House visited Chicago throughout the year.  John Digweed and Hernan Cattaneo stopped by twice!  All of these guys are my favorite DJs, and having the chance to see them all live in a single year absolutely blows my mind.</p><p>But out these nights, Nick Warren and Hernan Cattaneo was the clear Event of the Year for me.  After trying to see Nick live for the past 8 years, the top person on my music bucket list was finally crossed off.  They spun for over 4 hours, and fed off of each other the whole time.  Nick was create some massive builds, and Hernan continued the plateau of that build into his couple of tracks.  Back and forth, back and forth, it was absolutely brilliant.  Here's my words about it from the day after: <a href="/old/v7/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago" title="/nick-warren-hernan-cattaneo-sound-bar-chicago">December 18th</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111216_warren_cattaneo/IMG_9077.webp"  /></p><p>Sasha's set from March was unlike anything I'd heard from him lately.  He had been building up his Never say Never vibe which was mostly Tech House, and Indie tracks.  It was a very light, glowing, and joyful sound from him.  By his March set from The Mid pulled him back into the pure darkness.  It was a dark set filled with Progressive House and Techno.  It completely blind sided me, and carried the rich atmosphere that made me a Sasha fan in the first place.</p><p>Digweed's set from March felt like a showcase of all the talent he would later release in the year.  It was right in the middle of WMC, and it felt like he was road testing a whole lot of tracks for the upcoming weekend.  Among them was my favorite track of the year, Meridian, and many other beautiful and banging tracks.  It was on a Wednesday as well, so the vibe wasn't really as crazy as the weekend, either.</p><p>I kind of wish I would've went down there for Digweed's follow up set in May, but I was busy in Madison that weekend.  Having him on a proper weekend date would have been special. :)</p><div class='title'><b>2. North Coast Music Festival</b></div><p>Carl Cox, James Zabiela, Ida Engberg, Steve Bug</p><p>With PAX scheduled one weekend before Labor Day, I had all weekend to take in Chicago's massive Electronic Dance Music festival.  And I wrote a detailed diary of everything I did that weekend.</p><p>Day 1 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-1" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-1">Friday September 2nd</a><br/>Day 2 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">Saturday September 3rd</a><br/>Day 3 - <a href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-3" title="/north-coast-music-festival-day-3">Sunday September 4th</a></p><p>While it was heavy with mainstream acts, North Coast had so much going on at anyone time, there was something for everyone.  Many of the acts that I attended were refreshing and classic compared to the many Electro House, and Dubstep acts of today.</p><p>James Zabiela spun and scratched some amazing breaky tracks on Friday.  It had been so long since I have heard any breakbeats live, I had almost forgot what they sounded like.  His set at the festival was only a taste of the mayhem he brought to Sound Bar that evening.  He mixed breaks into some amazing progressive house tracks.  It was fantastic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>Carl Cox blew my mind the next day as he performed a massive genre bending set that ripped into the crowd around his stage.  He spun Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz towards the beginning of his set, absolutely ruined the crowd, and kept up that energy and electricity throughout the rest of his set.  It was incredible.</p><p>For an after party, Five and I went to see Andy Moor at Vision.  While not a sanctioned North Coast after party, it was another highlight on my weekend.  It was great to hear harmonizing hard trance that didn't feel too generic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6526_stitch_t.webp"  /></p><p>At the end of Sunday, I went to Transit for a night of that classic House sound I grew up hearing in Minneapolis.  Steve Bug played a solid smooth House set, and Ida Engberg pumped up the energy with her brand of Techno.</p><p>It was a fantastic (and beautiful) weekend, and one of the best of the best of the entire year.</p><div class='title'><b>3. M83 @ First Avenue, Minneapolis // November 16th</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8673.webp"  /></p><p>On a Wednesday in November, I drove up to Minneapolis and finally had the chance to see M83, one of my favorite bands.  I am a huge fan of their songs Teen Angst, Couluers, and their new lead single Midnight City.  The event was part of their tour for their new double length album, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.</p><p>And seeing them live for the first (real) time was a dream.  They played all of their amazing hits from the new album, and all of their amazing hits from their previous album, Saturday = Youth, and plenty of amazing tracks from their past.  Hearing Teen Angst live and Couleurs live had been a dream of mine for a while, and it was another moment of crossing things off my music bucket list.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111116_m83/IMG_8708.webp"  /></p><p>As soon as they started playing Midnight City, all of First Ave was hopping up in the air, and tearing the roof off of the place.  It was tremendous, and a true show of how everyone there was feeling the exact same vibe.  From hipsters to business men, from moms to teens, from loving couples to singles, everyone embraced in the love pounding from the stage.  It was absolutely one of the best moments of the year.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Twisted in Madison</b></div><p>Shpongle @ The Majestic, Madison // April 26th<br/>Ott @ The Majestic, Madison // March 18th</p><p>My favorite psychedelic artists were on tour in 2011, and both of them made their way to Madison for two very special nights.  Twisted is the record label both them are a part of, though I think Ott may have split from them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110318_ott/IMG_1963.webp"  /></p><p>Ott was fresh off releasing a new album, Mir, with the beautiful and surreal track Adrift in Hilbert Space.  He had been to Madison the year before, but his 2011 experience showed a more enthusiastic and motivated Ott.  He was no longer just performing the same songs he already had.  His new album invigorated him, and that energy passed on to the crowd.</p><p>The whole night was a journey into his unique sound, and it was fantastic being there with like minded fans from the area.</p><p>The same thing happened again one month later with Shpongle, aka Simon Posford, label boss of the Twisted label.  Simon took us through a journey of Shpongle's greatest hits mixed in with several tracks from other artists on the Twisted label.  He was DJing in Minneapolis the year before, but to hear him locally at the Majestic with so many other fans was truly special.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110426_shpongle/IMG_2283.webp"  /></p><p>The event was as music visual as it was aural.  Shpongle brought with him the Sphongletron, a unique stage setup the used LEDs, back projectors, and a power front projector that illuminated the Shpongle head on the front of the Sphongletron.  The Shpongle light up during songs, and the lighting moved around the head to give the impression of a physical moving light.  And then!  The head started to move!  The head opened up his mouth, and his tongue started licking around his face.  And then!  The head began to twist and turn along with the trippy music.  At first, I had no idea what was going on.  It looked like the physical statue was moving and contorting on its own.  It was amazing and mesmerizing.</p><p>It was a night as unique as their respective sounds, and fantastic to seem them just down the street from where I lived. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Music of 2011 - Tracks" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-music-of-2011-part-1-tracks">Favorite Music of 2011 - Tracks</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2011 was probably the best year for music for me.  With Electronic Dance Music's popularity at an all time high, the genre has gotten a large amount of attention, and DJs and artists have been working non-stop at getting their names out there, and promoters have been going over the top all year round to bring the world's greatest talent to their city.</p><p>There has been some amazing new music, mixed in with fantastic local talent and events.  Over the course of 2011, I've seen almost all of my favorite DJs and heard fantastic new music, and plenty of oldies as well, and they have opened my ears to some fantastic talent and music that made the perfect soundtrack to 2011.</p><p>Here are my favorite I heard throughout the year.  Almost all of them I was introduced to in a live setting, or later heard them live.</p><p class='img'><b>1. Guy J &amp; Henry Saiz - Meridian</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/01_guy_j_meridian.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl3AawovEoU</a></p><p>This massive track debuted towards the end of the year, but had support from John Digweed since Spring.  As he shopped it around, he knew he was sitting on something big, and made it part of the 100th release on his record label, Bedrock.</p><p>It has beautiful atmosphere that continues to build and build with a unique electricity.</p><p class='img'><b>2. David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/02_david_august_hamburg.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA</a></p><p>Another massive track that Sasha shopped around as part of his Never say Never residency at Ushuaia in Ibiza.  This distinct track always shone through the tracks he was mixing, and was the highlight of a several track build.  It has that perfect summer Tech House feel.</p><p class='img'><b>3. M83 - Midnight City</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/03_m83_midnight_city.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE</a></p><p>From start to finish, Midnight City exudes energy.  It has this classic feel-good sound.  I can't help but smile whenever I hear it.  It's a perfect follow-up to many of M83's other amazing hits, like Teen Angst and Couleurs.</p><p>I saw them at First Ave in Minneapolis, and when they started playing this song, the entire club erupted in cheers, and jumping, and dancing, and smiles everywhere.</p><p class='img'><b>4. Nick Warren - Beunos Aires</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/04_nick_warren_beunos_aires.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDc0W-Epc8</a></p><p>Another distinctive progressive track from the very best in Progressive House.  Beunos Aires has a very smooth undertone that hooked me the moment I heard it.  It guides the track, and them slams you with the melody.  It's a really hard banging track, but the light melody likes to disguise itself as something else.  It's interesting, and works together amazingly well.</p><p>When Nick Warren played this song in Chicago, it made my day.  It made my year.  Different one of my favorite moments I've experienced in Dance music. :)</p><p class='img'><b>5. Maxime Dangles - Dihaiz</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/05_maxime_dangles_dihaiz.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA</a></p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, I would say this is my favorite purely hard track of the year.  When a DJ throws down this track, there's no way to ignore it.  It rips through the scene and everyone pays attention.  The amount of raw energy captured in this song transfers itself to the audience, and mayhem ensues.</p><p>Carl Cox played this one at North Coast and everyone flipped out.  Everyone was on their feet hopping around.</p><p class='img'><b>6. Ott - Adrift in Hilbert Space</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/06_ott_hilbert_space.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/06_ott_hilbert_space.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120106_music/06_ott_hilbert_space.webp"  /><br/>listen : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LuQvTiVfg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LuQvTiVfg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LuQvTiVfg</a></p><p>It starts off for a perfectly light atmosphere, and then that initial guitar riff hits.  It throws shivers down my spine.  The vocals and synth further capture my attention.  And then the song guide me on a journey of sound.  This is definitely one of the most beautiful tracks I've heard all year.  And hearing Ott perform this live was very special.  All the melodic bits pop, and it's an atmosphere I can't escape from.</p><p class='img'><b>7.

| February 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My friends and I just finished the most recent season of Dexter, season 6, last night and was a lot better than any of us expected.  After the lack of direction nor interesting characters in Season 5, we were mostly turned off from the series.  But we picked it up, watched it, and glad we did. :)</p><div class='title'><b><em>Spoilers!</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Season Arcs</b></div><p>I think the reason Season 6 pretty well is that we have an actual fleshed out character as a villain with clear motivation, and actually does plenty of murder throughout the Season.  Seasons 1 and 4 did this perfectly and stand as the best two seasons of the show.  Seasons 2, 3, and 5 strayed away from this and fall very flat as a consequence.</p><p>I think that Season 2 had a pretty tight focus, but the villain was basically Dexter.  Unless you count Lyla, but she wasn't a serial killer at all.  She's just a crazy bitch, which was more of a manifestation of Dexter's dark side.  I think that the suspense of Dexter being caught makes up for the lack of a strong villain, but there still isn't a whole lot of murder going on.</p><p>Season 3 is the absolute worse.  We do have a serial murderer, but he has no character at all.  They never wrote him that way.  He's just a dude who skins people.  Who is he?  I dunno.  Jimmy Smitts as the Season's actual villain, but he's not really a serial killer.  He's just a controlling asshole, and the whole season focuses on that.  Who cares?  Get to the killing.</p><p>Season 4 felt incredibly fresh after the horror of Season 3.  Dexter is out killing again, and his kills actually show his character, and he grows.  I wrote about all that while the season first aired: <a href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4" title="/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">October 20th, 2009</a>.  But we have a clear villain, who does a lot of murder.  Dexter learns from the clues and tracks him down, while the police are closing in as well.  And there's an epic showdown.</p><p>With the story they had laid out for Season 5, I think it was doomed for failure.  They had to deal with the aftermath of Season 4, while still spinning their own plot.  Well, they couldn't just focus on grief the entire season, so they needed to throw a villain in their, too, somehow.  And maybe a love plot, too?  Whatever...  This season focused more on Season 4, rather than itself, and suffered because of it.</p><p>With Season 6, they were able to start fresh.  A brand new villain, with a clear motive, and their story focused on throughout the season.  It was fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>I think they learned from Season 4 a little too much.  If you end with a massive cliffhanger, you instantly pull in the audience and make them care far more than the normally would.  I'm guessing that Season 5 Episode 1 had the highest amount of ratings of any single Dexter episode thanks to the ending of Season 4.  And I expect Season 7 Episode 1 to pull in some serious ratings as well.</p><p>Currently, Dexter is signed on through Season 8.  I expect them to actually finish off the show at Season 8, but who knows what'll happen.</p><p>Also, I expect Season 7 to be somewhat similar to Season 5, but perhaps with a Season 2 edge.  It won't be as sappy, or mistake ridden as Season 5 because Dexter isn't some vulnerable lost sheep.  But the writers still have to deal with the aftermath.  In Season 5, they wrote out almost everything that had to do with Rita, Aster, and Cody, and just moved forward.</p><p>I don't think they can ignore Deb, but I wouldn't put it past them to write her as understanding and accepting.  Which is the complete opposite of what she would actually do.  They have a chance to actually end on a high note, and write an interesting drama filled plot between these two characters, but I fully expect them to fuck it up.</p><p>Who knows...  In any case, I'm fully invested in this show again thanks to Season 6. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis-2">Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 5, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been almost 2 1/2 years since Above &amp; Beyond performed in Minneapolis.  As they took the stage, right before midnight on Saturday, their gigantic LED display started off by saying, "Minneapolis, it's been too long."</p><p>Currently, on tour for their new artist album, <b>Group Therapy</b>, Above &amp; Beyond have visited a lot of lesser known clubs.  I think they intend to have another North American tour later in the year to all the American clubbing hot spots.  They've completely skipped over New York and Florida.  And have found themselves in Indiana, Ann Arbor, St. Louis, and plenty of Canadian areas too.</p><p>I was there in November 2009 when they took the stage and completely reopened my dormant thoughts about the good 'ol days of Trance.  All of their tracks were beautiful, melodic, and completely uplifting.  I was smiling all night.  <a href="/old/v7/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Read all about it!</a></p><p>Last night was a little different though :/</p><p>A lot has changed in Electronic Dance Music over the past 2 years.  Electro House and Dubstep (and other) producers and DJs have brought the music genre into the mainstream, and popularity is currently at a ridiculous high.  Above &amp; Beyond have continued to capture the attention of old fans while still raking in new ones.  Which made for quite a crowded site.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9386.webp"  /></p><p>I've seen Epic (or The Quest) more crowded than it was last night, and still had a fantastic time.  But the crowd was a different beast than what I expect from Minneapolis.  Almost every time I've attended a DJ event in Minneapolis, the crowd is friendly.  They'll give you space, smile at you when you're dancing around, and be quite courteous and mindful of others.</p><p>Kids these days...  It's all pushing and shoving, and crowding out others while making more space for yourself.  Or maybe it's because it feels like the true fans of Minneapolis are STARVED for the type of music that pioneered the scene in the first place.  Now, if a remotely decent international DJ finally makes their back way to Minneapolis, every one remoted interested shows up, nerd or not.  Not to mention the #5 DJ Act in the world, Above &amp; Beyond.</p><p>I expect this kind of behavior from the crowds in Chicago, but Minneapolis?  And at a Trance show?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9371.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9416.webp"  /></p><p>Crowd mentality wasn't the only that has changed since the last time.</p><p>In order to stay relevant, Above &amp; Beyond have adapted to the changes in the EDM landscape with their own sound.  They have somewhat shifted away from the uplifting melodic sounds that blew me away 2 1/2 years ago, to more mainstream modern day trance, ala Armin van Buuren.  Their huge single last year, Sun &amp; Moon, is a perfect example of keeping some hints of melody while totally succuming to hard Trance beats.</p><p>I was very very hopeful, when they began their set with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGkX8gsMT7c">Above &amp; Beyond - Filmic</a>, which is a beautiful track, but it turned into modern trance shortly after.  I was keeping track of everything they played, but it was pretty damn close to the Data Trasmission Podcast ep 200, and their Essential Mix last year.</p><p>Actually, one thing about those two mixes that I found absent in their set last night was the addition of some breaky tracks, or, at least, some breaky soundy tracks.  While the mixes were still modern day trance, it was refreshing to hear some of that mixed into it.  I don't recall hearing any of that last night.</p><p>Blah blah blah, complain complain complain... If I had picked up their new CD and listened to it a little more, I would have certainly been more prepared for modern day Above &amp; Beyond.  They should get Ocean Lab back together and make a follow up to Sirens of the Sea!</p><p>They did play On a Good (Metropolis) Day. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9424.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9455.webp"  /></p><p>I went up to Minneapolis with Fishy and Five.  Five had a great time.  He's more into the modern day Trance sound than I am, so he was absolutely in heaven the whole time.  Fishy was hopping around with her glue sticks (when we actually had a room), and attracted random people here and there.  Also, I was able to meet up with a childhood friend of mine, so the night turned out pretty great. :)</p><p>Once the night finished, Above &amp; Beyond exited the stage and raced back to the merch booth.  They blew right past Five as Jack Trash announced they're signing stuff at the merch booth.  Five turned around and was first in line for signed shit!  So, he picked up a $4 tour poster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120204_abovebeyond/IMG_9481.webp"  /></p><p>Only Paavo and Tony were signing things, though.  The third member, Jono, was not back there.  Actually, I never saw Jono on stage either.  Maybe he was waiting in the bus, or something.</p><p>Also, if you noticed the tour dates on that schedule, Minneapolis was the last stop on a 12-day concert binge for them.  Today was their first day off since last Tuesday.  And these 12 dates are almost the entire tour.  That's pretty crazy.  Though, I suppose if you have 3 members and only 2 of them are up on stage doing the work, it's not so bad.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/reuben-wu-of-ladytron-segredo-madison">Reuben Wu (of Ladytron) @ Segredo, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 22, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Saturday Night, Segredo booked 2 (somewhat) major acts at once for their club.  They have negotiated a monthly (?) residency with Chicago local Dani Deahl, and they were able to get Reuben Wu from one of my favorite bands, Ladytron.  Rather than rescheduling, they just decided to role with it and have them both perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp"  /></p><p>Opening up for them were locals DJ Nick Nice and Mike Carlson.  Mike Carlson played a rather ridiculous set.  I think he fit almost every popular electronic dance genre into his set.  House, Techno, Electro, Electro House, Dubstep, Trance, and a little Acid House.  I (my phone) caught a couple of the tracks.</p><p>Steve Angello - Knas<br/>Freestylers - Cracks (Flux Pavilion Remix)<br/>Wolfgang - Illmerica<br/>Knife Party - Internet Friends<br/>Deadmau5 - Some Chords (i think?)</p><p>I though everything actually worked out quite well. Â Despite spanning all these genres, the whole set was pretty cohesive, and made sense.  It was rather interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dani Deahl</b></div><p>Dani Deahl took over a little bit before midnight.  She seems to have a lot of fans around the Midwest, and doesn't mind traveling up to Wisconsin to plays shows in Madison, or Milwaukee.  I've seen her before, opening up for JFK at The Mid.  That opening set was ok.  It didn't really seem like she was having much fun.  She was holding back.  She had to hold back, being a warm-up DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp"  /></p><p>Last night, she was able to completely let loose, and her set was fun for the most part.  She threw in several popular songs, but had an array of a few deeper tracks that really ripped up the crowd.  Here's some tracks I caught:</p><p>Calvin Harris - Awooga<br/>that Steve Aoki song<br/>iPhone marimba tone<br/>Swedish House Mafia - One</p><p>About halfway through her set, when she played that Steve Aoki song, I think things startedÂ deterioratingÂ for me.  And then she started throwing in more dubstep, and some ridiculous songs choices, like that track with an iPhone marimba tone drop?  What's the purpose of that song?  There's no musical reason for it what so ever.  Is the crowd supposed to laugh and say, "hurrr, it's that sound my phone makes"?  I hate dubstep (brostep).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Reuben Wu</b></div><p>Reuben Wu started around 1, and begin putting Dani's set to shame.  I feel like he started off a little dry, but after a few quick songs he tore into the crowd with a much harder edge.  I recorded the first half hour of his set.  I think it starts getting pretty damn good at the 14 minute mark.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o</a></p><p>I'm not really sure what genre this would be.  It's kinda of a mix of Electro House and Techno, I think.  I'm glad I recorded it because as the night (and drinking) progressed, my memory becomes less effective.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp"  /></p><p>It always interesting to see members of the band spin shit on their own.  I wonder imagine they play music they enjoy and draw some inspiration from.  I don't think Reuben threw in popular tracks to get people to like him.  I think he was a building a set he enjoyed and made sense.</p><p>Also, there was a decent crowd for Dani Deahl as she was throwing down tracks, but after Reuben took the stage, people started to slowly exit the club.  By the end, I think Segredo went from 400+ people down to 100. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Mira Aroyo @ The Rave last year</b></div><p>Apparently, all the members of Ladytron met in clubs in London while DJing back in the day, so I was always interested to hear what that might have sounded like.  Last year in Milwaukee, Mira Aroyo, one of the lead singers, was in Wisconsin as well.</p><p>It was a very odd night.  The Rave shacked her up in one of the side rooms, rather than either main room.  Only 50-70 people showed up throughout the night.  Most of those people were probably friends with the opening DJs.  (and) Beers were stupid expensive because it's The Rave, and that place is garbage.</p><p>Mira's mixing wasn't all that great, and her track selection wasn't very inspired.  She'd play a couple tracks, and then pick a remix of a Ladytron song. Play a few more tracks, then Ladytron remix again.  And the other tracks she played were either Electro, or Electro House, or Dubstep.  Mostly popular stuff.  It wasn't very cohesive, and she failed to build any kind of vibe.  The 70ish people there never really danced, so it was just a bunch of people standing around.</p><p>It was pretty awkward to begin with, but the most awkward moment was when she ended her set.  The crowd applauded, but then DEAD silence.  Mira gave a "Thank you", people clapped again, and dead silence again.  It was the saddest DJ event I've ever been to.</p><p>I like Mira quite a bit though.  I think she's my favorite member of Ladytron.  But after last night, I think Reuben is now my (secret) favorite.  Mira's set was pretty shallow.  And Reuben definitely proved he knows how to take command of the decks.  I'd be real interested to hear Helen and Daniel spin a set, but I doubt I'll ever have a chance to see that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago">Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Just spin all the tracks that give him inspiration from artists he loves and admires.</p><p>As such, the style of music is a bit different than his semi-typical Progressive House tone.  It's more light, semi-upbeat and rich Tech House.  But the feel is still Sasha.  The first time I heard a Never say Never, it was really odd.  The mixing and atmosphere was absolutely Sasha, but the music was all different.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha MixMag CD</b></div><p>You can take a listen for yourself. :)</p><p>For the November Issue of MixMag magazine, Sasha had the honor of developing and releasing a mix for their monthly guest CD.  Leading up to the actual release of the issue, Sasha mentioned heading back to the studio after a summer of traveling and playing various gigs.  And out of that came a few new tracks, along with some edits, and wonderful arrangement.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp"  /></p><p>1.

Out of all the times I've Sasha over the last 10 years, i have NEVER seen his as energetic, on having as much fun, or generally happy to spin his tracks.  He was moving around in the booth all night, shaking hands with the happy people up front, and even gave out his headphones at the end of the night.  (He got them back, though, after he went up for 2 encores.)</p><p>Every other time I've seen him spin, he seems so into the vibe, and stoic that it's hard to tell if he's actually having fun.  Digweed is somewhat similar too.  They stand there the whole night, and build and build, layer and layer.  Perhaps they're too much into the technical aspects of mixing and set building to actually have fun?  Or maybe Sasha feels like he's being pigeon holed into a specific genre, and mixing in other stuff won't work with what he's already built.</p><p>But he was having the time of his life in the booth this night, and it completely fed the crowd.  For being as crowded as it was, everyone had a smile across their face.  Lots of hand shaking, high fives, and hugs.  Sasha's good vibes energized everyone there.</p><p>It was very different than the (semi) normal douchebaggery crowd that tends to show up to a Chicago club.  Maybe the horrible weather scarred them away.  Or maybe because the crowd was 80% dude, there weren't any chicks around to bring out the douchebag clubber within.  Or it could be a combination that resulted in actual Sasha fans braving the weather, and filling the majority of the club.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and was holding my camera in the air the whole time to capture the audio.  All the video is up on youtube right now, with a bit of a tracklist.</p><p>Playlist //<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6</a></p><p>Chris Walsh<br/>0.

| January 5, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Skyward Sword is an odd game for 2011.  There are so many things about that are stuck in the last generation of gaming, yet others that seem to push the series forward as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>Exploration</b></div><p>Despite being billed as a 60-80 hour game, it only took me under 40 hours to finish it.  Granted, I still have a bunch of side quests left, but I don't imagine those'll take me longer than an additional 3 or 4 hours.  With that amount of gametime, you'd think the game would be vast, but it really isn't.  Twilight Princess is definitely spans a larger area, but Twilight Princess is no where near as dense. Â Nearly every inch of Skyward Sword has something to do, and every area has multiple puzzles, plenty of enemies, and lots of little things tucked away in corners for you to find.  It may have been a limitation of the platform that there are only so many of these areas, but there's a lot to do in the tiny space available.</p><p>I miss Twilight Princess' vast open spaces, though.  The distance gave your journey a feeling of majesty and scale.  Your journey took you very far away from home, and into all the reaches of the lands of Hyrule.  In Skyward Sword, you live in the sky, and can (basically) fast travel to 3 separate locations on land.  These locations are never connected, and have almost nothing to do with each other.  BUT, there's plenty to do, and redo.  You revisit them quite a bit throughout the story of the game.  In Twilight Princess, you scarcely revisited areas unless you were on later side quests.  (though, I might be remembering that wrong)</p><div class='title'><b>Story and Character</b></div><p>Skyward Sword is somewhat quirky, but is mystical and has a lot of heart.  I think this is the first Legend of Zelda whose entire story starts from the beginning to the end.  In most Zelda games, you start off in some village and venture out into the world where you encounter evil that is already going on, and are caught up in the middle of it.  Skyward Swords also begins in your hometown, but everything is right with the world.  The evil doesn't show up until a few hours into the game.</p><p>Also, unlike previous Legend of Zelda games, Link and Zelda are very close friends, and have been since childhood.  Every other game, Zelda is the princess of Hyrule, and Link is some peasant overcoming all odds to save her.  Skyward Sword establishes their vast friendship, and makes the journey to save her meaningful outside of destiny.  It's Link's love for Zelda that he continues on, and it makes Skyward Sword incredibly <b>cute</b> and touching in story intense scenes.</p><div class='title'><b>Story Significance</b></div><p>2011 was the 25th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda, and was celebrated with plenty of games.  There were 3 Zelda games released in 2011: Ocarina of Time 3D, Four Swords on DSi and 3DS, and Skyward Sword.  Additionally, Nintendo released a 25th Anniversary art book that encompassed the whole series.  And it had a timeline, too!  Which I mentioned previously: <a href="/old/v7/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline" title="/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline">December 21st, 2011</a>.</p><p class='img'>Here's a better explanation of the timeline:<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Canonically, Skyward Sword is the very first Legend of Zelda story.  It was first officially mentioned in Wind Waker that in each Legend of Zelda game, you're not playing as the same Link and Zelda.  Almost every character is a different person, and these games sometimes take place hundreds of years apart from each other.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: At the very end of Skyward Sword, this struggle between the Hero of light, the Princess, and the King of darkness is set up.  As the God of evil is slain, he decrees that his hatred is eternal and can never be snuffed out.  As time exists, his spirit will hunt down the goddess, and the hero will be reborn.  This conflict is eternal.  He basically spelt out the entire purpose of the Legend of Zelda series as Wind Waker did.</p><div class='title'><b>Nostalgia</b></div><p>The mystical sense of Skyward Sword are all the gods at play.  You are agents of the Goddess, and are literally fighting evil.  It mirrors a lot of the ancient stories that are sometimes told to explain who you are in previous Legend of Zelda titles.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: But the real nostalgia is what you are doing in the second act on the game.  You are tempering and forging the Master Sword.  In Skyward Sword, you are creating the Master Sword.  The same sword used in most later Zelda titles.  It's amazing to think of all the other games I've used this sword, and now I'm creating it!  Though, I feel it would have been more amazing to forge the Triforce, but (apparently) that's something the gods can only make.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: In the end, a section of your town, Skyloft, falls to the surface and forms what it known as the Temple of Time in future games!  Once you vanquish the God of evil, you seal his spirit in the Master Sword and place the sword in the alter of the Temple of Time.  The SAME position where it is later found in Ocarina of Time.  OMG OMG Nostalgia!  I was livid during the ending of Skyward Sword.</p><p>Though, I felt a greater sense of nostalgia when I returned to the Temple of Time in Twilight Princess.  I was actually exploring the same location that existed in Ocarina of Time, and retrieved the Master Sword from the exact spot it was left.  There was an amazing amount of build up, and execution in that dungeon that it was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Skyward Sword has amazing nostalgia but it's really only in the ending.  In Twilight Princess, it allowed me to explore it, and I felt like I was an archeologist.  BUT, these games occupy separate ends of the timeline.  It easy to uncover stuff from the past when playing in the future, rather than playing in the past and creating everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Music</b></div><p>There are some tunes in Skyward Sword that are quite breathtaking, but for the most part the style of music follows the quirky nature of the game.  It's very upbeat, and runs at a perfect pace for the areas you explore in the game.</p><p>BUT, I still like Twilight Princess better.  The Hyrule Field tracks had the perfect ambience and atmosphere that converyed the majesty and queer nature of the game.  Also, the background track for the Sky Temple is the most deformed ambient song I've ever heard in The Legend of Zelda.  It was the first time I had ever stopped playing a Zelda game, and just listened.</p><div class='title'><b>Twilight Princess v. Skyward Sword</b></div><p>Overall, I think Skyward Sword trumps Twilight Princess.  Skyward Sword doesn't waste any space, there's an actual meaningful story in of itself with characters you care about, rather than just THE NEW rendition of Link and Zelda.  Ever more than that, all the characters in the game have character, and play off each other.  The Art direction in Skyward Sword is whimsical, beautiful, and ridiculously colorful.  And most of the music complements it perfectly.  PLUS!  It's actually pretty fun to play on the Wii.  Twilight Princess was unplayed on the Wii, in my opinion.</p><p>I still like Twilight Princess better, though (Gamecube version, obviously).  I haven't played it in 5 years, so I'm probably remembering it better than what it was.  But I loved the idea of a dark, somewhat creepy Legend of Zelda title.  There were gnarly deformed creatures and enemies.  The art direction used a whole lot of light v. dark.</p><p>There are both great games, and I can't wait to see what's next for Zelda on the Wii U.</p><div class='title'><b>1080p Skyward Sword</b></div><p>The Wii U is set to come out this coming Christmas.  It is 1080p, and I HOPE HOPE HOPE that it'll upscale Wii games to that resolution.  The Dolphin emulator currently allows you to play Skyward Sword in 1080p, and it looks absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>Here are some shots from the <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=395121" title="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=395121">thread on NeoGaf</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01_t.webp"  /></a><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02_t.webp"  /></a><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03_t.webp"  /></a><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin04_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin04_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin04_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The Wii only runs at 480p, and it really shows it age.  ESPECIALLY after playing games like Uncharted 3, Batman Arkham City, and Skyrim.  For a Comparison, here are two nearly identical shots: one in 480p, and one in 1080p using Dolphin.</p><p>480p: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-480p.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-480p.webp">http://theschlock.com/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-480p.jpg</a><br/>1080p: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-1080p.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-1080p.webp">http://theschlock.com/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-1080p.jpg</a></p><p>It's a world of difference! I'm not really that big of a graphics whore, but it's definitely noticeable when it feels like you're playing through a stained glass window. Â But anyway, if the Dolphin is any proof, Skyward Sword can easily be upscaled to 1080p and looks fantastic, so hopefully the Wii U will do such things!<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/32">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/30">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
