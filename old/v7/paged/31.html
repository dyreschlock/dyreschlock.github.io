| September 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><div class='title'><b>SPOILERS!!</b></div><p>Catherine is about Vincent.  He's been in a long term relationship with Katherine (with a K) for about 3 years (i think?).  And one day, on April 1st, they are talking in a cafe, and Katherine makes a few passive aggressive mentions about their future.  Later on, at the neighborhood bar, Vincent is chatting up his friends, they take off, and he meets "the girl of his dreams," named Catherine (with a C).  She's the sexiest thing he's ever seen.  After a rough nightmare, he wakes up beside her.  They spent the night together, and now he has cheated on Katherine (with a K).</p><p>While the story makes it out to question your ideas of relationships and love, it really boils down to a morality meter.  Do you want to side with Katherine or with Catherine?  Do you want to pursue your long-term relationship and finally "settle" down, or is this random encounter your ticket out of this jail sentence?  The game poses a series of blunt questions, subtle responses to texts, and responses to other people in similar situations.  Each answer moves to the meter back and forth.</p><p>I should probably mention how I played the game.  I'm not currently in any relationship what-so-ever, and don't really care to be.  I've had love in the past, but I'm over it, and don't really care anymore.  My responses to the life questions posed by Catherine (the game) mirrored this in the beginning.  I was neutral.  I floated in the middle.</p><p>Unfortunately, the game threw a cruel twist at me that I decided to believe.  Katherine said she was pregnant.  That's when my alignment changed and I had to start thinking of kids.  While it's pretty awesome that I personally don't have any kids, given the opportunity of being thrust into fatherhood, I would embrace it.  Someday, I do want kids.</p><p>So from that point on my opinion changed, and my responses to the questions started moving more towards the "stick with your wife" angle.  I was still answering everything as honestly as I could.  I wasn't trying to "game" the system towards any specific ending.  I mean, while I don't really want to be in a relationship right now, if I were in a relationship, I would answer something differently.  And that was reflected in the game.</p><p>These questions are meant to guide you through the story to your ultimate ending, but the story is horribly linear.  Vincent doesn't stand up for himself AT ALL.  He continues to let everything spiral out of control around him with the idea that he has no control over the situation.</p><p>Despite my test responses telling Catherine to fuck off, Vincent continues to sleep with her throughout the week.  While actually talking with Catherine, Vincent doesn't say a god damn word.  The entire game is Vincent constantly thinking to himself about what he should do, rather than actually speaking with Catherine or Katherine.</p><p>How the hell is this guy in a long term relationship when they never see each other, or talk about anything?  Even when texting Katherine, your only choices are bullshit passive aggression.  It's either "I'm sorry" or "Don't worry about me."  You can't actually say anything, or talk about anything.  There's no way of coming clean immediately.  And you NEVER see each other either.  How is this a relationship in the first place?!  A relationship is not some one-sided dialogue.</p><p>Things continue to spiral out of control, and Vincent never does anything about them at all.  It's fucking stupid.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Equally stupid is the way you play the game.  The game takes place over 8 or 9 days.  Each night of the week, Vincent has a nightmare.  The large amount of the game is played during the nightmare, and it's an action puzzle game.  You move around blocks on the wall, and climb up to the tippy top.</p><p>In reality, all men unfaithful men are being subjected to these nightmares.  If you do not reach the top in your dreams, you fall.  And when you fall, you die in real life.  Throughout the course of the game, anyone who dies in the dream, shows up on the news the next day as a new victim of the "curse."</p><p>You can prevent some of these deaths from happening, too.  Vincent meets several other people in his nightmare.  Sharing techniques, and talking about the problems they're facing in real life will help them solve them, and they'll survive the nightmares.</p><p>Catherine (the game) plays off the nightmares as a metaphoric representation of the relationship stress Vincent is going through in his real life.  And it works really well in that context, but it's so divorced from the actual plot that I wish I could just skip it all.  Nothing I do during the climbing sequence has any reflection on the story or plot, so it's completely useless.  You could plug any other type of game during these sequences, and it wouldn't change anything.</p><p>When climbing up these walls, all I can think about is wanting to get back to the real world, tell off Catherine, talk with Katherine and fix everything.  I played the game on <b>Easy</b> difficulty so I could fly through these sequences as fast as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Catherine has 8 endings overall.  Throughout the game, the morality meter is displayed and can guide you towards a specific goal.  You'll either side with Catherine or with Katherine.  You can side with yourself as well by staying in the middle.</p><p>Throughout the final challenge, you are given a series of questions that no longer test your morality, but your resolve to stand by those choices.  These are presented to you as every other question has throughout the game.  They aren't as blunt as saying, "are you sure?".  They are truly (trying) to test if you are honest about your decision.</p><p>Whether you side with Catherine or Katherine, each side of the morality meter results in 3 separate endings.  If you answer everything correctly you get the True ending.  If you fuck up, you get the "Good" ending.  If you fuck everything up, you get the Bad ending.</p><p>I feel rather good about myself that I passed these questions perfectly and was rewarded with the <b>True Katherine Ending</b>.  Though, this is really only by the director's standards.  Given how much Vincent continued to completely fuck up, and his inability to fix anything on his own, I feel like I won the Special Olympics.  If he talked about his problems, this would have been over long ago.</p><p>The other two endings are from not choosing either girl, which is really how I personally live my life.  Katherine threw that baby shit at me, and it made me think about things differently.  It turns out she lied about it.  She was not pregnant.  It's not clear if she actually made all that up, but she is not with child.  And by the time, she revealed this, my answers were already aligned with her.  It didn't matter if the baby was real, because I was ready now.</p><p>Which is absolute bullshit.  The damn game tricked me into being someone else.  From the start I was planning on ditching both of them, but she made me care.  Ugh...</p><p>The ending I got felt fake.  And after watching all the endings on youtube, the <b>True Freedom</b> ending felt like the best one.  It ends with the following quote, <b>"Why would you live life without doing what you want?  That's just a recipe for misery."</b> That's what I do everyday.  I live life how I want to.  But I don't agree that this means a person has to stay single to do what they want.  You can do what you want in life with someone else as well.</p><p>Here's a list of all the endings, and how to get them: <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings" title="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings" title="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings">http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings</a></p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Even though I thought a lot about this game was stupid, I think it accomplished its goal quite well.  It made me question my ideas about relationships, and think about things.  In the end, it's a totally different game than anything else out there, and has more much depth than most others too.</p><p><b>I would totally recommend this game.</b> At 15 hours, it's a perfect weekend game.  And I'm really interested to see how my friends would react in these situations, and what their outcome would be (provided they answer everything honestly).<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okonomiyaki Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okonomiyaki-recipe">Okonomiyaki Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I am a huge fan of Japanese food and cooking.  And while my number one favorite Japanese food is Ramen, my secret favorite is Okonomiyaki (tied with Onigiri).  Okonomiyaki is absolutely delicious, and you'd think that there would be a restaurant somewhere, anywhere in the US that would actually serve this stuff, but you can't find it at all.</p><p>It's not really that hard to make either.  Most Okonomiyaki restaurants in Osaka and Tokyo basically let you make these things yourself.  They'll mix everything in the back, bring it out to you, and give you the opportunity to fire 'em up.   The steps are quite easy.  Dump everything on the grill into a pancake, steam/fry it for 5 minutes, flip it, steam/fry it for another 5 minutes, and you're done.</p><p>Not all Okonomiyaki is made the same, though.  I've been to a few other restaurants that have their own set of instructions.  In Nagasaki, just down the road from Chitosepia, there's an Okonomiyaki vendor that builds the pancake first, then piles on all the cabbage, then all the other ingredients.  In Kumamoto, Dave and I visited a restaurant that had Choboiyaki, the regional version of Okonomiyaki.  They followed similar instructions to the Nagasaki version, except it was twice as large, and folded over in a burrito fashion.  The burrito was sliced up, and you ate those pieces.  Here's the blog post: <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=884</a></p><p>I didn't want to do anything that complicated with my own rendition.  I don't even have a flat surface to fry these on anyway.  I'm using a wok.  For my recipe, I started using the instructions from here: <a href="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html" title="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html" title="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html">http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html</a></p><div class='title'><b>Ingredients</b></div><p>All you need is the following: Okonomiyaki Mix, Water, Eggs, Cabbage, Green Onion, Bacon, Okonomiyaki Sauce, Japanese (or Kewpie) Mayonnaise.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Equipment</b></div><p class='img'>You'll need a measuring cup to measure the flour and water, and you'll need a mixing bowl to mix everything in, along with a whisk to do the mixing.

If you have an amount of mixture left that hasn't covered cabbage.  Add more Cabbage.  Chop up (or mince?) 2 stalks of Green Onion.

Try and flattened it out a little bit, but make sure to keep it as a circle.  When satisfied, take 3 strips of Bacon.  Cut them in half.  And cover the surface area of the pancake.  Then cover the pan, and let the pancake steam/fry for 5ish minutes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7246.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7243.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7244.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Step 3.

I think dividing the mixture into thirds would have worked out much better than halves, but it was much better than my first attempt.  The mushrooms, pepper, and onion contributed so much to the overall texture of the pancake.  It was quite good.</p><div class='title'><b>Salmon!</b></div><p>A couple of weeks ago, I bought some Smoked Salmon from the Public Market in Seattle, and figured it would be the perfect ingredient for Okonomiyaki.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp"  /></p><p>I read a little tip online on how to introduce Salmon into the mix, and it worked out pretty well.  The following steps details what I did.  Start doing these steps just after Step 1 at the top.  Also, for veggies I used 3 stalks Green Onion, 1/2 White Onion, and 1/2 Red Pepper.</p><p><b>1. Cook the Salmon.</b> I think it's always a good rule of thumb to cook the meat before adding it to anything you may consume.  I basically crumbled and mashed it all up in the pan though.  I basically turned the salmon into fish flakes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp"  /></p><p><b>2.

Leave 1/3 of the salmon in the pan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp"  /></p><p><b>3. Pancake!</b> Put your pancake mix over the 1/3 salmon remaining in the pan so you have a layer of salmon on the bottom, and a layer of bacon on the top.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp"  /></p><p>Oh my god, this turned out the best of the 3.

So, Five and I took the train and headed downtown for the afternoon.</p><p>We finally go the chance to visit Wow Bao, an Asian fast food place that Five had wanted to go to for a very long time.  We had some lunch, and took a tour of Grant Park and Millenium Park.  We took pictures of the bean and the fountain.  After that, we headed to Rotofugi to take a look at some art and toys.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I love this shot.

And everyone threw their hands in the air, and hopped up and down, which created a massive dirt cloud.  Yesterday, the rain and the crowd had turned the park into a mud pit, and today all that mud had dried into dirt.  And now that dirt is in the air, along with all the horrible cigarette smoke.

It was nearly identical to his set from early 2010 in Minneapolis.  He opened with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao">ATB - Ecstasy</a>, and followed up with boring trance, all the while sampling (teasing) his classic track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4">ATB - 9pm (Till I Come)</a>, which he never fully played.</p><p>ATB is the king of mediocre trance.  There's no way he could follow Andy Moor from last night.  And you could tell he had to fall back on pandering to the crowd when he played the Woo Hoo song (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk">Blur - Song 2</a>).  Really?!</p><p>I find it rather odd that ATB is the only representation of Trance at North Coast, and he's not even that good.  They couldn't find anyone from Armada or Anjuna that wasn't busy this weekend to play some decent trance?  They had Paul van Dyk last year for gods sake...</p><div class='title'><b>Benny Bennasi</b></div><p>ATB finished his horrid set, and left the stage to <b>Benny Bennasi</b>.  His sound was very raw and energetic.  He primary sticks to Electro House, but his sound is very Club House or Big Room or whatever you call it.  Unlike horrible hacks like David Guetta, he kept to a cohesive beat, which makes it actually danceable.  It fits the festival perfectly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>But I think the weekend had started to takes its toll on me.  After a fantastic Day 1 and 2, with nothing really going on for Day 3, and horrible ATB, I wasn't feeling the vibe at all.  I wanted something that actually spoke to me and set itself apart.</p><p>I stuck around for almost his whole set before wandering around the fest grounds again.  I should have left earlier so I could've caught <b>Of Montreal</b>, but oh well.  I didn't feel like staying for Bassnectar or Thievery Corporation, so I left to find some more delicious Chicago pizza at Gino's East.</p><p>I returned to Union Park just in time to hear the closing sounds of <b>Bassnectar</b> on the main stage, but I was outside of the park at the time.  I was waiting in line for tonight's after party at Transit.</p><div class='title'><b>Steve Bug &amp; Ida Engberg @ Transit</b></div><p>I've been to most clubs in Chicago, but I had never been to Transit before.  It had a very different floor plan than all the places I'm used to.  The only club that I could compare it to is Trinity in Seattle.  It had 3 completely separate rooms stacked with some major underground talent.</p><p>Kate Simko, DJ Heather, and rave-legend Woodie McBride ran things in the red room off to the side.  While a few other Chicago DJs opened for Minneapolis legends Jack Trash and Tyler Hampton in the loft room off to the other side.</p><p>The main room was in the center of the club.  The DJ booth was off to the side, and played itself off as an unimportant decoration.  The real focus was the circular dance floor in the center of the room.  It was aligned with VIP seating, speaker towers, sub woofers, and ceiling speakers.  Once you entered the circle, the sound was immense.  There were very few places you could escape the full wrath of sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp"  /></p><p>This night was incredibly nostalgic for me.  The openers in the main room played the type of House music that I grew up hearing in Minneapolis events.  It felt like all the non-Trance DJs in Minneapolis knew everything there was about House and nothing else.  At the time, I really wasn't into it.  The beat just kept going and going and going.  It changed when tracks changed, but it never really evolved into something else.</p><p>Though, when <b>Steve Bug</b> took over the decks that classic House sound definitely evolved.  It moved from repetition to something more layered and spacey, but kept the classic nature.  He blew those openers out of the fucking water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp"  /></p><p>He is different, and hard to describe.  It like someone switched off the "suck" in the club, and made it awesome.  Those openers weren't in the same league as this guy.  Not even close.  He pounded the club with some jagged smooth beats.  It was definitely a surprise.</p><p>The crowd didn't really seem to notice for some reason.  It was really a somber night for the kids in Transit.  Most of the club was dancing and hanging out, but no one was really whipping them into shape.  The club's layout really didn't put an importance on the DJ, so maybe it was better to create a vibe to enjoy, rather than pander to the crowd and make them pay attention.</p><p>I have a feeling that Steve Bug was holding back just a little bit.  He created an amazing atmosphere, but he wasn't tearing down the place.  I think he left that for <b>Ida Engberg</b>, because the crowd totally changed when she took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp"  /></p><p>She finally showed up around 2am, and started off a track or two that built off of Steve Bug's atmosphere.  It was electric and energetic.  The crowd started hopping up and down, and cheering her on.  So she reciprocated by bringing the thunder.</p><p>The rest of her set tore the place down and everyone went nuts.  Everyone in the whole club was on the dance floor, and completely ignored the DJs in the other rooms.  I didn't even realize there were this many people in the club.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp"  /></p><p>I rocked out to her set for about an hour.  I left around 3am, as it had been a long exhausting (amazing) weekend, and I had 150 miles to drive in front of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>This had been one of the best weekends out of the year for me.  It's really hard for me to choose between heading to Seattle, visiting Ace &amp; Jess, and attending PAX, versus heading down to Chicago for North Coast.  Both are the best weekends, and I'm really glad PAX was held one week earlier this year.  Last year, I did half North Coast and half PAX and I feel my overall experiences of both were lessened.  This year, I attended the full breadth of both and they really can't compete with each other.</p><p>As mentioned, James Zabiela and Carl Cox were total stand outs for me, along with Ida Engberg and Steve Bug following them up.  I hope that next year, North Coast is able to bring the amount of variety and quality they had this year.  Also, I hope they fucking bring more than ATB to represent trance, ugh...</p><p>In terms of numbers, I read that they were able to get 50,000 people into Union Park this year, which is 10,000 more than last year.  They should have plenty of cash to make next year even bigger.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">North Coast Music Festival - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They don't stick with the cookie cutter warble waaahhh.  They iterate on that, and keep a coherent beat.  It's actually danceable!  Maybe that's because they mix in a fair amount of Electro House behind their songs, along with some Drum &amp; Bass.  They threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg">Skrillex - Reptile Theme</a> near the end of their set.

These guys are a live electronica band.  They play drums and saxophone over a pre-recorded beat, and have a very unique sound.  Some songs are dubsteppy, and others are more dancey.  It's a very 80s/90s feel.  I like it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Next up, I went over to the Groupon Stage for <b>Future Rock</b>.

The festival grounds are lined with several food tents from local restaurants and bars.  I had some egg rolls, and fish and chips.  Delicious and fatty fried foods.  Perfect for filling the stomach.</p><div class='title'><b>Carl Cox</b></div><p>Carl Cox was pretty damn awesome. :). You don't really hear his name much these days, but he's been around since the beginning.  Along with Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and John Digweed.  They built the English dance scene in the 90s.  This is my second time seeing him and it's been almost 10 years.  The first time was for his Global CD tour in 2002.</p><p>It's interesting to see how he's evolved.  He was pretty much straight House back in the day, which is all I heard from the clubs.  As people ages and tastes changed, the pure House sound has become somewhat niche, and I never hear of it anymore.  It seems that Carl Cox has evolved passed that and has become a renaissance man.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>His set tonight was genre breaking.  While his set was penned in an overall Housey tone, he threw in some Techno and Trance to bring everyone up to speed with the best that is out there.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">Maxime Dangles - Dhiaiz</a>!!  While it was all over the place, it was cohesive.  It made sense, and worked well.  It was fantastic. :)</p><p>I captured the whole set on video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1</a></p><p>While James Zabiela rocked my world yesterday, Carl Cox surprised and delighted me.  <b>These 2 guys are the clear highlight of North Coast for me.</b> I almost regret not going to his after party at The Mid.  But his was one of the first to sell out, so that club will be a crowded mess.  And it's usually that way on regular nights, so I think I'm better off heading off to Vision for Andy Moor.</p><div class='title'><b>Fatboy Slim &amp; STS9</b></div><p>Ending the night at the festival was <b>Fatboy Slim</b> headlining.  Unfortunately, he didn't really do anything for me.  Carl Cox completely blew me away, and anything else that followed needed to go further.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have not followed Fatboy Slim's music what so ever.  I know Star 69, but that's about it.  I can't really groove to his sound.  I listened to his promo mix for the Big Beach Festival in Tokyo earlier his year, and it didn't really speak to me, so I figured this performance would end up the same way.</p><p>It was really more of a concert anyway, rather than a DJ set, or even a festival DJ set at that.  But that crowd went absolutely nuts, and that's awesome.  It's good to see a legend of electronic music get the respect he deserves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp"  /></p><p>I took off a little early and listened to <b>STS9</b> for a little while, but they didn't really grab me either.

Hell yeah.</p><p>For the first time, We took the train into town rather than spend $20 or $30 on parking.  SO MUCH CHEAPER.  $2.75 train in town, $15 cab back to the car.  If we planned it better, we could've taken the train back.  This is my plan next time.</p><p>Anyway, we arrived at Vision around to some lack luster trance openers.  They played a few popular anthems, but kept the vibe in control and ready for The main act.</p><p>Andy Moor took the stage around 2am, I think.  He started off quite solid.  I didn't recognize many of the tracks, but it was a solid vibe.  He kept the energy up, and never fell into that stereotypical trance pattern.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp"  /></p><p>About an hour in, things began to change.

It took them a couple of minutes to fix that, and then he was off.  His set included many of his hits, so it felt much like a concert than a DJ set.  His filler tracks were not for me... I thought I liked this guy, but his set was very uninspired.  No where near what his essential sounded like.  It was pretty disappointing...  though maybe he was nervous and played it safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's the first 16 minutes of him on stage: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g</a></p><p>While he was jammin his hits, the crowd began to grow immensely.  There was a good amount of area to move at the start, but after 15 minutes, it was wall to wall bodies.  Hot sweaty half-naked bodies dripping with sweat from the 90, 95 degree weather.  I wore the wrong clothes to this pit, so I got out of the crowd to avoid drenching my night club garb.</p><p>Wolfgang finished his set in an hour with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q">Wolfgang Gartner - Undertaker</a>, then exited the stage to make way for <b>David Guetta</b>.  David Guetta is a horrible sellout producer who doesn't know how to DJ.  He can sequence songs, but everyone can do that these days.</p><p>He got up on stage and starting blaring the most generic EDM.  It was probably some track he's known for.  The words "Nothing but the beat" scrolled on the LCD display, so that can probably ID the song.  As the song built, he constantly interrupted the track by telling the crowd how this is his biggest gig in Chicago, and how we're all lucky, or whatever.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>As soon as the generic beat dropped, I took off.  I don't need to hear this.  Also, the weather was quite nauseating.  It was 90 some degrees with absolutely NO wind, so all the cigarette smoke stayed around the entire crowd.  From the setting, you'd think the were blowing smoke machines, but it was all disgusting cigarettes.  The worst smell in the world, coupled with some of the most horrible sounds in the world.</p><p>So, I left and went to Lou Malnati's for my favorite Chicago pizza, before heading back downtown for Zabiela's after party.</p><div class='title'><b>James Zabiela @ Sound-Bar</b></div><p>After eating a whole deepdish pizza, I took off for downtown and made it to the Sound-bar line around 11pm.  I was met by a line around the block, and it took about 50 minutes to make it into the club.  I finally made it in around Midnight, and had to pay a $10 cover, but it was worth it.</p><p>Sound Bar was exactly how I remembered it.  This place had not changed in the last 7 years.  Speakers lined the entire dance floor, so no matter where you were, you were standing in the best spot to hear the music.  And it is loud.  SO LOUD.  But the music is still crystal clear.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp"  /></p><p>As I entered, there was a couple in the booth tag teamin opening duties.  It was pretty cute, and they played some of the smoothest Prog House, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</a>.  The set already felt close to Sasha's Never say Never sound, but the plucked that one directly from his latest Usiaha set.  Man, I love that song.</p><p>Halfway through, the guy took over for a couple songs and ramped up the intensity.  One of the songs was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8">Moby - Raining again (Steve Angello Remix)</a>.  Once the girl got control of the decks, she seemed a little annoyed and quickly pulled it back into an amazing groove.</p><p>These two were pretty awesome.  I must know their names.

There was a point where I had been to every sushi restaurant in Madison, but in the last 4 years several new places have emerged. The Osaka House poised itself on being new, but after our visit it is merely a satellite restaurant of Edo Restaurant.  Edo is located in Monona, and is where my coworkers and I go for sushi because it's the closest.  Osaka House had the same new menus that Edo has.  They even said 'Edo Restaurant' on the cover.  But anyway, this is all good because Edo Restaurant is quite delicious.</p><p>I ordered a bunch of rolls that sounded delicious, and I noticed a super cheap roll under the vegetarian options:  Asparagus Sushi, $3.  Hell, how could I pass that up.  Out of the whole night, I would say this roll was the stand out for me.  Though, not because it  was better tasting than anything else I had, but because I had no expectations for it.  I mean, $3 and purely vegetarian?  How good could it be?</p><p>But it was surprisingly good, and incredibly simple.  Just a single Asparagus stalk in rice.  Fuck, I could do that.  I've tried making sushi before, with disappointing results, but how could I mess this one up?</p><p>Now that I'm settled into my new place, I took a look at a few recipes online, and found the following recipe for preparing Asparagus (&lt;a href="http://embitca.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Cook-Asparagus"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and sticky rice (&lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/how-to-make-perfect-sushi-rice/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Make the two separate, and then combine.</p><p>Tonight, I invited two of my friends over, Kate and Fishy, and attempted to make them dinner.  So, here's what I did, and here's what I learned:</p><div class='title'><b>Asparagus Sushi Recipe</b></div><p>Here are all the ingredients you'll need</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp"  /></p><p>Black Pepper, Salt (I used Garlic Salt), Rice Vinegar, Balsamic Vinegar, Sugar (I used Honey), Olive Oil, Asparagus, Dried Seaweed (aka Nori), and Rice.</p><div class='title'><b>1) Make Rice</b></div><p>The first thing I did was make 2 cups of rice, because, out of all the steps, that takes the longest.  I have a rice cooker specifically for this task, but you can make the rice however you want.  Just make sure to <b>wash and clean</b> your rice, or else all the dust and dirt will get baked in and you lose a lot of flavor.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>2) Prepare Asparagus</b></div><p>I laid out all my Asparagus on a flat baking pan.  I covered the pan with some Aluminum Foil to save me from some extra clean up down the road.  On top of the Asparagus, I drizzled some <b>Olive Oil</b>, doing my best to coat the veggies.  Next, I did the same with a little bit of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  Followed by some <b>Black Pepper</b>.  And concluding with some <b>Balsamic Vinegar</b>.  With all the seasoning scattered on top, I started tossing all the Asparagus together to mix all the ingredients and to properly coat everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>3) Roast Asparagus</b></div><p>Rather than steam or pan fry the Asparagus, I went with the Roasting route as that recipe suggests.  I preheated the over to 400, and dumped the whole pan inside.  After a while they start to simmer and smell really really good.  After 10 minutes, I took a single piece and tried it.  Not quite finished.  We decided to leave them in there another 5 or 7 minutes. We probably should have left it in there a little longer than that, but it turned out alright.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>4) Sticky Rice Mixture</b></div><p>While the Asparagus were baking, I made the mixture for the sticky rice.  In the little pot, I combined the 1/4 cup of <b>Rice Vinegar</b>, 1/4 cup of <b>Honey</b>, and 2 tbsp of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  I didn't measure any of this, I just eye-balled it.  I turned on the stove to #4, which heated the mixture really fast.  The recipe says to mix everything until the powder has dissolved in the liquids, and then you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>5) Sticky Rice</b></div><p>With the mixture complete, simply add it to the rice, and mix mix mix.  While the White Rice is naturally very sticky, this mixture will start breaking it up a bit, and make the rice much more manageable, and delicious.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>6) Combine!</b></div><p>Putting Sushi together is the easy, and the most fun part of this whole recipe.  The more challenging parts (to me) are correctly preparing everything to put inside the sushi.  To make sushi, start with the <b>Nori</b>, lay down the <b>rice</b>, put the <b>ingredients</b> on the rice, roll them together, and that's it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp"  /></p><p>Though, you might find that quite difficult just using your hands to place everything together.  The rice will stick to anything dry, so the trick is to constantly wet your hands.  You can have a bowl of water to dip your hands in, or I just use water from the tap.</p><p>Wet your hands, grab some rice, stick in on the Nori, and continue until you have a line of rice.  Place the ingredients in the center most portion of the rice.  With your hands, roll the Nori and completely surround the rice.  Roll it all the way around so you have a tube.  Surround the tub with the bamboo roller, and tighten it up.  Hold it for a couple seconds so the heat can penetrate through all the layers of the Nori, and fuse it together.  Then release, and you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp"  /></p><p>With a super-sharp knife, you can segment the roll into individual pieces.  But my knife is somewhat dull right now, so we just chowed down on the rolls as is.</p><div class='title'><b>Lessons Learned, and solutions!</b></div><p>After eating that first roll, there were 2 problems...</p><p>The <b>first</b> problem was that you could hardly taste the asparagus.  If you notice that first image under combining, I only used 3 stalks in a roll.  The rice totally overpowered the sushi.  To solve this I used twice the amount of asparagus, and it turned out so much better.</p><p>The <b>second</b> problem was that I didn't clip the asparagus.  One step that I skipped from the Roasted Asparagus recipe was cutting off the fibrous wooden stem that cannot and should not be eaten.  The video made mention of the point between food and stem was the snapping point.  Hold on a stalk and break it with both hands.  Where it breaks is where you want it separated.</p><p>After solving these two problems, I thought they turned out delicious.  Though, I don't think my lady friends were impressed.  This isn't exactly gourmet food.  Plus, I don't have any furniture in my apartment, so we ate on my carpeted floor.  This was the <b>third</b> problem, I think.  Also, if I had dishes, then we could've made use of <b>soy sauce</b>.  Also, I was missing some <b>wasabi</b> and <b>ginger</b>.</p><p>But whatever.  This is some delicious food that was easy and quick to make.  Barring the 30-40 minutes it takes to make 2 cups of rice, everything else was about 20 minutes.  And most of the steps can be done concurrently, so once the rice is done, you can start rolling.  Though, you may want to wait 10 minutes for the rice to cool, or else you'll burn your fingers.</p><p>Also, going by this recipe, I yielded 7 rolls.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX Prime 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-prime-2011">PAX Prime 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>The annual Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle is this weekend.  This has been creeping up on me.  After moving into a new apartment, the last few weeks have been busy and just flew by, and I almost forgot about this.</p><p>At the beginning of August, they released the panel schedule, and over the last few weeks, game studios have been issuing press releases on all the games they plan on having in the exhibition hall.  Everything seems to be coming together, and I'm definitely excited.</p><p>Here's some of the panels (and events) that I plan on attending...</p><p><b>1up Presents: Retronauts v. Your Fondest Memories</b> - Friday 3pm @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Although I don't listen to retronauts anymore, their live podcasts are always great.  Jeremy Parish and Chris Kohler have an incredible wealth of gaming knowledge, and they're joined by Jeff Green this year, which should add some extra humor to the mix.</p><p><b>Minecraft Adventure Update Q&A and Demo</b> - Friday 3pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch hosts a Q&A for the upcoming Minecraft 1.8 patch, and plays through a demo.</p><p><b>After Party w/ The Protomen</b> - Friday 8pm @ El Corazon<br/>An intimate after party with one of the best video game music groups!  Openers include Jonny Nero Action Hero, and Klopfenpop.  Hosted by Fangamer.</p><p><b>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'</b> - Saturday 10:30am @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Though I'm not really fan of Destructoid people, Ashley and Anthony Burch, along with their father, form a hilarious sibling rivalry over specific games.</p><p><b>Irrational Games</b> - Saturday 2pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>It's been over one year that Irrational Games unveiled their upcoming title BioShock Infinite, the pseudo sequel/prequel to their 2007 hit game BioShock.  The panel is lead by Ken Levine as he discusses the development process, what we're seen already of BioShock Infinite, and they'll probably play through the E3 demo on stage.</p><p><b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> - Saturday 3:30pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>One of the biggest and most hyped games of this upcoming season is the new Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim.  Bethesda devs take the stage, and most likely will run through the QuakeCon demo on stage.  Super excited for this one.</p><p><b>Square Enix Presents...</b> - Saturday 7pm @ Pegasus Theatre<br/>Squaresoft is heading a panel as well, and they will be unveiling a brand new title.  This title is Airtight Games upcoming FPS from creative director Kim Swift (creator of Portal, and director of the Left 4 Dead games).  While I don't give a shit about Square anymore, I'm quite a fan of Kim Swift.  Can't wait to see what it is.</p><p><b>Minecraft Griefer Party</b> - Sunday 5:30pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch is tearing down the Minecraft booth and giving away pieces of it as souvenirs.</p><p>Nothing else really caught my eye.  It seemed like there were a lot more interesting panels at PAX East this year (<a href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced">reference</a>).  It's also annoying that there isn't a Chiptune showcase.</p><p>But that's fine.  My time at PAX is almost always spent in the exhibition rooms standing in lines waiting for games.  This year there is a huge amount of upcoming games I'm interested in and all of them plan to be at PAX.  These include <b>House of the Dead</b>, <b>Team ICO Collection</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls Skyrim</b>, and <b>Zelda Skyward Sword</b>.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml">this list</a>, there will also be indie game <b>Fez</b>, upcoming Suda 51 / James Gunn game <b>Lollipop Chainsaw</b>, <b>Batman Arkham City</b>, <b>Mass Effect 3</b>, Grasshopper published titles <b>Sine Mora</b> and <b>Black Knight Sword</b>, and Sony will have <b>Playstation Vita</b> units to demo too.  Mojaang (Minecraft) has a booth too!</p><p>It should be an amazing fun time.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Added stuff about Minecraft from their <a href="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/">schedule</a><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
