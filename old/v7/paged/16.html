That's really only the building you see in front of you.  Attached is an aquarium, which seems like the real attraction.</p><div class='title'><b>Dolphin Show</b></div><p>After going through the gates, you're presented with a dolphin training tank.  I got there as the 1:15 show was about to being.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5963.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5963_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5963_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5964.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5964_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5964_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5964_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trainers gave their commands, and the dolphins swam around, and jumped around.  They did their tricks and got their small treats as rewards.</p><p>After watching <a href="/old/v7/the-cove" title="/the-cove">The Cove</a> all those years ago, I can't stop thinking about the well-being of these dolphins, or really any animal in captivity.  The Cove made mention that dolphins communicate and hear through echo-location and sound.  The subtle reverberations of their pings bouncing off walls and objects in the open water to give them a sense of location.</p><p>In a tank, they're obviously trapped and surrounded by sound.  What's worse is the sound of the announcer from the speakers blaring overhead.  And the crowd clapping and cheering them on.  It can be sensory overload for a dolphin or   a porpoise.  Many captive dolphins commit suicide, or damage themselves by ramming into the sides of their tank to try and make the pain go away.  At least, for ones caught in the wild.</p><p>I think there's some law enacted that states dolphins, orca, and other porpoises can no longer be caught in the wild for the porpoises of captivity because it's so damaging and harmful to them.  Only sea-mammals born and raised in captivity are allowed to be kept in captivity.  </p><p>This is probably directly because of their echo-location senses.  Being born and raised in captivity allows them to live with the noise their entire life, and adapt from the very beginning.  Though, this means they could never be released in the wild.  We've basically split their species on a different evolutionary path, much like dogs and wolves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But, they flip around and jump around, and everyone claps.  I wonder what actually compels these dolphins to obey.  They are just animals, but they're smarter than most.  Smarter than dogs.  I wonder if they have some kind of loyalty gene as well, and since we've had them in captivity long enough, those loyalty genes have been passed on to their offspring, continuing the cycle, breeding a more loyal dolphin.</p><p>At some point, this gets just as perverse as dog breeding.  Though, the real perversion of this place is to come.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Enclosed Bay</b></div><p>Passed the dolphin tanks is an enclosed bay connected to the ocean.  In this bay are their larger dolphins and porpoises.  Despite being in captivity, at least closure is actually natural and attached to the ocean.  There's no need to chlorinate or chemically alter the water to produce their natural habitat.  They're just roped inside.</p><p>Here you can walk along those floating docks in the middle of the bay, and get really close to the animals.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6031.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6031.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6031_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6031_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6031_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6018.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6018_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6018_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6018_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>At the entrance to these docks, you may buy some treats to feed these dolphins, so they're all very friendly.

Successfully capturing and killing one of these massive creatures could easily feed the town for months.  Back in the day, whales used to come quite close the coast.  Hundreds of years ago, there were very few large ships patrolling the oceans, and there were all made of wood.  They were no mechanical noises to ward away the creatures of the sea.</p><p>The hunters of the village, would get into smaller boats (models shown above), and extend very large nets between multiple ships.  Once a whale was captured in the nets, and they could get close, the hunters repeatedly stabbed and skewered the beast with their spears.  Eventually wounding it enough, to be pulled onto the beach, and killed.</p><p>Such effort must have taken almost an entire day.  Even when killer whales kill a seal in the open ocean, it takes about 8 hours before they've beaten it enough for it to quit fighting back.  Only once the hunters have destroyed the whales will to live, could they drag it close enough to the beach to finish the job.</p><p>Extended in the middle of the building was a 1:1 scale of the hunters preparing to attack their prey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The area showed some of the more modern equipment used to kill whales, but it was small in comparison to their traditional hunting methods.</p><div class='title'><b>Biology</b></div><p>The middle floor focused on the biology of the sea mammals.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first corner had several internal organs of whales.

And child today can look directly at them, and instantly understand the process of life.  "Authentic" materials, as it were.

Sometimes as a collector, you have some items or something that you always keep in the back of your mind, but never really ever hope in actually finding.  You never really go searching for it anymore because you've hit too many dead ends, and it becomes more of a waste of time than anything else.</p><p>About a week ago, I had some free time on the Internet and randomly decided to search for "Crystania" on yahoo auctions.

Well, it's not the anime itself that's important, but that my friends and I re-wrote, and re-dubbed the movie over 10 years ago as part of our anime club in college.  Really, even calling it "The Legend of Crystania" feels weird as "The Secret of Crystania" is the real treasure.  Honestly, to this day, I still don't know the actual names of the characters other than Ashram and Pirotess.</p><p>We originally finished and screened The Secret on March 6th, 2006, so it was only last week that we hit the 10 year anniversary of our project's "completion."

This philosophy is evident in Japanese arts such as poetry, singing, calligraphy, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, where the names of the art includes the suffix <i>dou</i>.  Budo is another example.  Budo is a system of armed and unarmed fighting techniques, but martial arts and skills alone do not constitute budo in the philosophical sense.  Actual fighting techniques were called <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> and were considered distinct from budo.</p><p>The goal of <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> is to defeat an opponent but this is not necessarily the case in budo.  Naturally, budo practitioners also train to defeat an opponent, however that is just one part of the process of achieving the larger goal of self-development.  Put simply, in budo, as with training in other <i>dou</i> arts, perfection of one's character is the ultimate objective.</p><p>An individual who has achieved excellence in a particular field may be called a <i>meijin</i> (master) or <i>tatsujin</i> (expert).  While the terms <i>meijin</i> and <i>tatsujin</i> refer to the technical proficiency of the individual, the terms may also be used to refer to an individual who possesses unique traits and is recognized as being wise or holy, such as Confucius or Buddha.  Budo as a form of <i>dou</i>, provides the practitioner with a 'path' or means to achieve the enlightened awareness of a wise or holy person.  If, through achieving a high degree of self-development, a person has attained some desirable attribute, then we call this personality trait their 'virtue' (<i>toku</i>).  There are many difference kinds of virtues that people try to develop in themselves and these values are generally universal.  However ethnic, cultural, and religious groups often differ in their opinions on which virtues are the most important.</p><p>Fundamental virtues of particular importance are called 'cardinal virtues' (<i>gentoku</i>).  In Christianity, faith, hope, and love are espoused as the three cardinal values (Corinthians 13).  In ancient Greek philosophy, wisdom, courage, restraint, and justice, formed the four cardinal virtues.  In Confucianism, the five values were benevolence, justice, courtesy, wisdom, and sincerity, and the the three virtues were wisdom, benevolence, and courage.  In this lecture I will discuss some of the important virtues associated with Japanese budo taking into account Buddhist and Shinto thought.</p><div class='title'><b>Unpacking the abstract, and defining terms</b></div><p>First, a virtue or <i>toku</i> <span class='ja'>徳</span> is a positive personality trait.  It's something that contributes to the dignity of one's life.  <i>Gentoku</i> <span class='ja'>元徳</span> is a fundamental virtue of importance, or <b>cardinal virtue</b>.  These are the basic building blocks of what makes a desirable personality.  As mentioned above in the abstract, wisdom, benevolence, courage as examples of cardinal virtues.</p><p><i>Budo</i> <span class='ja'>武道</span> is field of martial arts, but it doesn't cover all martial arts.  According to The Budo Charter, budo are Japanese martial ways that have been transformed and evolved from combat techniques (<i>jutsu</i>) into ways of self-development (<i>dou</i>).  There are only nine such martial arts: judo <span class='ja'>柔道</span>, kendo <span class='ja'>剣道</span>, kyudo (archery) <span class='ja'>弓道</span>, sumo <span class='ja'>相撲</span>, karatedo <span class='ja'>空手道</span>, aikido <span class='ja'>合気道</span>, shorinji kempo <span class='ja'>少林寺拳法</span>, naginata <span class='ja'>なぎなた</span>, and jukendo <span class='ja'>銃剣道</span>.  </p><p>As mentioned in the abstract, most of these martial arts carry the kanji suffix <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>, which identifies them as a path to self-improvement.  Many other arts in Japan also carry this suffix, such as tea ceremony or <i>sado</i> <span class='ja'>茶道</span>, calligraphy or <i>shodo</i> <span class='ja'>書道</span>, and flower arrangement, or <i>kado</i> <span class='ja'>華道</span>/<span class='ja'>花道</span>.  I don't really understand why iaido <span class='ja'>居合道</span> isn't a budo art, but I guess that's because it's not meant as a means for combat?  Or perhaps it doesn't stem from a former form of combat?</p><p>Despite being different forms of combat, training, and practice, budo martial arts are all connected by the same virtues of self-development and self-improvement.  If a martial art does not follow these virtues, and doesn't set one on the path to self-improvement, it is not considered <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>.  In that case, they are pure fighting techniques, or <i>jutsu</i> <span class='ja'>術</span>.  The virtues of those martial arts and sports are different.</p><p>Because all forms of <i>dou</i> carry the same virtues and basic fundamentals, scholars consider this the reason why so many military commanders and famous swordsman of the past were also great poets, musicians, and writers.  They had some deep connections with themselves and could easily express it.</p><p>This is also why many budo practitioners these days have ranks in multiple branches of budo or other Japanese arts, rather than only one course of study.</p><div class='title'><b>3 important Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>After reading that description and beginning the lecture, I really wanted a straight list of virtues.  I wanted something like, "The cardinal virtues of Japan are…"  But that's not how it went.  Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned that there would not be enough time to mention all the virtues of Japan, and explain why they were so revered.</p><p>Looking through my notes of the lecture, and from what I remember, he focused on 3 particular virtues he found as important.</p><p>- <span class='ja'>礼</span> <i>rei</i> - respect and gratitude<br/>- <span class='ja'>文武両道</span> <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> - the balance between strength and wisdom<br/>- <span class='ja'>無</span> <i>mu</i> - nothingness</p><div class='title'><b>Rei <span class='ja'>礼</span></b></div><p>Physically, <i>rei</i> is the act of bowing.  It's an expression of the importance of order, and an outward expression of our inner <b>respect</b>.  It's a sign that we should love and respect other people, rather than hate.  All human relations are founded on the two principles of <i>shinrai</i>, people trusting and being friendly to each other, and <i>sonkei</i>, acknowledging and respecting those different from you.  And physically bowing to someone is an expression of both.</p><p>As an example, it is respectful for hosts to please their guests.  It's their duty to go above and beyond the capabilities of their guest and impress them.  And it's respectful for guests to acknowledge and show gratitude for everything the host has done for them.  Even if they disappoint, it is always the guest's duty to return the same magnitude of respect to the host.  In that same vain, bowing is also a show of <b>gratitude</b> and thanks.</p><p>In his lecture, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> brought to the topic to respect on the battlefield, or <i>gunjin no rei</i> <span class='ja'>軍陣の礼</span>.  Though, battlefields and war refer more to the fighting done in the warring states period of Japan, not necessarily modern warfare.  Before a battle or fight, bowing to your opponents shows mutual respect for each other as warriors.  Bowing at the end, signifies a return to the state outside on conflict.  It was a way to preserve our humanity even in the face of conflict, and separates us from animals.</p><p>Without bowing on the battlefield, we're nothing but blood-thirsty war-mongering people.  Winning a battle or war at all costs, and dehumanizing and humiliating the enemy is a sign of cowardice and disrespect.  These kind of people are not human, and should be dealt with like animals.</p><div class='title'><b>The Balance between Strength and Wisdom</b></div><p>There's a Japanese term called <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> <span class='ja'>文武両道</span>.  As long time ago, it meant being accomplished in both literary and military arts, or, that all military training should be correctly balanced with scholarship.</p><p>Today, the meaning has changed a little.  Now the translation means having both <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>.  It basically means the same thing, but the military and fighting connotation has been removed.  This change was influenced by western thought thanks to terms like "the pen is mightier than the sword."</p><p>The forces of strength and wisdom are often depicted with red and blue colors.  In popular culture, these colors often depict characters that represent strength or wisdom, such as the power rangers.  If you remember the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the red ranger was the leader of the group, and always the strongest.  He is usually not smart, but feels passion and emotion which often leads him into combat.  The blue ranger, while not necessarily the weakest of the rangers, was certainly the smartest.</p><p>But, strength doesn't mean to simply have physical strength.  Strength also refers to their strength of ones heart and will.  It's the ability to love and compassion.  Without this kind of strength, a person is just blood thirsty.  True warriors fight with compassion.</p><p>You can see this ALL the time in Shonen Jump series such as Dragonball and One Piece.  Goku and Luffy often lack the wisdom side of the coin, but their strength always comes their compassion for their friends, or what is just or right.  They never enter into a fight for no reason.</p><div class='title'><b>Nothingness <span class='ja'>無</span></b></div><p>The goal for any budo practitioner is to be able to perform moves and actions naturally and without thinking.  This is known as a state of <i>jizai</i> <span class='ja'>自在</span>, or naturality.  How is this done?  One way is to achieve this state of nothingness.</p><p>By nothingness I mean that the practitioner wishes to have a simple state of being.  This can be done through the unification of the following 3 states of consciousness:  <b>sincerity</b>, <b>selflessness</b>, and being able to <b>free the mind of thoughts</b>.</p><p>Following these states, the practitioner is able to free themselves of themselves.  Their own ego, wants, and desires are no longer in their way, and everything becomes instinct, and natural.</p><p>True masters and experts strive for this ideal state of character, and can achieve these states at will.</p><p>This aligns with true virtues:  the virtue of <b>honesty</b> or <i>shoujiki</i> <span class='ja'>正直</span>, and the virtue of <b>purity of spirit</b>, or <i>seijou</i> <span class='ja'>清浄</span>.  The lecturer make a point by saying, "I believe these are the most important of the virtues."</p><div class='title'><b>The Book of Japanese Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>Not quite being satisfied from my notes of the lecture, I wanted to know all of the cardinal virtues of Japan.  I wanted the finish this sentence: "The cardinal virtues of Japan are …"  Fortunately, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> literally wrote the book on the subject.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lecture was actually just a small snippet of what he wrote about.  Though, the book isn't just an answer to "What are the Cardinal Virtues of Japan?"  It's a published account of all personality traits found good and desirable in Japan in different circumstances and situations, how they've been developed, and how they relate to budo culture in most cases.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I can't actually read it.  But, I can translate the table of contents and form a decent list of what's inside.  The contents are split into 4 sections: order and harmony, world citizenship, self-development, and objects of self-improvement.</p><div class='title'><b>Order <i>chitsujo</i> <span class='ja'>秩序</span> and Harmony <i>wagou</i> <span class='ja'>和合</span></b></div><p>These virtues mostly deal with the inner expression of yourself.  These are your thoughts and feelings about the world around you, and how you conduct your life.  Some of these are also outward expressions that demonstrate or convey your inner thoughts and ideals.</p><p><span class='ja'>側隠の心</span> <i>sokuin no kokoro</i><br/><b>Compassion of the Heart</b> or "showing sympathy or pity."  Apparently <i>sokuin</i> has more of a negative connotation, so I think "pity" is better.  But, that doesn't really make sense.  Wouldn't the ideal be showing compassion and sympathy for others by not looking down on them?  Being one with them, and looking past any ego driven or vain thoughts about yourself?</p><p><span class='ja'>敬</span> - <span class='ja'>「うやまう」「つつしむ」</span> <i>kei</i> - <i>uyamau tsutsushimu</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b>.  Being able to show respect <i>uyamau</i> to other people, and being modest <i>tsutsushimu</i> about your own achievements.  This is the same kanji used in <i>keigo</i> <span class='ja'>敬語</span>, which is the honorific / respectful words and language used in Japanese.</p><p><span class='ja'>清浄</span> <i>seijou</i> <br/> <b>Purity</b> - pure of heart / innocence (like a baby)</p><p><span class='ja'>礼</span> - <span class='ja'>天地の序</span> <i>rei</i> - <i>techi no ji</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b> and <b>Gratitude</b>.  This was already mentioned above, but it's the idea of performing things in a set order.  The act of bowing preludes heaven and earth.</p><p><span class='ja'>倹約</span> - <span class='ja'>均衡</span> - <span class='ja'>調和の知恵</span> <i>kenyaku</i> - <i>kinkou</i> - <i>chouwa no chie</i> <br/> <b>Frugality - Balance - Harmony of Wisdom</b>.  This is the idea that simplicity is best.  You should rid yourself of unnecessary things in your daily life, and only live with what is needed.  You must manage overindulgence.</p><div class='title'><b>World Citizenship <span class='ja'>世の中の一員</span></b></div><p>These virtues are about yourself outward expression to the world.  This is how someone should conduct themselves as a member of their community, society, and the world.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> - <span class='ja'>百行の本</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>hyakkou no moto</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> - the foundation of all actions.  Filial Piety means your undying loyalty to your parents and family, and essentially having the capacity to support them as they have supported you.  Apparently, this is foundations of all of our actions in our lives.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> (<span class='ja'>続</span>) - <span class='ja'>親子の真実</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>oyako no shinjitsu</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> (continued) - the nature of the relationship between parent and child.</p><p><span class='ja'>勤勉</span> - <span class='ja'>世のため人のための徳</span> <i>kinben</i> - <i>yo no tame hito no tame no toku</i> <br/> <b>Diligence</b>.  This is the virtue of people who do things for the greater good of the world.  Those that work hard everyday at what they do.</p><p><span class='ja'>義</span> - <span class='ja'>人間の条件</span> <i>gi</i> - <i>ningen no jouken</i> <br/> <b>Morality</b> or <b>Justice</b> - the human condition.  Members of yakuza gangs use the term <i>gi</i> to describe the rules they enforce in the public and among themselves.</p><p><span class='ja'>信義</span> - <span class='ja'>公共の精神</span> <i>shingi</i> - <i>koukyou no seishin</i> <br/> <b>Trust</b> / <b>Faith</b> / <b>Loyalty</b> - the spirit of common sense.  This means having faith in society that they'll do the right things, and by being a member of society that you uphold that faith of common sense.</p><p><span class='ja'>分別</span> - <span class='ja'>大人の道徳</span> <i>bunbetsu</i> - <i>otona no doutoku</i> <br/> <b>Judgement</b> (or <b>Discrimination</b>) - the morals and ethics of adults.</p><div class='title'><b>Self-development <span class='ja'>自己を育てる</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>誠</span> - <span class='ja'>修行の思想</span> <i>makoto</i> - <i>shugyou no shisou</i> <br/><b>Honesty</b> or <b>Integrity</b> - the ideals of <i>shugyou</i> training.  Translating <i>shugyou</i> only as 'training' loses a lot of its meaning.  <i>Shugyou</i> training is strict self-disciplined mental and physical training like a samurai.  Examples would be doing the same disciplined training everyday exactly the same to achieve perfection.  Or, there's the example of a samurai sitting and meditating under a waterfall.  The purpose is to try and attain a state of zen or a state of <i>mu</i>.  It's these ideals that establish integrity.</p><p><span class='ja'>忠</span> - <span class='ja'>普遍的価値への奉仕</span> <i>chuu</i> - <i>fuhen-teki-kachi e no houshi</i> <br/><b>Loyalty</b> - devoting oneself to the universal values of loyalty.</p><p><span class='ja'>和</span> - <span class='ja'>『憲法十七条』の精神</span> <i>wa</i> - <i>[kenpou 17 jou] no seshin</i><br/> <b>Harmony</b> - the spirit of the Seventeen-article constitution.  The Seventeen-article constitution is a document written by Prince Shoutoku Taishi in 604.  It was a highly Buddhist and Confucian inspired set of morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects.  An excerpt from Wikipedia states, "Harmony is to be valued, and the avoidance of wanton opposition to be honored."</p><p><span class='ja'>克己</span> - <span class='ja'>忍耐</span> - <span class='ja'>現代に最もっとも必要な徳</span> <i>kokki</i> - <i>nintai</i> - <i>gendai ni sai motto mo hitsuyou na toku</i> <br/><b>Self-Control</b> - <b>Patience</b> - the most necessary trait in our modern age.</p><p><span class='ja'>定心</span> - <span class='ja'>存心</span> - <span class='ja'>正念</span> - <span class='ja'>正気に返れ</span> <i>joushin</i> - <i>zonshin</i> - <i>shounen</i> - <i>shouki ni kaere</i><br/><b>Meditation</b>, <b>Feelings from the heart</b>, and <b>True Faith</b>.  Meditation is the spirit of Buddhism.  You rid yourself of all distractions and focus your mind on a single thought.  You keep yourself in a free state, void of feeling, or a level feelings.  It's like a state of nothingness.  You try to achieve a state of zen.  True Faith is being able to control or correct your bad feelings, and bring in good feelings.</p><p><span class='ja'>怨望</span> - <span class='ja'>日本人の弱点</span> <i>enpou</i> - <i>nihonjin no jakuten</i><br/> <b>Envy</b> - a Japanese weakness.  The first kanji is also used for the verb <i>uramu</i> <span class='ja'>怨む</span>, which means to have a grudge against someone.  But, this boils down to resentment, jealousy.  There's a really common utterance in Japanese: <span class='ja'>いいな</span>.  Directly, it's translates as "that's good," or "that's awesome," but it carries a sense of wanting with it, like, "I want that to," or "I wish I had that, too."  I'm not sure if including this virtue is an example of something bad, or if it's just part of being Japanese, good or bad.</p><p><span class='ja'>勇</span> - <span class='ja'>肉体に根ざす徳</span> <i>yuu</i> - <i>nikutai ni nezasu toku</i><br/> <b>Bravery</b> or <b>Courage</b> - the fundamental trait that makes up the human body.</p><p><span class='ja'>仁</span> - <span class='ja'>生命のものの徳</span> <i>jin</i> - <i>seimei no mono mo toku</i><br/> <b>Benevolence</b> or consideration and compassion for other people.  Humanity.  This is the virtue of all existence and life in general.</p><p><span class='ja'>志</span> - <span class='ja'>人生の司令塔</span> <i>kokorozashi</i> - <i>jinsei no shireitou</i><br/> <b>Intention</b> or <b>Motive</b> - the central drive or direction that controls our lives, or your reason for doing the things you do.</p><p><span class='ja'>『教育勅語』の徳目</span> <i>[kyouiku chokugo] no tokume</i><br/><b>Types of virtues taken from the "Imperial Rescript of Education"</b>.  The Imperial Rescript was kind of like the Pledge of a Allegiance in the US.  It was something that all school children (prior to World War II) would read and say in school.  It requested that people advance public good and promote common interests, always respect the constitution and observe the laws, and should emergency arise, offer yourself to defend and maintain the prosperity of the Imperial Throne.  These days, Japanese people consider this nationalist train of thought dangerous as it lead to the mistakes of war.</p><div class='title'><b>The Objective of Self-improvement <span class='ja'>修養の目標</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>男一匹</span> - <span class='ja'>新渡戸稲造の修養論</span> <i>otoko ippiki</i> - <i>Nitobe Inazou no shouyou ron</i><br/><b>The perfection of masculinity</b> - Nitobe Inazou's idea of self-improvement.  This is the ideal that every Japanese man wants to be.</p><p><span class='ja'>すてきなひと</span> - <span class='ja'>女性らしさの徳</span> <i>suteki na hito</i> - <i>josei rashisa no toku</i><br/><b>"Beautiful" Person</b> - feminine virtues.</p><p><span class='ja'>三種の神器</span> - <span class='ja'>政治家の徳</span> <i>sanshu no jingo</i> - <i>seijika no toku</i><br/><b>Three Sacred Treasures</b> - the virtues required of politicians.  These are honesty <span class='ja'>正直</span> <i>shoujiki</i>, compassion <span class='ja'>慈悲</span> <i>jihi</i>, and wisdom <span class='ja'>知恵</span> <i>chie</i>.</p><p><span class='ja'>老木の花</span> - <span class='ja'>亀の甲より年の功</span> <i>rouboku no hana</i> - <i>kame no koi yori toshi no koi</i><br/>(<b>Idioms</b>) The Flower of an Old Tree - wise old man wisdom from a turtle shell.  These are virtues found from idioms, or wise old sayings passed down by generations.  Heeding this wisdom shows respect to the elderly.</p><p><span class='ja'>無私</span> - <span class='ja'>徳の大きさ</span> <i>mushi</i> - <i>toku no okisa</i><br/><b>Nothingness</b> - the size of a virtue.</p><p><span class='ja'>中庸</span> -<span class='ja'>「普通」</span>- <span class='ja'>こそが究極の徳</span> <i>chuuyou</i> - <i>[futsuu]</i> - <i>koso ga kyuukyoku no toku</i><br/><b>The Golden Mean</b> - <b>Normality</b> or being average - virtues of the ultimate goal.  This is about sticking to the group, and not being extreme.  But, it can also mean being fair, and not taking sides.  Ultimately, this idea came from China.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>The book is quite dense.  It'd be like a Japanese person trying to translate a bible into their language.  Some of these virtues deal with the roots of modern day Japanese culture stemming from China.  Others are wholly formed Japanese ideals.  One easy way to identify traits stemming directly from Japanese ideals are the words that use a single kanji.  Usually words with two or three kanji stem directly from Chinese kanji.</p><div class='title'><b>Balance</b></div><p>Out of everything, I found the topic of balancing strength and wisdom particularly important to me.  Not being able to fully understand Japanese (and perhaps the way they train junior high students) has made me miss a lot of the theory and thought process behind the moves and training I've done thus far.  Even the written test makes the test-takers only memorize the words written, but not actually think of their own answers.</p><p>The lecture on the following day mentioned that one cannot learn a budo art by training alone.  Someone who only trains technique and only builds physical strength and speed will never be on the same level as someone who balances training both their body and mind.</p><p>This conference was immensely valuable to me because of this.  It identified my largest weakness in learning kendo so far.  The idea of always training in kendo doesn't necessarily make you better at kendo.  Improving aspects of your life, and bringing balance to everything will improve your skills as well.</p><p>Good habits in your life are brought into your budo, just as the bad habits, too.  If you're a well-organized person, those ideals are brought into your performance.  If you're a slouch or a sloppy person, those ideals are also brought in, too.  Kendo and other budo arts are an expression of your inner self, and your moves and techniques mirror those ideals.  This is what your opponent sees when faced against you.  </p><p>And things I improve in kendo translate back in my life.  Kendo is no longer just something that I do.  Kendo is who am I.  It's a part of me.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Firewatch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/firewatch">Firewatch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's about a man wanting to distance himself from his life, taking a job as a forest lookout in the deep forests of Wyoming.  It takes place in 1989, one year after the great fire disaster of yellowstone park.  As this man, you live in the isolated wilderness, and try to find peace.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" /></a></p><p>Your only human contact throughout the game is your immediate supervisor, Delilah.  You are in constant communication with her over your two-way radio.  You're only introduction and interaction with her is talking.  She'll ask questions about your life.  You'll answer.  You'll make jokes.  Or you'll avoid answers.</p><p>It's like laying in bed late at night, talking with someone on the phone.  Your conversation is so close, and so personal.  But you're separated by a vast distance.  Because of this, Firewatch is probably the most human game I've ever played.</p><p>The only image you have of her, is her own lookout tower on the horizon, in the distance.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the game, or the experience, that Firewatch tells.  Depending on how you open up to Delilah, or keep bottled up, determines the tone of the conversation through the game.

The music sets an atmosphere of tranquility and peace.  All of the main character's problems are back in the busy life of society.  All that responsibility can stay there, away from him.</p><p>On the surface, I think the game speaks to all of our back-seated desires to simply give up all of our responsibilities, and be free.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" /></a></p><p>Underneath the surface, the game begins to peel away those layers of freedom by praying on your idea of safety.

| February 3, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I came across some interesting Hida history today when talking with my school's librarian.  This year is the 140th anniversary of the formation of Gifu-ken, which happened in August 1876 or Meiji <span class='ja'>明治</span>９<span class='ja'>年</span> as part of the Meiji restoration.</p><p>Prior to the Meiji restoration, Japan was a collection of hundreds of kingdoms.  At that time, Hida was its own kingdom <span class='ja'>飛騨国</span>.  In 1868 (Keioi <span class='ja'>慶応</span>４<span class='ja'>年</span>), the Hida Kingdom was renamed to Hida-ken <span class='ja'>飛騨県</span>.  Though, it didn't last long.  It was Hida-ken in May, and then 1 month later it was renamed to Takayama-ken <span class='ja'>高山県</span>.  From 1868 to 1871 (<span class='ja'>明治</span>４<span class='ja'>年</span>), Takayama was its own prefecture! :D  </p><p>Only 3 years, though.  In 1871, it was absorbed by nearby Nagano territories to form Chikuma-ken <span class='ja'>筑摩県</span>.  Chikuma-ken was basically a gigantic, bloated Nagano.  In August 1876, Hida (and Nakatsugawa) broke away from Chikuma-ken, and joined together with the rest of Mino <span class='ja'>美濃</span> to create what we know of today as Gifu-ken <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>.</p><p>And then in 1880, the first official map of Gifu-ken was published.  Apparently that map is still available to see today in the Gifu Prefectural Library.</p><p><br/>Anyway, I thought that was interesting.  Also, it's really weird to think that despite of all the ancient history in Japan, Wisconsin (1848) is actually older than Gifu-ken (1876), on paper anyways.</p><p><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%9C%8C" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%9C%8C">https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%9C%8C</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Witness" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-witness">The Witness</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He’s been working on this game for the better part of a decade after the release of his debut title, Braid.</p><p>In The Witness, you explore an island held together by various kinds of line/circle puzzles.  The island has a variety of environments with their own versions of these puzzles.  Areas in the general world combine these different rules into more complex versions of puzzles you already know.  </p><p>Progression in the game is the transformation of yourself.  The game never explicitly teaches you how to do these puzzles.  Everything is learned by doing.  You are trained through a system of progressively difficult puzzles with each new rule set.  The world is open, as well, so you can begin anywhere you’d like and tackle any puzzle at any time.  But, if you haven’t experienced the rules for yourself, you might not know what to look for, or how to figure it out.</p><p>It’s an amazing journey.  It’s very satisfying to figure out how to solve puzzles, especially ones you’ve seen at the beginning and had no idea what to do at that time.</p><p>Though, it’s hard not to feel like a tourist when exploring the idea.  You are only able to interact with puzzles, and there are no people.  No living people, anyway.  There are some statues of people that can be interpreted as some kind of story, or hint.  There are voice recordings and some videos, too, but say nothing directly.  They are all quote and clips of renowned scientists talking about how we perceive ourselves and the world around us.</p><p>In the end, I think island is just an allegory.  The idea of a person just writing puzzles.  A person losing himself to art of writing the same puzzle over and over again.  And by writing these puzzles he encapsulates and isolates himself from the world, whether it be by accident or on purpose.  The act of solving all these puzzles isn’t to set him free, but to understand the corner he’s written himself in.</p><p>In that way, too, the idea of being a tourist still works.  You are basically just exploring the mind of a puzzle writer.</p><p>I guess the only revelation found through the game, it’s "braid-like" moment, (spoilers) would be naturally discovering that the accumulation of the puzzles have transformed the environment into a puzzle itself.  And once you begin noticing the line/circle puzzle in the environment, you begin looking everywhere for the hints of a circle so that it might complete another unseen puzzle.</p><p>In a way, the game transforms you again.  Well, it changed me anyway.  Becoming obsessed with these puzzles in the game bleeds into the real life.  Now, I see circles and lines everywhere and moving into a position where I could complete the puzzle.</p><p>The Witness is an amazing and unique experience.  Beautiful, mysterious, and brilliant.  It is definitely worth your time to play it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Micro-aggressions in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/micro-aggressions-in-japan">Micro-aggressions in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 28, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year, at our second Skills Development Conference, I gave a quick speech about micro-aggressions.  I quickly talked about what they are, what's the problem, and how I deal with them.  I tried to give the topic justice as 2 years prior another ALT gave a similar talk about it, too, and I found it really helpful when dealing with some of the problems of daily life in Japan.</p><p>This was part of a session of "micro-panels" which is consisted of 4 shorter talks about various subjects.  Subjects not necessarily long enough or useful enough to take over their own 50 minute panel.  I budgeted this talk at 10-12 minutes.</p><p>I had some help with this presentation, too.  Fellow ALT and RPA Cathy Anatra volunteered for this subject, too.  Though, I pretty much took over the whole thing, and talked about the things I wanted to talk about.  She helped me QA the speech, and gave me some direction and pointers if I was missing anything.  She also gave some of her own personal experiences during that part of the talk.</p><p>But!  Here's what I wrote.  This is my intended transcript for my talk.  I also included most slides from my powerpoint, and the time-stamps from when I timed myself speaking.</p><div class='title'><b>Micro-aggressions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" /></p><p>The term "micro-aggressions" carries some baggage with it for those who have heard it before.  This is the definition I use:  A micro aggression is an everyday slight, indignity, or invalidation unintentionally made towards a marginalized group by a well-intentioned person of the majority.  In the case of Japan, the marginalized group would be us.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" /></p><p>These actions may seem small, and not even a problem, but day after day, they add up into something greater.  They not only make us feel different, but they point out how different we are to the society we are living in.  They point out that we don't fit in, and possibly that we won't fit in.  We're not the same, and we're outside of their circle.</p><p>I'm not talking about directly racist or insulting things, though.  I should really underline the terms "unintentionally" and "well-intentioned" in my definition because these are the comments I wish to focus on.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" /></p><p>I think the top 3 comments I've gotten over the years have been, "<span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>！", "<span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>？", and "<span class='ja'>何とか休みは帰りますか</span>？".  (or) "You're Japanese is so good!", "Can you eat natto?", and "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?"  Or even..  "where will you travel?"</p><p>We've all heard these haven't we?  <span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>?  Really?  I've said 2 poorly constructed sentences, and my Japanese is good?  <span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>?  Yes, I can eat natto.  Do you think it's poisonous to me, or something?  Am I too inferior to eat it?  <span class='ja'>帰りますか</span>?  Will I return?  Are you asking because I need to go back to "my people."  Because I don't belong here?  Because I'm an outsider?</p><p>Here are some more examples:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" /></p><p>These are the kind of micro-aggressions we all get a daily basis.  The first couple of times, it's no big deal, really.  But after months and years, they get tiring and their indirect messages become the real conversation. <br> [2.5 minutes]</p><p>Going back to my definition, this is not intentional.  The person talking to you is unaware of the underlying message being communicated.  They don't "mean" to make us feel alienated, or unwanted with these comments.  And this is why it's difficult to confront the "aggressor" about it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" /></p><p>If you confront the other person, and respond to their comments or questions in the same vain as I had just now, you can guarantee they won't make the mistake of talking to you again.  You've basically alienated yourself.  If you want to go more extreme with this example, perhaps you've now made this person think all westerners are confrontational about the smallest of comments or questions.</p><p>However, if you go the other way, by ignoring or shrugging off the comments, you're letting the problem persist.  And you've allowed yourself to soak up more of these comments.  They build and build, and eventually you revile and hate Japan.  If you want to go extreme again, perhaps you'll become a steaming pile of hate whom can never smile, and then no one will talk to you.  You've eventually leave Japan, and tell everyone how terrible a country it is.</p><p>In both instances, you've alienated yourself, and even created or perpetuated stereotypes.</p><p>So..  what's the solution?  You are.  We are.  I think we are the solution.  <br>[1.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" /></p><p>For me, I hadn't heard of this term before coming to Japan.  I first learned about it at our SDC two years ago.  I was at a point where after making friends with some teachers and parents, they made a couple of comments that pushed me back, and made me feel distant.  They made me feel like I didn't belong and wouldn't ever belong.</p><p>One of the things that turned me around was learning that this word even existed.  It gave me comfort, and it gave me strength.  This is the reason why I wanted to give this talk, and inform everyone about this word.  Knowing about this word allowed me contextualize the comments that were being made, rather than see them as direct assaults against me.  And through that I was able to deal with them appropriately.</p><p>As an example, at an enkai, one of my teachers kept talking to me in a baby voice.  I think we were talking about hiking and mountain climbing, and she kept responding very deliberately and emphatically.  It really felt like she was talking down to me.  <span class='ja'>そうですね。すごいですね。</span>Patronizing.  <span class='ja'>何とか山をのびますか。</span>As if she had to speak this way in order for me to understand.  </p><p>Even though it annoyed me, I just ignored it, and continued with the conversation.  A few minutes later, she began talking with another teacher, and she had the exact same tone.  And she continued that way throughout the rest of the night.  So it wasn't that she was talking down to me, or anything.  That's just the way she talks. <br>[2 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, my solution is not to confront, nor ignore, but to respond in a way that creates a conversation.  I think that's one of the most important responsibilities for us in Japan.  We should live up to our titles as unofficial cultural ambassadors.  We shouldn't directly confront their stereotypes about us, but we should bring them up from time and time, talk about them, and inform the other person about you as a person, rather than you as a race.</p><p>Going back to the natto conversation, I just respond with the truth.  Eh… it's okay.  Nothing special.  Do you like natto?  How often do you eat natto?  What food do you like or hate?  I try to pull them into the conversation, rather than it being one-sided.</p><p>Going back to the questions, "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?" or "..will you travel?"  I really see this more as an icebreaker for small talk.  While you could take it as them thinking your life in Japan is just a temporary home, I think a lot of them want to live vicariously through you.  They would love to have your "freedom" to travel around Japan, or the world.  They want to know more about these places, and how it related to their own lives.  And they want to know more about your home country, too.</p><p>This was even true at my previous job back in the US.  One of my co-workers' spouses said that she loved reading my blog, and looking through all the pictures I posted online from visiting Japan.  She liked to live vicariously through me because they don't really travel outside of the country that much.</p><p>Both these questions aren't assaults against you because you're different.  A lot of the time, many of those examples from earlier are just icebreakers.  Other people want to talk to you, and get your opinions on things that may be different for you.  It turns into an opportunity for you to inform and educate others about those differences.  It's usually a great topic of conversation.</p><p>Going back to the baby speech, sometimes if they talk to you like a baby, it could be that they just aren't aware of the amount of Japanese you understand, or perhaps they just don't know how to properly communicate with a foreigner.  Talking with them more often, and finding shared interests will give them more exposure to yourself, and to foreigners in general.  And make them more comfortable talking to us.</p><p>Overall, I would say to put yourselves in their shoes.  Think about where they're coming from when making some of these comments.  <br>[3.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" /></p><p>Lastly, I think it's important to understand that we can be just as guilty as making micro-aggressive comments or actions as they are.  It's important for us as we attempt to defuse micro-aggressions directed towards us, that we in-turn, identify and defuse any that we make ourselves.</p><p>I think the two most common ones for me are finding legitimate ways of complimenting or correcting other people's language, and finding ways of talking to Japanese people in English that doesn't sound like Tarzan-speech, or baby speech.</p><p>After receiving so many ill-gotten compliments on my Japanese, I never compliment anyone on how well they speak English because I'm too afraid of sounding like they do to me.  Though, I have a few teachers that have gotten A LOT better at English since I first met them that probably deserve some kind of compliment or reassurance because of how hard they've tried to get better.  I would say that if you were to compliment someone on their English, don't make a single one-off compliment.  Tell them why you think it's good, and why you felt you had to compliment them.  By giving them the reasons for the comments, it becomes sincere and worthwhile.</p><p>As far as talking like a baby, or talking like Tarzan, I think it's very important for us to speak as grammatically and emphatically correct as possible when using English around Japanese people.  Adults can definitely tell when they're being talked down to.  But for our students, we are the "perfect" model for them to learn correct English.  They listen to us way more than you might realize.  They have a keen ear for inflection, emphasis, and intonation.  If you're "dumbing down" your speech to be more understandable, some of those traits could be accidentally taught to them.</p><p>I have an example of this.  Sometimes when talking slow, I add unnecessary emphasis on some of my words.  Especially, the word "and."  One of my students did the speech contest last year.  I helped him write the English for his speech, and I recorded myself reading his speech, so he could practice it over and over again at home.  I used "and" as a conjunction between two sentences, like so, "So, I think one reason manga is so popular is the choice for readers.  And, I think it's fun to cosplay characters that appear in manga."</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" /></p><p>When speaking at normal speed, the "and" works as intended.  It's a soft conjunction joining the two sentences.  But, when I slow down, the "and" becomes much more pronounced.  It no longer sounds natural or correct if spoken at normal speed.</p><p>From that point on, whenever we read something in class that uses "and" as a conjunction, this student always has that extra unnecessary inflection.  Weirdly enough, my JTE has started doing it, too.</p><p>Again, this example isn't really a micro-aggression in of itself, but an example that your "model" of English, if thought correct, will be imitated.  Please keep it in mind.  <br>[4.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" /></p><p>Anyway, that's my speech, and that's my advice to you.  Thank you. :D</p><div class='title'><b>Finished</b></div><p>I don't think my talk had the same impact of when I first heard about micro-aggressions, but hopefully it inspired some of the audience members to think about things.</p><p>As mentioned before, this was part of a collection of micro-panels at our Skills Development Conference in January.  I was the MC for the entire panel, too, so I wrote an additional 3 minute speech to fill time at the end, if needed.</p><p>Later this year, I'll give this speech at our farewell enkai for those ALTs leaving the program.  It combines two things I've come across talking about foreigners or "outsiders" fitting into Japan.</p><p>Enjoy! :D</p><div class='title'><b>Fitting in Japan</b></div><p>I have another story about living in Japan, or abroad in general.  We are all circle people.  We lived in our circle country, spoke our circle language, and hung out with our circle friends.  We fit in.  Our circle pegs fit perfectly well into the circle holes of our lives.</p><p>But now we're in a triangle country.  Our circle pegs don't fit into the triangle holes.  Being here changes us.  We make many conscious and unconscious decisions on a daily basis that changes our circle shape to more closely resemble a triangle.  We lose some things, and gain some things.  The longer we stay, the more and more we become a triangle.  Though, obviously we can never fully be a triangle, but we can make ourselves fit in.</p><p>As we return to our circle country, we won't fit in at first.  As time goes on, our circle shape will return, but we'll never be as round as we once were.  The story finishes by saying we've become a shape that doesn't necessarily fit into either country.</p><p><br/>One of my students once wrote a speech on what it was like being half Japanese, and half American living in Japan.  Because she felt like she didn't fit in Japanese society, she always considered herself half Japanese.  She finally had the chance to visit the US, and while she physically felt like she fit in, she couldn't speak English well, and didn't really fit in there either.  She felt half American.  </p><p>She told this to her grandfather, and he gave her the following advice.  He was envious of her position.  He never thought of her as half Japanese, or half American, but BOTH Japanese and American.  He never saw her as half-anything.  She is a double.  That really changed the view she had on her own life.</p><p><br/>The experiences that we have in Japan, and the changes that happen to us, stay with us well after we leave.  They ultimately shape us into the people we will become, or into the people that we are.  While perhaps we think we're losing some of ourselves to fit in, we are gaining so much in the process.  And we eventually become part of both societies.<br>[3 minutes]<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Packers v.

| January 4, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For Christmas this year, I received tickets to the Packers / Vikings game along with my brother, sister, and her husband. While I'm not a football fan, I am a fan of live events and trying out new things. I also like hanging out with my family. This was actually a repeat gift from a few years prior with my sister, her husband, and my dad all went to the Packers game.</p><p>I don't remember much about the game, but looking into the past, looks like the Vikings won the game, 20-13. Go Purple! I don't think we really hung out or went to any bars. It was a pretty strict 4-hour trip to Lambeau from Minneapolis, and another 4-hour drive back.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/17">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/15">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
