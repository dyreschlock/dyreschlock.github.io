It's actually not that bad.  In fact, it's probably the easiest Castlevania ever made.</p><p>I bought and played through the US version.  After I finished it, I wanted to try out the Japanese version, so I downloaded that on my Japanese 3DS.  There are some interesting differences.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" /></p><p>First off, when it was originally released in Japan, Castlevania 2 was a Famicom Disk game, rather than a cartridge.  The 3DS game emulates the loading effects of the game, too, so every time to switch areas in the game, it's accompanied by a 3-4 second loading screen.</p><p>Also, the music is absolute trash.  It the same music as the US version, but without several added "instruments" that create the iconic tracks everyone knows from the game.  It's really weird listening to it.  </p><p>The Japanese version sounds and feels so incomplete.  It's so weird that they completely dropped the ball on the translation for the US version.  They clearly spent time fixing the other problems with the game.</p><p>Along with the translation, the ending of the Japanese version is WAY more complete, and actually features credits!  The US version just mentions a few mistranslated things, and ends.</p><p>Here's the full good ending to the Japanese version for comparison:</p><p class='img'><img

| May 6, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I took part in the Nakagawa Half Marathon <span class='ja'>中川ハーフマラソン</span>, located in a beautiful valley of southern Nagano prefecture <span class='ja'>長野県</span>.  I came across this marathon by browsing through <a href="http://runnet.jp/" title="http://runnet.jp/">runnet.jp</a>, Japan's premiere website for signing up for marathons.  (Very similar to active.com in the states.)  Unlike the Takaoka Marathon, which I've "run" twice now (<a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">Nov 18th, 2013</a>, <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2" title="/takaoka-marathon-2">Jun 18th, 2014</a>), this was much more laid back and treated as a community event, rather than an athletic competition.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" /></p><p>They actually had a marathon expo prior to the event where people could do packet pick-up.  I was unable to make it there the day before, so I went the morning of the marathon.  Packet Pick-up was quite smooth.  With each packet, you could enter a raffle to win several local goods.  I won an apple.</p><p>Inside the packet was a bunch of advertisement, and coupons.  Also included is the marathon "program" which includes a list of ALL participants.  The Takaoka Marathon did this, too.  Looking through the list, I was one of only 3 or 4 foreign participants, out of the entire ~3000 person list.  They gave out 2 bibs, too.  The front one contains the timing chip.  The back one shows which prefecture you've come from.</p><div class='title'><b>Opening Ceremony errata</b></div><p>On the day of the race, the expo was open from 7:00am to 8:20am.  At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" /></p><p>This lasted 40 minutes. :/  The speakers didn't take all that long, but the special guests absorbed a ton of time.  Musical guest: Parallel Dream came to cheer us on.  This is an idol group from Nagano.  And M<span class='ja'>高史</span> (Takashi), which is apparently some kind of famous runner, or a comedian, or both? I dunno.</p><p>They entertained the crowd, and then everyone did the morning exercise routine.  I left and wandered around.</p><p>The race finally began at 9:30am.  I really miss the 7:00am start times in America.</p><div class='title'><b>The Course</b></div><p>M<span class='ja'>高史</span> fired the starting pistol, and then started giving everyone high-fives as they ran passed him.  It was SO congested, I don't think I started actually running until 1km in.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" /></p><p>For the first 3.5km, it was completely uphill.  We started at 470m above sea level, and kept climbing and climbing.  At 3.5km, we reached the highest point in the marathon, 620m.</p><p>The view along the way was great.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going downhill is so much easier.  Gravity does most of the work. :)  But, it was still too congested to actually glide down the hill.  And now we were running against the people behind us still climbing the hill.</p><p>Just past the 4km mark, the last person went by, and road width essentially doubled.  I launched myself into the other lane, and somewhat leapt down the hill.  Stride, stride, stride.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We continued down through a neighborhood and past several bridges.  The roads weren't completely shut down, so some cars would drive by, and try to make it through the packs of people.</p><p>Around the 8km, the "bottom" of the course became visible.  The lowest point of 420m, which were flat farm plots.  You were able to see almost everyone in front of you, and the direction of the course.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When running marathons, I really prefer to think about the course one mile, or one kilometer at a time.  I like knowing which mile or kilometer I'm running, but being able to see the entire course is just too much to take in.  "I need to run all of that?!"  And there are so many people in front of me.  Bleh…</p><p>On top of that, the course zig-zags around the rice fields, rather than going in a straight line.  It's somewhat demoralizing when a course doesn't take the most efficient route.  It feels like I'm wasting time, rather than getting to the finish as fast as I can.</p><p>It's quite beautiful, though. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last leg of the course was an uphill climb to the finish line.  At this point, it was nice to look back and see the course, and remind myself just how far I've traveled.  Seeing the course here is way more rewarding rather than seeing it near the middle of the run.</p><p>Only a short kilometer or two remaining, until crossing the finish line.  After crossing the finish line, they drape you in a large tower with the marathon's logo on it.  Really nice.  My time was 2 hours 40 minutes 13 seconds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not bad. :)  I did a bit better than I thought I would.  Continuing back to the expo hall, you could take some bottled water, fruit, and other post-race food.  Like an actual marathon back in the states!</p><p>Overall, I really liked this race.  It went through some beautiful scenery, and with the 3 hour limit, there were many more casual racers, rather than a legion of athletes.  The race was nice and casual, and was very fun.  This race was the most like any marathon I've done back in the states.  Very positive, and fun.</p><p>I'll definitely do this again next time.</p><p><u>Update (June 25th):</u>  Man.. I have been 100% sick since doing this race.  I've been coughing every day, and my lungs are constantly full of flem.  Ech.  I most've inhaled pollen or dust or something airborne during this race that has ruined my lungs. :(<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Tanake 高根村" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane">Revisiting Tanake 高根村</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

During winter, there was so much snow that the roads became difficult and dangerous to drive. However, over time, people who grew up in these neighborhoods moved closer to Takayama proper for jobs.

Unfortunately, it was missing one important thing that I really love about modern cars:  a direct AUX input for the car stereo.  Using this, I could connect my phone to the car stereo and play music, rather than having to worry about CDs, or the radio.</p><p>I looked around online for ways to accomplish this in my situation.  I don't remember the exact path of links, and research, but I eventually came across this <a href="http://www.danbp.org/w/Installing_an_USB/SD/MP3/Aux-in_adapter_on_the_Suzuki_Jimny_OEM_Radio" title="http://www.danbp.org/w/Installing_an_USB/SD/MP3/Aux-in_adapter_on_the_Suzuki_Jimny_OEM_Radio">article</a> on a blog by Daniel Brooke Peig.

| March 28, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, it was way too nice outside to not go outside and take some photos.  I was super hungover from drinking with teachers and parents the previous night, but it was too perfect a day to waste sleeping.  A perfect day such as this requires a trip to the Shinhotaka Ropeway.  On such a nice day, you can see everything the view has to offer.</p><p>Shinhotaka <span class='ja'>新穂高</span> refers to the base area in Takayama underneath a collection of mountains known as Mount Hotaka <span class='ja'>穂高岳</span>.  These mountains rest in northeastern Takayama bordering Nagano prefecture, and are some of the tallest mountains not only in Gifu, but all of Japan.  The major peaks of Hotaka are Okuhotaka <span class='ja'>奥穂高</span>, Karasawa <span class='ja'>涸沢</span>, Kitahotaka <span class='ja'>北穂高</span>, Maehotaka <span class='ja'>前穂高</span>, and Nishihotaka <span class='ja'>西穂高</span>.  <a href="/old/v7/norikura-snow" title="/norikura-snow">Mount Norikura</a> <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> is not part of the range, by the way.  That is a separate mountain directly south from the Hotaka Range.  Though the Hotaka Range is mostly obscured from view in downtown Takayama, I do have a clear view of these mountains everyday from my junior high school in <a href="/old/v7/december-snow-2" title="/december-snow-2">Kiyomi</a>.</p><p>I rolled out of bed around 10:30am, climbed into my car, and drove the 70 minutes to the ropeway station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Shinhotaka Ropeway is a gondola ride that brings you to a station 2155 meters in the sky.  It rests on a plateau on the side of Mount Nishihotakadake <span class='ja'>西穂高岳</span>, which has an altitude of 2909 meters.  </p><div class='title'><b>Shinhotaka Ropeway - Lower Station</b></div><p>There are two stations at the bottom of the mountain, and another gondola ride between them.  I parked at the lower station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The above photo shows a counterweight passing by.  This is used to balance the weight from the other car carrying passengers.  The lower ropeway used to have two cars running on its ropeway, but on January 19th, they had an accident.  One of the cars (carrying 8 people at the time) was swaying back and forth and smashed into one of the support structures.  One woman was injured, but not seriously.</p><p>On January 31st, only the second ropeway had reopened, and not until last week, March 20th, had full service resumed operation.  The cause is not fully known yet, but I think they're simply blaming it on the heavy winds from that day.  Here's an article about it: <a href="http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2015031690200848.html" title="http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2015031690200848.html">click!</a>.</p><p>Inside the station, I bought my ticket, and waited for my ride.  Entry is 2900<span class='ja'>円</span> ($29), which is not really that cheap.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On our way to the main ropeway station, the cabin attendant mentioned the accident over the intercom.  This made some people gasp, and look around nervously.  Of course, it was not windy in the slightest this day.  Only a breeze.</p><div class='title'><b>Shinhotaka Ropeway - Second Station</b></div><p>From the second station, the gondola cars are much bigger, much bulkier, and much safer, too.  We continued to ascend, and the summit came closer and closer.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We arrived.

If you ever have the chance to come to the Shinhotaka Ropeway, you ABSOLUTELY must try the wasabi ice cream, which is rather unique to the ropeway.  I haven't seen this flavor available anywhere else.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are two very strong flavors that are completely opposite.  There's the sweet, cold delicious taste of the ice cream.  And there's the hot, spicy, sometimes incapacitating flavor of wasabi.  I think some people avoid wasabi as much as possible because it's so potent.  I think that wasabi ice cream is a rare chance where the spiciness is so overpowered by the ice cream, you can actually taste wasabi for its distinct flavor, rather than its hot spicy texture.</p><p>Initially, you are hit by the sweetness of the ice cream.  For the first few seconds, it just tastes like normal ice cream.  But as the taste lingers in your mouth, and spice of wasabi starts to set and grow.  It's not hot, or overpowering.  It's just the flavor.</p><p>It's so good.  It's really the absolute softest safest approach to consuming wasabi.  All wasabi and almost none of the spice.</p><div class='title'><b>Foot Bath</b></div><p>One of my favorite places is on the way back to central Takayama.  Just west of Tochio <span class='ja'>栃尾</span>, is <span class='ja'>火山の恵</span> <span class='ja'>広場</span>, which apparently translates as the Volcano Wisdom Plaza.  Here you can pay 100<span class='ja'>円</span> ($1), and soak your tired feet for the recommended 30 minutes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hot, scalding, therapeutic waters burn away dead skin cells and excite the muscles.  After, your skin is left clean of death, and very smooth.  Several times, I exited the bath, and walked in the snow to flash fry and freeze my feet.  It didn't completely work.  Also, the bath really wasn't all that hot on this day.  Maybe I'm getting used to scalding water on my feet, though.</p><p>Sitting down, and burning away your feet would be a nice relaxing end to a day of hiking.  But for me, it was simply the end of a day riding a gondola.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hina Matsuri ひな祭り in Hida no Sato 飛騨の里" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato">Hina Matsuri ひな祭り in Hida no Sato 飛騨の里</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 12, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For my final 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> and 6<span class='ja'>年生</span> classes of the year, we played <b>Four Square</b>.  This was a game my friends and I played quite a bit back in elementary school, so I thought it would be fun to teach students this game, and see what they thought.  I'm pretty sure it's still played today in American elementary schools.</p><div class='title'><b>Initial Plans</b></div><p>Originally, I wanted to do something else this year, since I had done Four Square <a href="/old/v7/lessons-h25-special-four-square" title="/lessons-h25-special-four-square">last year</a>.  But scheduling classes at the end of the year is difficult as graduation practice is very important and takes over much of the schedule.  In order to have a final game for a class, I would have to teach all 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> together at one of my schools.</p><p>Whatever.  I pulled out my Four Square plan from last year, and suggested we could do this in the gym with everyone together.  We found a free period for the gym, and scheduled the 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> class for that time, then scheduled all my other classes around that.</p><p>And yesterday, we played!</p><div class='title'><b>Set Up</b></div><p>Last year, I made only 2 four square courts.  I had 80 students, and was able to teach each class at a time.  Everyone had a great time, but with 20 kids per court, many kids were bored on the side lines waiting to get into the game.  They didn't pay attention half the time, and just sat with their friends doing whatever.</p><p>Given the space we had in the full gym, and all 70 students this year together, we were able to make 6 courts.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4693.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4693.webp" /></p><p>The night before we were to play Four Square, I went to school.  The 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> teachers and I laid down the tape to create 6 courts.  As you can see above, we cheated a little bit and used some existing lines.</p><p>Each court is 5 meters by 5 meters, and then divided down the middle at the 250 cm mark.  Since we cheated, these courts were actually 470 cm in "diameter".  Whatever, close enough.</p><p>I bought this tape at my local Daiso <span class='ja'>ダイソ</span>, which is a chain of 100<span class='ja'>円</span> stores.  Each roll of tape had 16m.  2 rolls were required to make one complete court.  So, I bought 12 rolls to cover the 6 courts we had planned.  Since we used those existing lines, we only used 6 rolls.  Plus I had some left over from last year, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4692.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4692.webp" /></p><p>We also laid out the tape for the numbers.  Number 1 and 4 must be opposed, but other than that, the layout of the numbers doesn't matter at all.  And really, that 1-4 rule is considered more of a "house rule" anyway.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's Play!</b></div><p>I had already thoroughly explained the rules to my teachers, so they already knew how to play.  We even played a few practice rounds together after making the courts so everyone fully understood the rules.</p><p>During class, I explained the rules in English, and they would translate for the students that couldn't understand.  Eventually the teachers took over the explanation since we had to stop every minute to tell the kids the shut up.</p><p>It took a little while to explain all the rules but many of the students understood.  We got 5 students as volunteers, and had them play a mock game to further demonstrate the rules for the students.  Then they were off!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4663_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The teachers and I each went to a court to referee some students and get them started.  We explained that if you are waiting in line, you must referee the game, too.</p><p>Everything went AMAZING.  So smooth.  Way smoother than last year.  Last year, there was at least one student in all my classes left crying.  Other students got really pissed off when they lost.  There was none of that this year.  All the 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> were very sportsmanlike in their defeat, and victories.</p><p>Having the extra courts really kept the students moving and into the game.  Also, any fight or contested result was simply met with a do-over.  <span class='ja'>もう一回</span>!  We weren't keeping score, so there were no real stakes.  5 or 6 games of waiting in line, and you were back into it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4673.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_foursquare/IMG_4684.webp"/></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>For the first 10 minutes, we made everyone stick to their teams.
