| July 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Throughout my life, I can count a number of cultural keystones that have dramatically shaped my tastes and perceptions.  Keystones in the form of music, movies, television, video games and combinations of these forms of entertainment.</p><p>Around 1995 was when I finally heard that pulsing electronic sound that has been with me every since.  I heard it on television from MTV's Amp.  I heard it from video games in Wipeout XL.  I heard it in the movies from Hackers.  Drowning in a raging auditory ocean of Rock, Pop, Country, Oldies, this distant dynamic sound was so completely different.  Once I heard these tracks and that sound, I knew I had found music that was for me.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple years later that I discovered Sasha and other DJs that really opened my eyes and ears to the Electronic Music genre as a whole.  But for a time, I had a couple songs that were my own.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Had I seen <b>Trainspotting</b> back in my youth, it probably would've been sitting alongside those I mentioned earlier.  Trainspotting is very rich in music, character, life, satire..  There's some amazing camera shots, and scene transitions..  This movie has it all.</p><p>10 years ago, I would've watched this movie again and again, dissected every scene, put meaning to the randomness, placed myself in character's shoes..  But today, I'm just along for the ride.  Trainspotting oozes with Youth, especially seeing a young Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller, and Kelly MacDonald run around in their low to mid 20s.</p><p>The music and the faces bring me back 10 years to the mid-ish 90s.  Young and ripe.  It's the same feeling I get whenever I pop in Hackers or listen to Atom Bomb, Papua New Guinea, Cowgirl, Halcyon.. (by Fluke, Future Sound of London, Underworld, Orbital).</p><p>I'm not sure if anyone else's brain works this way, but a specific melody or tune can bring back the most vibrant memories of my past than words or stories.  Whenever I hear Atom Bomb, I'm instantly transported back to my room at age 16ish watching Amp on MTV's around 2 in the morning.  Whenever I hear the Facility background music from Goldeneye 007, I'm instantly transported to Justin's Mom's house in Wayzata playing N64 with him around 11pm after working at Toys R Us for the night.</p><p>I guess the same works with images too, but it's not as powerful as hearing.  It's a powerful touchstone at a singular point in my life that can always be revived by that distinctive sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Anyways, I'm sure I would've loved this movie If I saw it back then.  But better late than never, I suppose. ^_^.</p><p>As mentioned before, Ewan McGregor is the main star of this movie, who has gone on to be young Obi-wan Kenobi in the Star Wars Pre-Trilogy.  Kelly MacDonald is in this movie too!  In fact, it's her very first role in a movie.  She's the wife in No Country for Old Men.  Also, Paige Marshall in Choke.</p><p>Also, Trainspotting is directed by Danny Boyle, whom you might know as the director of Slumdog Millionaire.  He also directed 28 Days Later.</p><p>It's also interesting that almost all the actors in Trainspotting are actually scottish, except for Johnny Lee Miller.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xtro" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xtro">Xtro</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>About a week ago, I saw one of the cheesiest, most bizarre movies I've ever seen, Xtro.  I have no idea how I came across this title.  Nor do I know how it became to exist in my Netflix queue.  But, I'm quite glad that I had the pleasure of viewing this treasure.</p><p>Xtro is ultimately about a boy.  Little Tony is scarred at a young age by the disappearance of his father, Sam.  They were out for an ordinary game of catch, when POOF!  Aliens appear from beyond the mountains and abduct Sam.  Alone, Tony grieves for his loss.  Returning home, no one believes him.  Those who don't know the truth believe that Sam had run away from his responsibilities as a father.  The aliens couldn't have picked a worse time to intervene as things hadn't really been going well at home.</p><p>3 years later, things have actually turned out better for everyone except Tony.  His mother is now with a cool hunky photographer.  They live in downtown London where all the magic happens.  Tony has a super hot babysitter who gets naked several times throughout the film.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tony has recurring nightmares of his father's abduction.  He wakes throughout the night from his own screams and whimpers.  Alas, his mother still does not believe him.  "Quite whining and shut up about that ridiculous lie.  He left us!"  She would say as she burst into his room, afterward returning to her bed with her super-fly boyfriend.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the forests outside of London the aliens return!  They appear above the trees and deposit an odd creature.  An infantile organism that begins to adapt and move across the forest bed...  it finds the smooth pavement of a nearby road, and then suddenly finds the bumper of an oncoming car.  Shocked by ramming such a weird looking animal, the automobile stops and its occupants search for the wounded being.  Of course, the alien finds them first.</p><p>Meanwhile, later, the alien finds itself upon a cabin in the woods with a lone female occupant.  You may guess what might happen next.  Bow-chicka-wow-wow...  The alien impregnates the woman and runs off.  Never to be seen in the film again.  Startled by such an event, the young woman is dazed but then feels the fetus inside her.</p><p>The fetus rapidly grows and...  here's a clip of what happens next as she gives birth...  [find it on youtube]</p><p>It's Sam!  Sam is back from outer space and ready to relive his life as Tony's father.  Of course he doesn't actually remember being abducted.</p><p>As you might expect, drama occurs, then murder, then boobs, then it gets weird.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>Ultimately, Sam's purpose for return was to retrieve Tony.  But in order for Tony to adapt to space travel, he must under go a transformation process.  Sam bestows the power to overcome adaption to space.  As the power matures inside of Tony, he gains the power to materialize his hallucinations. But ultimately, he's taken over by the power's control.</p><p>Tony's first order of business is to create a friend.  The friend that he's always wanted!  A creepy clown midget will do.  Next!  Kill all my annoying neighbors with life sized versions of my toys.  Kill my asshole step dad.  Kill that asshole elderly woman, downstairs.  Kill the hot naked babysitter for some reason.  Actually, wait a minute.  Don't kill her.  Knock her out.  Mutate her womb.  And then collect the alien eggs she produces.  Next!  Tip over the refrigerator.  Fill it with Guacamole.  And use it as an incubator for more aliens.  The perfect plan!</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam lures Mom back to the forest.  Tony appears.  And off they go to Never Never Land.  Leaving the mom a wake of bodies and loneliness on earth.</p><p>The end.</p><div class='title'><b>Bold!</b></div><p>I wish the Science Fiction movies of today had the bizarre spin of movies from the late 70s, early 80s.  Has there been a horror movie in the past 5 or 10 years that has made you cringe and yell out, "Oh my god?!"  I think Hostel has really been the only one I can think of.  And maybe Event Horizon to an extent.</p><p>Why aren't movies this bold anymore?</p><p>Actually, now that I think of it...  Asian torture films as of late have been quite brutal.  Audition was one of the most difficult films to stomach (so to speak).  That film is painful.  Maybe I should watch more of those...</p><div class='title'><b>Moog!</b></div><p>Besides the unbridled gore, wacky retro outfits and attitudes, Xtro has an amazing soundtrack.  In fitting with the late 70s, early 80s, the score is entirely composed with a Moog Synthesizer.  The Moog synth is vital in setting the tone of the movie consistent with the era in which is was produced.  A very organic sound with an outright alien tynch.  Atmospheric tone standing on the brink of technology.</p><p>Xtro is bizarre enough for me to love to begin with, but the beautiful crafted soundtrack keeps me locked in with the experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The end...?</b></div><p>The ending of the <b>Xtro</b> is left open.  There are some alternate endings on the DVD, but ultimately the alien eggs hatch and you're left to figure out what happens next.</p><p>There are two sequels following Xtro, but have absolutely nothing to do with the original movie, nor each other.  Both sequels feature military teams combating an alien menace.  Xtro 2 (released in 1990) is an Alien ripoff, and Xtro 3 (released in 1995) is a Predator ripoff.  Both films are god awful.  Neither has nudity.  Neither has grotesque horror.</p><p>Everything unique about Xtro 1 was completely generic in its sequels.  The story.  The characters.  The setting.  The action.  The circumstances.  The music.</p><p>Xtro 1 was pretty low budget, but they made up for it with imagery you'd never see anywhere else.  Xtro 2 and 3 are wannabe copies of blockbuster films that try to bring the franchise back into reality.  They are not bold, nor eye catching.  They are sad imitations that I regret ever watching.</p><p>Anyways, definitely check out <b>Xtro</b> on Netflix, but forget about the sequels.</p><p>Also, I swiped that Clip from <a href="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/" title="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/" title="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/">Badmovies.org's Review of Xtro</a>.

Atlus is a North American publisher that spends a lot of time and attention on presentation and limited edition releases of their games.  They generally publish a lot of RPGs, including their own super-popular RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei.

especially Digital Devil Saga 2.  I would buy every single one of these games, except the PX sells them for MSRP.  Every PS2 game is $50, every PSP game $40, and every NDS game $35.  It's a treasure trove, but at a cost!</p><p>So that's probably why they still have so many copies of these games.  Why buy a $50 PS2 game that full of pussy Japanese bullshit, when I can buy a badass FPS for the Xbox 360 for only $10 more?!  Riddle me that, civilian!</p><p>Anyways, as you can see in these pictures, they don't have just a few copies of these games in stock.  They have a whole bunch of copies.  And it's not just this PX too.  When Justin was stationed in North Carolina, I picked up copies of Devil Summoner 1 and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne.  Both of which are Atlus published (and developed) games.</p><p>I find it really odd that these military posts have such a huge surplus of these games.  And!  That no one on-base buys any of them.  You'd think the rules of Supply and Demand would be enforced here, but they aren't.  The next time I return to Florida to visit Justin, there will be just as many Atlus games as there were on this trip.  It's really odd.</p><p>They need to put all their Atlus titles on sale or clearance or something.  Hopefully when they do, it'll be the same weekend I'm down there.  My half.com store will have a glut of fantastic games, again!</p><div class='title'><b>Not just Atlus</b></div><p>Atlus is the most prominently published games, but there are plenty of other unappreciated titles on those shelves.</p><p>There were copies of Okami, God Hand, Soul Nomad, and Rhapsody.  There were copies of other NIS games, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp"  /></p><p>If you happen to know someone in our Armed Forces, visit them and take a look at the video game stock at their PX.

Also, the local Best Buy had some sweet deals on poorly selling games, so I bought a copy of Eat Lead: Matt Hazard for $15.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4327.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4328.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock for Sale Restock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-restock">Schlock for Sale Restock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>I'm a huge fan of the Ghostbusters.  Like many people my age, I grew up with the movies and Saturday morning TV show.  I used to pretend I was a Ghostbuster, and run around the backyard with my friends busting ghosts.  Recently, I started getting into the <em>spirit</em> of things thanks to hearing the Ghostbusters theme song at every 80s Night @ Inferno.</p><p>So when I first saw that demo-real footage of this game that popped up online out of the blue back in early 2008, I was completely blown away (ign.com).  Not only was it a next-gen Ghostbustin' game, but it looked really really good.  It didn't look like some cobbled together FPS.  It looked very fluid and real.  Amazing.</p><p>Since this footage came out of nowhere, no one seemed to know anything about it.  A couple days later, after the blogs had done all their research, fact finding and scooping, I knew a little bit more about it.  It was slated for a Fall 2008 release, and was developed by Terminal Reality, whose credits were somewhat poor.  Blood Rayne was their only claim to fame.</p><p>But it looked great, and after a shaky delay due to loss of publisher, Atari picked up the Distribution rights and it finally came out June 16th 2009 (20 years after Ghostbusters II premiered in theaters).</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>A couple weeks after that, Gamely finally sent me a copy for the Playstation 3 and so far, I've been having a great time with it.  Ghostbusters is pretty damn fun. ^_^</p><p>Zach and Justin had mentioned how much they were enjoying the game.  They commented that it was like being in a Ghostbusters film.  And I'd have to agree with them so far.  Egon, Ray, Venkman, and Winston are perfect renditions of their original roles.</p><p>I should hope so considering this game was even possible thanks to Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.  They wrote and developed the story and got everyone back to reprise their original roles.  Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are all voices their original characters.  Annie Potts returns as Janine.  William Atherton returns as Walter Peck.  They've also got Brian Doyle-Murray as the Mayor, and Alyssa Milano as the female lead.</p><p>And this cast works fantastic together.  The dialogue and character balance works perfectly together and forms a new, completely unique entry to the Ghostbusters franchise.  This really feels like the "next" Ghostbusters.  In fact, Dan Aykroyd has said in an interview, "This is essentially the third movie."</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>In Ghostbusters, you play as a new recruit.  You don't actually play one of the original Ghostbusters.  (Though, you might in Multiplayer.. I don't know).  Your character rarely ever speaks, and even though you're the one doing the bulk of the Ghostbustin', you really are on the side lines for the story.</p><p>It actually works out perfectly.  This is the <b>first game</b> in which I play the silent "main" character, and feel like I'm totally immersed in the game's story.  Maybe that's because I'm not the main character.  I'm part of an ensemble cast.  They're the real stars and I'm the support.  For the most part, I'm watching them unravel the story, and speak their hilarious lines.</p><p>But, I'm still totally part of their group.  Bustin' Ghosts is completely a team effort.  They'll throw out their traps while I've captured a ghost in my proton stream.  They'll revive me if I'm knocked down.  And I do the same for them.  They're my pals!</p><div class='title'><b>Virtual Monument</b></div><p>Many of the areas in the game are 3D imaginings of places from the movies.  You can walk around the Ghostbuster HQ, you go to the Sedgewick Hotel featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go to the New York Public Library, also featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go the Historical Museum, as featured in Ghostbusters 2.</p><p>You also come across many artifacts from the two movies.  In fact, the painting of Vigo (from Ghostbusters II) is sitting in the garage of the Ghostbuster HQ.  There are tons of references from the original movies, as well as pop culture from the late 80s.</p><p>Taking a virtual tour of these sets reminds me a lot of <b>Lost Via Domus</b>.  In the Lost game, you play a new character and discover the world of Lost for yourself.  You can walk around the hatch, the beach, the pearl station.  You find artifacts like the VW bus, the 2 skeletons.  You follow the river through the Jungle.  The characters are voiced by their actual actors.  I wrote about this back on <a href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus" title="/lost-via-domus" title="/lost-via-domus">August 24th, 2008</a>.  It's a virtual world.</p><p>Of course, the big difference is that Ghostbusters the game was written and "created" by their original cast and creators.  Lost Via Domus was a simple fan fiction written by huge fans of the show, who happen to work at Ubisoft.</p><div class='title'><b>Perfect Pacing</b></div><p>Ghostbusters is pretty linear, and has some very gamey pacing.  The game is split up into several different missions.  Chapters, really.  Each chapter is about 2 or 3 hours long depending on how much time you waste blowing stuff up, or searching for artifacts.</p><p>In my opinion, 2 to 3 hours is a perfect length for a chapter.  It's just long enough that you can get through a chapter in one sitting. After you finish a chapter, everyone is back at Ghostbusters HQ figuring out what to do next.  It's the perfect point to set down the controls for the next time you get back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Definitely Play this Game!</b></div><p>If you are or were a fan of the Ghostbusters and LOVE nostalgia, you definitely need to play this game.  I would still suggest renting it though as $60 is still quite a price to pay.</p><p>One thing to note, the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions are identical and were the ones written by the original cast. The Wii, Playstation 2, Nintendo DS, and PSP versions were developed by some other developer and are probably utter crap.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dropkick Murphys, Offspring, &amp; KISS @ Summerfest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dropkick-murphys-offspring-and-kiss-summerfest">Dropkick Murphys, Offspring, &amp; KISS @ Summerfest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

As soon as they opening riff hit from All I Want "Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah," the place exploded and I felt in harmony with the crowd.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4133.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I wrote about this in another post, but when you have crowds this massive and fully engaged in the music, it creates a feeling of synesthesia. You become part of the crowd and the crowd becomes one. It's obviously such a rush that it is easy linked and often enchanced to other mind altering substances. Also, obviously, this is the rush that people chase when going to concerts, especially of their favorite bands.</p><p>Both Dropkick Murphys and Offspring (proper) are completely outside of my musical wheelhouse, but their songs create a complete overwhelming sense of energy that it's hard not to get caught up in the wave of energy. And then fully ride that wave of energy when they perform a song you are actually in tune with.</p><p>There were plenty of other bands at Summerfest and other concerts I attended with friends where I was out of my element, but could still recognize the waves. I felt weird and awkward to "get into" the music when it was not me. Those moments always made me look forward to my next outing to a club to slip into the music I love.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090626_summerfest/IMG_4215.webp" /></a></p><p>However, the real awkwardness didn't occur until the next day, when we returned to watch KISS perform on the main stage. To be fair, we weren't standing in the pit for this one. We were sitting on the grass way in the back with the divorced dads. Pretty hard to be part of any synesthesia when the middle school girl in front of you is complaining to her father.</p><p>Seeing KISS live was more of a checkbox on a bucket list at this point, but they still put on a pretty okay of their hits. They were showing their age, though, as their songs didn't quite have the same energy or vocals as the recorded version of their songs from decades earlier.</p><p>Musically, it was great to get out of my element, but it really just pushed me back into the clubs.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Mar 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hybrid I Choose Noise" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hybrid-i-choose-noise">Hybrid I Choose Noise</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 24, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>10 years ago, the electronic music group Hybrid released their first studio album, <b>Wide Angle</b>.  Wide Angle had an unprecedented sound that brought a cinematic quality to electronica.  The album carried the tone and flow of an epic experience and ended with one of their most celebrated tracks of all time: Finished Symphony.</p><p>Wide Angle definitely set a trend among producers and music makers, who begin adding a little cinematic flair to some of their music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/wideanglescifi.webp"  /></p><p>In 2003, Hybrid took a slightly different musical approach with their second album, <b>Morning Sci Fi</b>.  They added a base guitarist, and lead guitarist/singer.  They tried to distance themselves from their electronica roots and bring a more diversified set of sounds to their music.  Morning Sci Fi definitely still kept many of the cinematic tones they established in Wide Angle.  But they definitely led their songs heavy on the Guitar.</p><p>I actually saw them when the toured for Morning Sci Fi!  Man, I was so happy.  On November 14th, 2003, I completed one of my life goals at the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis: <a href="/old/v7/hybrid" title="/hybrid" title="/hybrid">Photos!</a> My friend at the time, Stu, got his synth signed, and I got some Vinyl Mats signed!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/IMG_4113.webp"  /></p><p>It doesn't have Chris Healings signature, though :/</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after that I became too busy finishing school, working, going to Japan, and being depressed after Japan that I missed out on their third album...  until now!</p><div class='title'><b>I Choose Noise</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090624_hybrid/ichoosenoise.webp"  /></p><p>In Late 2006, Hybrid released their third studio album, I Choose Noise.  It fetches a pretty high price on the Internet, actually.  Prices on <a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ55368631QQcpidZ1376705458" title="http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ55368631QQcpidZ1376705458" title="http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ55368631QQcpidZ1376705458">Half.com</a> are in the $125 range for new, $77 range for very good used.  Which is ridiculous!  Of course, who buys CDs these days, right?  You can download the entire album from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Choose-Noise/dp/B000S9FQNO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1245879554&amp;sr=8-2" title="http://www.amazon.com/I-Choose-Noise/dp/B000S9FQNO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1245879554&amp;sr=8-2" title="http://www.amazon.com/I-Choose-Noise/dp/B000S9FQNO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1245879554&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon</a> for a mere $9.  Screw those annoying collectors.</p><p><b>I Choose Noise</b> leaves the band behind from Morning Sci Fi and continues the electronic cinematic experience.  It feels like a true sequel to Wide Angle, but still learns from the sharp crisp sounds in Morning Sci Fi.  It brings both techniques together to form an absolute masterpiece.  It feels really odd that I skipped over this album for the past 3 years.</p><p>I know I'm a little late to the party of this one, but definitely check out I Choose Noise.  Also, check out their previous two albums if you missed 'em.  I Love Hybrid. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming Album #4</b></div><p>After touring for I Choose Noise, Hybrid has been working on their next album.  They blogged about it last month on <a href="http://www.distinctiverecords.com/news_150509.html" title="http://www.distinctiverecords.com/news_150509.html" title="http://www.distinctiverecords.com/news_150509.html">Distictive's website</a>.  Seems like what they original had last year didn't sit well with them.</p><p>But it sounds like they're back on track with something fantastic that should starting seeing the light of day around October 2009.  Here's hoping!</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update</span>: How embarrassing, I totally spelled Hybrid incorrectly in the title.  It's fixed now.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to iPhone 3GS" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/iphone-3gs">iPhone 3GS</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On Friday morning last week, I got up bright and early, like I do every day.  Except today was different.  I took the day off work.  Instead of waiting for the bus in front of my apartment building, I went down the block and got on a different bus.  One that took me over to my local At&amp;t where, 11 days prior, I had paid for my new cell phone!</p><p>My new cell phone is the fancy iPhone 3GS, which At&amp;t had opened its doors early for.  I was 5th in line when I arrived and 40 minutes later, I walked out of the door with my new phone.</p><div class='title'><b>My previous phone</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4092.webp"  /></p><p>For the last 2 1/2 years, I've been using the 8525.  After careful research and comparisons which I blogged about here (<a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars">Jan 23rd, 2007</a>) and here (<a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars-part-2" title="/cellular-wars-part-2" title="/cellular-wars-part-2">Feb 5th, 2007</a>), I bought this phone because it could do Japanese and was compatible with Japan's cellular signals.</p><p>This was the first cellphone and cellphone contract I've ever done!  I was excited and had a lot of fun with it...  at first.  But as time went on, the 8525 degraded and felt apart like a cheap pencil.  These days, I can't hold a conversation longer than 1.5 hours without the fully charged battery dying.  Windows Mobile 5 crashes all the damn time.  And it is very slow when doing the simplest of Internet tasks.</p><p>Ever since my contract had run its 2 year course, I could not wait to get rid of that piece of shit.  We had some good times, but some things in life just aren't meant to last.  We all knew that the 3rd generation iPhone was coming out sometime this Summer.  So, I was patient.  I needed only to wait.  And 2 weeks ago, Apple finally announced that it would coming the Friday after next.</p><div class='title'><b>iPhone 3GS</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/IMG_4112.webp"  /></p><p>Friday finally arrived, and with it brought my iPhone.  That general fancy-gadget excitement had returned!  I felt just as anxious and optimistic when I first got my 8525.  Not only do I have a fancy new phone, but I actually have an iPod now.  All these years, I've still been buying and using CDs like a caveman.  In fact, the reason I've been slacking off on blogging again was because I spent last week ripping all my CDs and importing them in iTunes.  I was preparing!</p><p>After my first 5 days with this thing, I love it.  It blows my previous phone out of the water and does so much more.  Much like when I first got the 8525, I feel like I'm carrying around a little personal computer.  Most everything I do on the Internet, can be done on the iPhone.  So if I'm away for the weekend, I can easily keep up with News or whatever without clunking around my laptop.</p><p>The iPhone isn't the only fancy phone on the market these days.  Palm released its <b>Palm Pre</b> about a month ago.  The Palm Pre is a little amazing piece of technology of its own.  It's every bit good as the iPhone...  except there is one thing that the Palm Pre <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely</span> does not have.</p><div class='title'><b>Video games</b></div><p>Thanks to the overwhelming market share, the iPhone has started becoming a contender in the game market.  Game Developers are actually starting to take it seriously, to an extent.  The larger developer studios mostly see it as a quick way to make some money, like with <b>Metal Gear Solid Touch</b> and <b>I Love Katamari</b>.</p><p>But some PC studios have released their full fledged games on the iPhone, like Gameloft with <b>Oregon Trail</b> and Popcap Games with <b>Peggle</b> and a few others.</p><p>Not only that, but in the next few months, we'll see the release of the <b>Dexter</b> iPhone game.  Which will be the first "high" budget, full-fledged released iPhone game.  In the game, you carefully stalk your victims, building a case as to why they should killed.  You justify their murders, kidnap them, and justify your decision to their face.  If you correctly uphold the law of Harry, and don't get caught or let your guard down, you win.</p><p>The Dexter iPhone game had an impressive showing at E3 where many journalists compared it to the Phoenix Wright series on the DS.  That should come out in July.</p><p>But anyways, I've been having a great time with the games I have so far.  Here are the games I've bought so far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/shot_watch.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/peggle.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/katamari.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/metal_gear.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/oregon_trail.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090623_iphone/mass_effect.webp"  /></p><p>The reason I started off with these games was that I wanted to see what established console and PC developers were trying to do with the iPhone.

| June 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>There's a couple other things I'd like to mention concerning Metroid before I drop the subject for a while.  I find it somewhat odd that I've had Metroid on the brain so much since the announcement of Metroid Other M.  I'm a huge Zelda fan, but I guess I never really considered myself that big of a Metroid fan.  I think a lot of that fandom was taken away by Metroid Prime</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b></div><p>I think the Metroid Prime series adds a whole lot of glitz and glamor and takes away from some of the charm and prestige that Metroid garnished on the Super Nintendo.  I thought it was nice that they took it a different direction than Legend of Zelda for the transition to 3D, but it felt empty.  There was no emotion in the game.</p><p>Anyways, I still think Metroid Prime 1 and Metroid Prime 3 are pretty fun games.  And I think what makes Metroid Prime 3 so great is the fluid controls of the Wii-mote.  So far I think it's one of the best designed games on the Wii.</p><p><b>Luckily!</b>, Nintendo is re-hashing many of their Gamecube classics with Wii-mote / Nunchuck "enhanced" controls.  Nintendo has announced that in August, they'll release <b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b>.  A collection of all 3 Metroid Prime games with Wii-controls for a mere $50.</p><p>For those of you who missed Metroid Prime 1 or 2, or who loved the new controls of Metroid Prime 3, this is the perfect opportunity to revisit these games and experience the full "story" arc of the Metroid Prime series.</p><div class='title'><b>The Emotion of Super Metroid</b></div><p>I think what makes Super Metroid so rich are the emotional moments experienced between Samus and her Metroid hatchling.  Samus found the Metroid hatching after traversing the depths of SR388 uncovering a horrible grotesque plot of Metroid mutation.  The Metroid hatching thinks of Samus as her mother, and there are a couple moments where this mother/child relation fosters itself into something few games did at that time.</p><p>2 years ago, Chad Concelmo of Destructriod wrote an article that focused primarily on this aspect of the game in full detail.  It's a great read: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml">The Memory Card .01: The return of Baby Metroid</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid 2 - fan remake</b></div><p>Metroid 2 is probably the most difficult to replay out of any Metroid game.  Released in 1992 for the Game Boy, Metroid II has not been officially re-released since its debut.  Every Metroid game except Metroid 2 can be played on a modern gaming device.  (Unless you discount the DS Lite due to the DSi release)  You'd need to find a Gameboy Advance in order to play Metroid 2.</p><p>Anyways, Project AM2R has been working on a remake of the game to make it more playable for today's generation.</p><p>Here's their most recent trailer:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="505" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="505" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>It looks pretty fantastic. ^_^.

| June 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>When Metroid Prime was released in 2002, Nintendo finally had their answer to western First Person Shooters.  Golden Eye and Perfect Dark were legends, but NOW! Nintendo had one of their core franchises in the FPS spotlight.  And felt they had something that contended with the Halo crowd on the Xbox.</p><p>Metroid Prime was the first Metroid game since Super Metroid released 8 years prior, so it was a pretty big deal considering the success of Super Metroid.  Nintendo created Retro Studios, an American based developer who jumped at the chance to make this game.  Shigeru Miyamoto and Yoshio Sakamoto were in regular contact to make sure the game was within Nintendo's vision.</p><p>The third dimension worked great for Nintendo and Metroid Prime became the Gamecube's #6 best selling games of all time with 2.7 million units.  2.7 million doesn't sound like a lot, but keep in mind only 21.7 million Gamecubes were sold worldwide.  Over 10% attach rate is not bad.  (Side Note: Super Smash Brothers Melee is the best selling Gamecube game at 6.1 million units sold, which is a little over 25%.)</p><p>2 years later, Retro Studios released Metroid Prime 2 which continued where Metroid Prime 1 left off.  The FPS gameplay had become iconic for the Metroid series and the idea of a 2D side scrolling adventure became more of a treasured memory of Super Metroid.</p><p>Though, <b>those traditional roots have not been forgotten!</b> They've been merely overshadowed by the graphical splendor.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Fusion</b></div><p>Metroid Fusion is the <b>actual sequel to Super Metroid</b>.  In fact, the opening credits say Metroid 4.  I think this game get overlooked because it was <b>released on the exact same day as Metroid Prime</b>.  Gamers were far more interested in the new fresh look on the Gamecube, rather than an outdated gaming experience on the Gameboy Advance.</p><p>Metroid Fusion's development was headed by Yoshio Sakamoto and everyone else who worked on Super Metroid.  Nintendo still wanted a traditional follow-up to Super Metroid, so they did.  And on November 17th, 2002, fans got a traditional sequel with Metroid Fusion and a fresh perspective on the series with Metroid Prime.  But gamers made their choice.  Where Metroid Prime ultimately sold 2.7 million, Metroid Fusion sold just a little over 1 million.  Metroid Prime was the star.</p><p>Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime are interesting entries in the series.  It's interesting in that Metroid Prime had a radically different way to play the game, but the design was incredibly traditional.  It had the familiar look of Samus and all the same items you remembered from Super Metroid.  Metroid Fusion played the exact same way you remembered from Super Metroid, but the story and character designs were quite different than what you remembered.</p><p>Metroid Fusion has a bunch of cutscenes, text and dialogue that progress the story.  There's actual plot!  The environment, characters, and enemies are all <b>very cohesive</b> and build a decent story.  Unfortunately, the game is incredibly linear which is a big negative for a traditional Metroid.  The game opens up once you beat it, but <b>there are power-ups you can miss!</b> What the hell is that crap?!</p><p>Through and though, Metroid Fusion isn't half bad.  <b>If you liked Super Metroid, I'd totally recommend it</b>. ^_^  Now that I know what happens in Metroid Fusion, <b>I'm pretty interested to see how Metroid Other M fits in to the story.</b> Though, as a big fan of Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion was a let down.  It's good, but not Super Metroid good.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Zero Mission</b></div><p>Metroid Prime 1 was pretty sweet and made Metroid Prime 2 just as highly anticipated.  So much so, that you may have overlooked the very fantastic <b>Metroid Zero Mission</b> released 6 months prior.  You may have also overlooked it because it's a remake.  You may have also overlooked it because word of mouth said Metroid Fusion wasn't so great.  You may have overlooked it because it's on the Gameboy Advance and not the Gamecube.  Whatever...</p><p>Metroid Zero Mission is a remake of the first entry in the series, the original 1986 Metroid.  It's nearly identical through and through, but with tighter graphics, faster, more responsive controls, and more weapons than Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.  Plus, Zero Mission extends the original Plot to fit better into the overall time line of the Metroid series.</p><p><b>Metroid Zero Mission is fantastic</b>.  It is every bit as good as Super Metroid. And it's sad that it's one of the poorest selling titles in the series at around half a million units sold worldwide.</p><p>After finishing Metroid Fusion, I played a little Zero Mission for the first time in a while and it is so smooth.  Metroid Fusion is like a step back.  Half the time, Samus doesn't move how I want her to move.  The same is with going back to Super Metroid.  Those controls are outdated and Metroid Zero Mission is incredibly modern.</p><p>Much like Super Metroid is to the Super Nintendo, Metroid Zero Mission is one of the best games the Gameboy Advance has to offer.  <b>If you're a fan of Super Metroid, you've got to play this game.</b></p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Other M perspective</b></div><p>Playing through these Metroid games only feed my hype for Metroid Other M.  This is the first game that Yoshio Sakamoto has been deeply involved with since Metroid Zero Mission.  But I don't want to get my hopes up too much.</p><p>It seems like Sakamoto's development team can't really handle the 3rd dimension.  Their original Metroid game for Nintendo 64 Disk Drive was scrapped because it was a mess.  Then, Retro Studios picked up the project and basically started completely over.  The same thing was probably going on again with Project M, until they brought in Team Ninja to bring the 3D nature of the game up to quality.</p><p>I really wonder where Metroid 64 fits into the time line.  Did they take the story and recode it as Metroid Fusion?  Or Do you think this story will finally see the light of day as Metroid Other M?  I think it's probably the latter.  I'm guessing that Metroid Other M is the final product of Metroid 64.  Since it's story was probably too big for the Gameboy Advance.  And Sakamoto probably wanted to keep this story close by rather than let Retro take it.</p><p>Anyways, I'm thinking too much into this.  Metroid Other M won't even be released for another year, and all this speculation and conjecture is really only based on the trailer and <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">Jeremy Parish's interview</a>.  It'll really just build it up to something that won't fit my dream.  Who knows, though.  It's fun to be surprised.</p><p>Previous thoughts on Metroid Other M: <a href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m" title="/metroid-other-m" title="/metroid-other-m">June 3rd</a>.</p><p><b>Anyways, check out Metroid Zero Mission.</b> ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/45">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/43">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
