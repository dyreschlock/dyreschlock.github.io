| October 6, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dosh &amp; Friends @ Cedar Culture Center, Minneapolis</b></div><p><em>Originally seen on December 27th, 2008</em></p><p>Last year, a few days after Christmas, my little sister and I went to a concert in Minneapolis that sounded kinda fun.  The concert was entitled Dosh &amp; Friends, with Dosh headlining, Dark Dark Dark opening for him, and DJ Odd Nosdam spinning some tunes in between sets.  I had never heard of any of these people before, but the event was gaining some acclaim on MNVibe, so I figured it would be a good idea to check out.</p><p>Well, It wasn't quite what I expected.  It was held in a large community center type room with a shit load of wooden folding chairs filling the entire space.  "Ok.. I guess it's a 'sit down' concert.." I thought.  Jess and I grabbed some seats up front since it was pretty empty.  As the room began to fill with more and more of Minneapolis' hippy youth, it was starting to dawn on me that the music we were going to hear tonight probably wasn't the type of electronic music that I frequent.</p><p>There were some pretty weird people hanging around and talking with each.  My little sister and I kept ourselves busy by pointing out some other these people to each other.  After 20 minutes rolled on by (we got there kinda early), the room will pretty full.  The lights dimmed.  And some of those people we noticed earlier took the stage.  It was Dark Dark Dark..  And the crowd went overly politely silent.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp"  /></p><p>They began singing some songs with the audience at complete attention.  After each tune, the audience cheered and applauded for about 15 to 20 seconds, and then DEAD silence.  I mean, absolute silence in the entire hall of 300 or 400 people.  Not a single word was spoken for another 10 seconds, and they began their next song.  After they finished their song, there was applause and cheer and SILENCE.  It was the weirdest, most awkward concert experience I've ever had.</p><p>But Dark Dark Dark plays some interesting music.  The accordion brings an incredible old Italian romantic feel to their songs.  The banjo keeps the songs from getting too serious, and adds a laid-back layer to the sound.  And they have some cellos to provide bass lines.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp"  /></p><p>Even though it's very different from the "normal" music I listen to, their songs were very passionate and conveyed a very unique sound.  It's romantic and lonely and desperate and very human.  It feels like so much of their lives are each of their songs.  After listening to their music, it's like I just had a long conversation with them about their lives and how they live.</p><p>After performing several songs, the atmosphere of The Cedar became a little less awkward.  Head band members Nona Marie Invie and Marshall LaCount began chatting a little bit between songs and provided some background context.  At first glance, I thought they were brother and sister, but my mind was blown when they first mentioned children.  I guess when people find their soul mate and embrace it, they begin slowly transforming into one person.</p><p>Their set lasted an hour and a half, I'd say..  After some setup Dosh, started his set, which was pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dark Dark Dark (opening for Why?) @ UW-Memorial Union, Madison</b></div><p><em>which happened today, October 6th 2009</em></p><p>A month ago, I noticed Dark Dark Dark were going to be in Madison.  Even though, the skies were dark, and winds were fierce, I braved the storms and went downtown to see 'em.  Upon entering UW-Memorial, the Rathskellar was full of Madison's hippy youth.  I immediately knew I was in the right spot.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp"  /></p><p>Once again, their performance started off awkward.  Not as awkward as absolute silence, but awkward for the opposite reason.  Too many fucking people talking.  There are 2 very big reasons for this.  #1) This concert was free.  #2) The Rathskellar sells Beer.  The inhabitants of Wisconsin are a bunch of loud obnoxious drunks, so when we get any amount of Beer in our systems, our self-consciousness and attention span goes right out the window.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of the on-stage conversation Dark Dark Dark was trying to have was different to hear because of the noise.  Nona asked the audience how many people were from Minneapolis and not a single person raised their hand.  She asked another question, which I couldn't quite make out, that also went unanswered.</p><p>Their music was still just as romantic and infectious as the first time I heard it.  They were only on stage for an hour, but throughout that hour the atmosphere had changed.  By the end, everyone was on their feet at the stage.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Snow Magic</b></div><p>Back in December, after hearing Dark Dark Dark, I felt compelled to purchase their album, and I did.  But, I hadn't ever been in the mood to actually listen to it.  After recanting all these feelings I've had listening to their music live, I haven't really listened to them on my own.  But, I still have the CD and plan on giving it a listen.</p><p>The Snow Magic is their only album out right now.  Though, at their show tonight, they had a Vinyl single that contains two remixes.  DJ Odd Nosdam remixes "Junk Bones", and Dosh remixes "All the Things".  It seems like all those guys are pretty tight. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5176.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Moby @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">Moby @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Fantastic.  I finally complete one of my life goals last Thursday.  I saw one of my favorite musical artists live on stage for the first time.  I haven't been with Moby since his beginning but since he released his album Play, I've been hooked.  Moby has a very infectious ambient sound that can calm my mood, but has been born out of a riot of punk and trance that he always keeps at his side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp"  /></p><p>Last Thursday, his concert displayed the range of his body of work.  It was like a concert of his greatest hits.  After a few songs, I thought it was a good idea to jot down his set list...</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. ???<br/>3. Wait for Me (Wait for Me)<br/>4. ???  (probably Jam for the Ladies)<br/>5. Bodyrock (Play)<br/>6. Go<br/>7. Pale Horses (Wait for Me)<br/>8. Great Escape (18)<br/>9. South Side (Play)<br/>10. In My Heart (18)<br/>11. ??? (Piano, "summer"?)<br/>12. Why Does My heart Feel so bad? (Play)<br/>13. We are all made of Stars (18)<br/>14. Porcelain (Play)<br/>15. "Take a walk on the Wild Side"<br/>16. Walk with me (Wait for Me)<br/>17. Natural Blues (Play)<br/>18. Porn Song from 1972<br/>19. Raining Again (Hotel)</p><p>Encore<br/>1. In this World (18)<br/>2. ??? (If I fall, let me go?)<br/>3. Extreme Ways (18)<br/>4. Honey (Play) + ???  (Guitar Hero)<br/>5. Feeling so Real</p><p>There are very very few concerts or musical events that I've attending where I knew the words to almost all the songs, but that I loved every minute of his 2 1/2 hour set.  In most concerts, the group only focuses on their most recent material...  Other groups are caught up in all their greatest hits from when they were good.  Even though, he played only a few songs from his new album, Wait for Me, Moby proves that his new album is stands along side his greatest songs.</p><p>With each song he played, the original melody and chrous was in tact, but was performed with the flavor and creativity building since its initial release.  Even though he "ended" with Raining Again, it wasn't the same version of the song you'd hear on the record from 2005.  He started off with the Porno music, and used that aura as a different direction to present the song.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics</b></div><p>After listening to The Protomen last year on <a href="/old/v7/the-protomen" title="/the-protomen">June 13th 2008</a>, I modify my opinion of Lyrics in Songs.  Even though, they skew or are sometimes inconsistent with the message of the music, they provide a very solid base for remixes and future adaptations, almost as strong as melody.  Well, lyrics are basically part of the melody.  The only difference is that Lyrics have a literal meaning in language, whereas melody is interpretive.</p><p>Both are essential for defining a song.  They are the key component for any remix.  If the remix has lost the melody of the original, it's a failure.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5122.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5122.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5128.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5128.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5128.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Live!</b></div><p>Seeing and listening to Moby perform Porcelain, We are all made of Stars, Go, and Raining Again LIVE in front of me is one of my most memorable music experiences in my life.

| October 4, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Katamari is a pretty simple game.  You roll up stuff, the Katamari gets larger, and The King of All Cosmos takes your ball of garbage (your Katamari), throws it in the sky and POOF! becomes a planet or a star or some other objects floating around in space.  Usually it's replacing something in space that The King had accidentally destroyed in the prologue story sequence.</p><p>In Katamari Damacy, released in 2004, you did exactly that.  There were 10 core levels to the game.  At the end of each level, you ended up with a larger Katamari than the last.  In the first levels, you were picking up dice, Mahjong pieces, maybe magazines.  Throughout the game, you'd grow larger enough to pick up humans, cars, houses, buildings, mountains, and islands..  In the final level, you'd end up with a Katamari almost 900m in diameter.</p><p>It was a unique game that stood on its own as a single release.  But with great popular, Namco demanded creator Keita Takahashi make a sequel.  He thought about what he would do to further the brand, and in 2005, released We Love Katamari.  The story of We Love Katamari centered on Takahashi's reaction to the outpouring support of Katamari Damacy.  Each level in the game is a request by a fan of Katamari Damacy, and almost all the levels center on unique challenges or environments rather than rolling the large Katamari possible.</p><p>Keita Takahashi said that Katamari should end at We Love Katamari, and went off to do something else with Namco.  Namco continued to milk this cash cow and put Jun Moriwaki as head Katamari game designer.  They released Me and My Katamari on the PSP in 2005/2006, which was god awful.  How can you have a Katamari game without analog sticks?</p><p>In 2007, Namco and Jun Moriwaki released Beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, the true sequel to We Love Katamari.  Unfortunately, Beautiful Katamari was uninspired and felt incredibly empty.  It suffered from numerous principle problems (<a href="/old/v7/beautiful-katamari-impressions" title="/beautiful-katamari-impressions">thoughts from Oct 23 2007</a>), but in its core, it was Katamari (<a href="/old/v7/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts" title="/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts">thoughts from Oct 24 2007</a>).  With the unoriginal story, horrible loading times, and $12 worth of DLC to make the game complete, Takahashi's original gameplay concept will always shine through.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever</b></div><p>2 weeks ago, on the 5 year Anniversary of Katamari Damacy (in the US), Namco released Katamari Forever, the newest Katamari game.  Even though, it's a "new" game, Katamari Forever is a compilation of "greatest hits" of the Katamari franchise.  It's chiefly comprised of levels from Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari.  It has 3 new levels that are unique to Katamari Forever.</p><p>It's strange that they completely ignored levels from Me and My Katamari.  Though, I never really played it because it was too difficult to control.  Maybe all those levels were from We Love Katamari?</p><p>Even though, they're the same levels, Katamari Forever has given them a modern treatment:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>All these levels have been upscaled to full 1080p.  Once you complete the level, you have your choice of 4 separate graphical representations of the level:  Cell-shaded, Wood-grain, Comic Book, and Classic.  I like the new Cell-shaded approach.  All the objects in the environment are clearly visible.</li><br/>	<li>Loading each level is lightning fast and takes 5 seconds at the most.  Unlike We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari, there is absolutely no loading at all during the level, which there shouldn't have been to begin with.</li><br/>	<li>In previous games, when you grew to the next size, the smaller objects would "pop out" of the environment to keep a reasonable amount of objects on screen at once.  With the optimized power of modern hardware, these smaller objects stick around for a little while longer.</li><br/></ul><br/>Katamari Forever has also added 2 new elements of gameplay, which are rather helpful:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>You can jump!  Though, it's a real pain in the ass to use the Sixaxis controls to jump, you can just use the R2 button instead.  It's really handy for getting to places you couldn't previously</li><br/>	<li>Throughout the level, you might find a heart.  There are broken hearts and full hearts.  When you roll one up it will suck up surrounding objects into your Katamari.  In practice, it's much less broken than that sounds.</li><br/></ul><br/>If you don't like these new features, you can roll in "Classic" mode which removes all hearts from the level, and removes jumping.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever Levels</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari, and Beautiful Katamari each have about 20 or so levels.  Katamari Forever took its levels from that bank of 60, and has a total of 34 levels.  Here's the list of levels you'll find in Katamari Forever</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RoboKing's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Tutorial</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star 1 - Playtime</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Delightful Dirigible)<br/><b>Make a Star 2 - Calories</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Munchies Manor)<br/><b>Make a Star 3 - Rich</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Lady Luck Casino)<br/><b>Make a Star 4 - Constellations</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Hubble Horoscope)<br/><b>Make a Star 5 - Underwater</b> (We Love Katamari - Inner Tube Guy - Underwater Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 6 - Animals</b> (We Love Katamari - Tan Dog - Friend Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 7 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 4)<br/><b>Make a Star 8 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Old Guy - As Large As Possible 3)<br/><b>Make a Star 9 - Energy</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dynaville)<br/><b>Make a Star 10 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 8)<br/><b>Make a Star 11 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Bird/Elephant As Large as Possible 5)<br/><b>Make the Moon</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make the Moon)<br/><b>Katamari Sprinkler</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star - Race</b> (We Love Katamari - Racecar Guy - Racetrack Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star - Danger</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dangerous Colony)<br/><b>Farewell!</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The King's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Gingerbread House</b> (We Love Katamari - Hansel &amp; Gretel - Candy Stage)<br/><b>Clean Up</b> (We Love Katamari - Cleaning Lady - 100 Objects Stage)<br/><b>Cows and Bears</b> (We Love Katamari - Cow/Bear guy - Cow/Bear Stage)<br/><b>Money</b> (We Love Katamari - "Save the Pandas" Guy - Money Stage)<br/><b>Fireflies</b> (We Love Katamari - Studying Guy - Firefly Stage)<br/><b>Sumo</b> (We Love Katamari - Mini Sumo - Sumo Stage)<br/><b>Shopping</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Fancy &amp; Schmancy)<br/><b>School</b> (We Love Katamari - Teacher - School Stage)<br/><b>Camp</b> (We Love Katamari - Campfire Guy - Fireball Stage)<br/><b>Limited to 50</b> (We Love Katamari - Baby - 50 Item Limit Stage)<br/><b>Snowman</b> (We Love Katamari - Snow Guy - Snowman Stage)<br/><b>Hot Stuff</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Roller Roaster)<br/><b>Small Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Small Just-right)<br/><b>Medium Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Medium Just-right)<br/><b>Large Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Large Just-right)<br/><b>Wake up the King</b> (Beautfiul Katamari - Schloss Kosmos)<br/><b>The King's Dream</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p>Katamari Forever has the unique variety of challenges found in We Love Katamari and, to a lesser extent, Beautiful Katamari, along with the growing scale found throughout all the games in the series.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scale is very scattered.  There's no sense of starting off small and eventually growing large from level to level.  By the time you've gotten to "Make a Star 7", which is The House from Katamari Damacy, the first level where you're big enough to roll up humans, you've already rolled up cars in "Cows and Bears" and horses in "Constellations".  Katamari Forever doesn't start building up scale a few levels after that.</p><p>I remember the first time in Katamari Damacy when I rolled up that little girl in The House.  In each level before that, you could roll up small animals, but the game made a point of making humans just a little bit too large for you to capture.  It wasn't until you completed The House, and rolled large enough afterward that you could envelope that girl.  It really made you work for it.  In the next level, you had to work at it again.  This time you could roll up adults, if you made it well past the level's goal.</p><p>Besides being inconsistent, New-comers to the Katamari series will have no concept of this at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Though, this game is really made for the fans.  Most of the best levels from the 3 core games of the franchise are in one spot.  They play and look better than they ever have before, so I can't complain too much.  I no longer have to wait through horrible load times in We Love Katamari or Beautiful Katamari...  I can pop in Katamari Forever and roll away pretty quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a week of playing, I've almost unlocked everything.  Playing these level for a second time is pretty fun, but I've already played them to death in their original games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Katamari Damacy Fanart" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/katamari-damacy-fanart">Katamari Damacy Fanart</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>5 years ago (yesterday), Namco released Katamari Damacy on PlayStation 2 at a mere $20.  They weren't sure how well it would sell in the states, so they gave it a reduced "budget" price, and let the market take its course.  Sales were slow, but word of mouth spread quickly, and fastly became a cult classic.  In fact, the Katamari Damacy franchise is one of my favorite video games to date.</p><p>I don't think there's any game released in the last 5 years that's as upbeat and quirky as Katamari.  A smile comes across my face every time I start a game.  It's a very zen-like experience to roll around the world and pick up whatever you can.</p><p>There has seen been 4 sequels to Katamari Damacy.  We Love Katamari is the PlayStation 2 follow-up released 1 year later, which polished gameplay and graphics, added variety, and has become the definite Katamari title.  After We Love Katamari, creator <b>Keita Takahashi</b> said he was done with the franchise and started working on new stuff.  That didn't stop Namco, which released a PSP game and then an Xbox 360 game.  Both of which were rather lack luster.</p><p>Yesterday, on the 5th anniversary of Katamari in the US, Katamari finally returns home to the PlayStation console in Katamari Forever on PlayStation 3.  Katamari Forever is part compliation, part remix, and upscale of all the previous releases.  I think they said it was 10% or 20% new material, but it's all these levels in one disc!  Plus, all the levels run in 1080p.  Also, you can change the graphical representation of the levels with separate skins and models.</p><p>I'm a huge fan of Katamari, so it's already purchased and in the mail.  To commemorate the new release, here's my favorite pieces of Katamari fanart I've collected over the past 5 years.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Damashy</b></div><p>by Oekaki Pocket</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp"  /></p><p>After the release of Katamari Damacy in 2004, I came across this picture on the internet.  Katamari's graphics are rather abstract, so it was interesting seeing a realistic approach to what a Katamari ball might actually look like.  When I was doing the Katamari Tshirt design for <a href="http://spamm.org" title="http://spamm.org">SPAMM</a>, I modeled some of my object after this picture.</p><p>I found the Oekaki Pocket website, but I was unable to find a larger version of the picture.  He just has a bunch of loli drawings and sketches on his site now.  Here's the link: <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oekaki/pocket/opo/pocket.html" title="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oekaki/pocket/opo/pocket.html">Oekaki Pocket: Scribble Works Gallery</a></p><div class='title'><b>Papercraft Prince</b></div><p>by Yuuku</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp"  /></p><p>Papercraft was becoming rather popular with nerdy folks on the Internet around 2004 and 2005, so a papercraft version of The Prince became widely linked picture very quickly.  In Fall 2005, when carving a Katamari pumpkin, I finally printed, cut out, and glued together a papercraft Prince of my own, which has migrated from several computer monitors since.</p><p>Here's the original site for the papercraft Prince: <a href="http://fccafe.fc2web.com/ptamacy.html" title="http://fccafe.fc2web.com/ptamacy.html">å¡?é­?ï¼?ç??å­ï¼?ã®ã??ã?¼ã??ã?¼ã?¯ã?©ã??ã??</a> (Katamari Damacy Prince Papercraft)</p><div class='title'><b>"Auto Wash"</b></div><p>by Mac Hall</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp"  /></p><p>Many webcomics latched onto Katamari Damacy, the same way fan artists did.  I like the Mac Hall entry the best mainly for the art.  Mac Hall is a pretty damn good artist, and his comic doesn't overly shove the comedy of the game in your face that way almost every other comic did.  It's subtle and clean.</p><p>Here's the link to the original: <a href="http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2005-02-21" title="http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2005-02-21">MacHall - Feb 21st, 2005</a></p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Otaku Planet</b></div><p>by Sudori</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp"  /></p><p>Otaku Planet is a much better rendition of the "roll of anime shit" idea that I used for the SPAMM shirt.  The fun thing about Katamari fanart is the amount of detail and references put into the stuff already rolled up into the ball.  You can stare at the thing for a while and continue to pick out new stuff.  Otaku Planet is just that.  Pikachu, Sailor Moon, Rurouni Kenshin, Naruto, Bleach, Domo-kun, Full Metal Alchemist, Card Captor Sakura, Totoro, CLAMP, Final Fantasy, so on and so on...</p><p>Here's the link to Sudori's DeviantArt page: <a href="http://sudoru.deviantart.com/art/katamari-otaku-planet-35539619" title="http://sudoru.deviantart.com/art/katamari-otaku-planet-35539619">DeviantArt - Sudori</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Colossal Katamari</b></div><p>by Snake</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp"  /></p><p>Shadow of the Colossus is another cult classic Playstation 2 game that was released within the same month as the second Katamari game, We Love Katamari.

| September 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Like Seasons 2 and 3, the first episode of the new Season of Dexter was leaked to the Internet just a few weeks before its premiere.  It's almost like it's intentional.  It definitely seemed intentional with Seasons 2 and 3.  The quality of the DivX file was superb.  The file I have of Season 4 episode 1 is pretty crappy, so I don't think it was intentional this time.  But who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Where we've been</b></div><p>Dexter is a pretty great show.  Season 1 was an amazing introduction to Dexter.  It displayed Dexter's thoughts and reasoning.  The emergence of a rival serial killer offered mystery, and eventually unraveled into a mirror of himself, his past, and his future.</p><p>Season 2 lost the mystery, but masked it with constant suspense.  Season 2 builds on all the character development from the previous season and demonstrates how well rounded the characters and cast are.  Unfortunately, it is a shallow experience compared to the first Season.</p><p>The typecast, thin representation of the Dexter cast really shows its colors in Season 3.  Season 3 settles down the suspense and mystery and adds character plot after character plot.  Dexter starts to lose spotlight, and Debra, Angel, and Laguerta become essential characters.  I think the writers and producers have become to comfortable with their jobs after Dexter was renewed up through Season 5 given the success of Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>The acting and writing has become very much like a sitcom.  Each actor has their character and always operates in these roles.  The only person that brings any personality to their character is Michael C. Hall with Dexter, which is ironic as he plays an emotionally distanced character.  It's gotten so transparent that it's difficult to watch.</p><p>I'd stop watching the show if I wasn't so invested in these characters.  Plus, I hold hope that Dexter will eventually recapture what made Season 1 so fantastic.  But I think they've completely run Dexter's character dry for story.  Maybe that's why the other characters have become so prevalent.</p><p>Season 3 is a stain in this series and takes it further away from what made it great.  Though, after watching the first episode of Season 4 that gleaming shimmer of hope flickers in my eye.</p><div class='title'><b>New Beginnings</b></div><p>Once the news broke that <b>John Lithgow</b> was the villian in Season 4, I was immediately excited.  Finally, a REAL actor in this dying show.  Michael C. Hall is a pretty good actor, but his range is not nearly as vast as Lithgow.  I was excited to see what they had in store.  Plus, there hasn't been a serial killer villain worth his weight since Season 1.</p><p>Rudy (or whomever) was the perfect villain for Season 1.  But Season 2 and 3?  Technically both seasons had its share of minor villains that Dexter had to vex in order to come out on top.  The story was spread and became weak as a result.  Aside from John Lithgow, Season 4's focus of a single villain should make the story much tighter.</p><div class='title'><b>Or is it..?</b></div><p>Unfortunately, with all these characters and stories of their own, I feel that the serial killing aspect of the show will become less and less important.  The writers seem to care more about the supporting cast and Dexter's home life than what the show was about to begin with.</p><p>Dexter always killed people as an outward expression of dealing with his problems.  It helped him work shit out.  But now, it just seems like he would be better off if he didn't.  His problems are the result of his serial killing.  So give it up!  Dexter already proved that this is not an addiction, so why is he still killing if it's screwing things up?</p><div class='title'><b>Ramble Ramble</b></div><p>Even though I'm pretty negative about the show, I'm still optimistic that Season 4 will turn out alright.  I don't see how it could be worse than Season 3, but the writers have a knack for throwing ridiculous plot points into the mix (SPOILER: such as the end of this first episode), so who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Dexter Season 4 begins this weekend on Showtime!</b></div><p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Motivation to Run" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/motivation-to-run">Motivation to Run</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I finished around the same time as previously, but just a little bit quicker.  In the Madison Half Marathon, I finished at 2 hours 50 minutes, but it was probably closer to <b>2 hours 48 minutes</b>, as it took 2 minutes to cross the starting line.  I finished the Madison Mini Marathon is <b>2 hours 45 minutes</b>.  And today, I finished the Fox Cities Marathon is <b>2 hours 43 minutes</b>.</p><p>After finishing my first Half Marathon, I wrote about why I <a href="/old/v7/run-run-run" title="/run-run-run">decided to Run</a>. Spoiler! I saw the movie, Run Fatboy Run, and thought it looked pretty easy.  And it wasn't too difficult.  That first half marathon beat the shit out of me, but it gave me perspective and motivation for fitness.</p><div class='title'><b>Motivation</b></div><p>Motivation is the reason I signed up for another 2 Half Marathon right after finishing the first.  Motivation to continue running on my own and exercise regularly.  Overall, I run to lose weight and keep fit.  I like to be light on my feet.  But running builds Motivation of its own.  The energy spent and built while running keeps the body in motion throughout the day.  It eases my lazy tendencies and lightens my mood.  The cycle of exercise and motivation to exercise is just as powerful as the cycle to sit there and not exercise.</p><p>During a marathon, that motivation is far greater because you're surrounded by thousands of other people that have the motivation to get out of bed on very early weekend morning and run for a few hours as the sunrises.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" /></p><p>Everyone is there for different reasons, but those reasons give them the same motivation that guides their feat across the pavement and eventually across the finish line.  And at the finish line you're given a medal for you hard work.  There are few exercises that will award with a medal on top of the health, fitness and perpetual motivation.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>The daylight continues to escape the skies, the leaves have started to wither and rot, and the temperature is declining.  Fall is here and my weekends are rather busy, so I don't have the time to take in any more half marathons this year.  Though, I will probably do Gilda's Run on October 24th in Middleton, which is 5 miles.</p><p>I've been looking at Half Marathon dates next year and have a couple that look like fun.</p><p>Feb 28th // Gasparilla Half Marathon in Tampa, Florida<br/>May 1st // Door County Half Marathon in Pennisula Park, Wisconsin<br/>May 1st // Wisconsin Half Marathon is Kenosha, Wisconsin (one or the other, not both)<br/>May 30th // Madison Half Marathon in Madison, Wisconsin<br/>Jun 6th // Minneapolis Half Marathon in Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>Hopefully, that Florida Half Marathon will keep me running over the next 5 months.  I started "training" back in March this year, so the cold shouldn't keep me away.  Though, huge gaping breaths in cold tempatures could probably screw up my throat.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: SWAG and Purchases" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-swag-and-purchases">PAX 09: SWAG and Purchases</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Since the announcement of Star Wars The Old Republic and their lofty plans for a story-driven nature in an MMO, I was definitely intrigued and ready to purchase to see just how they planned on accomplishing that.  Though, Star Wars fan were more excited about the idea of a new Star Wars MMORPG that would probably not suck.</p><p>Star Trek fans had the same excitement early last year when Cryptic Studios announced <b>Star Trek Online</b>.  Cryptic Studios have been responsible for City of Heroes/Villains, a super hero oriented MMORPG that they sold to NCSoft after acquiring the Marvel MMO rights.  Unfortunately Marvel fell through, and they changed the game to Champions Online to directly compete with their previous MMO.</p><p>Cryptic had many demo stations of the recently released Champions Online, but reserved a couple units for Star Trek Online which Five gave a try.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Star Trek Canon</b></div><p>Between Star Wars and Star Trek, I'm totally a fan of Star Trek.  I watched Star Trek The Next Generation every night before going to bed in High School.  I've seen all the movies, watched almost all of Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  So, while Five tried to figure out the annoying controls, I talked with a demonstrator about the canon of Star Trek in Star Trek Online.</p><p><b>Me</b>: What time period does Star Trek Online cover?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Star Trek Online takes place 30 years after the destruction of Romulus.  If you've seen the most recent Star Trek film, the Murauder and future Spock had journeyed back in time because of those events.  So, Star Trek Online takes place further in time than any Star Trek series or movie.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Can you play as any Star Trek race?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, you can play as any race that has ever appeared in any Star Trek series or movie.  In fact, you can make up your own race if you'd like.</p><p><b>Me</b>: That's weird...</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Weird?!  We at Cryptic think it's pretty cool.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Are there different factions or something?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, in Star Trek Online, you can choose between the Federation and Klingon.  In the Star Trek timeline, the destruction of Romulus cast doubt in the Klingon high council that the Federation had any idea of what they were doing.  Harsh words were spoken, and the Klingon broke off from the Federation.  Many of the events in Star Trek Online focus on that conflict and you can choose your sides.</p><p><b>Me</b>: So, if you're Federation, you just fight Klingons?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Absolutely not, Star Trek Online goes into all the conflicts with a wide range of Alien races throughout the Star Trek Universe.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Okey Dokey, sounds like fun ^_^</p><p><b>Me thinking</b>: eh, not really.</p><div class='title'><b>Combat</b></div><p>The demo focused completely on Combat.  That's all you really do in an MMO anyways.  Five commanded an Away on a planet's surface and started fighting some Klingons.  The Klingons were pretty weak though :/  This was pretty boring, so he beamed back to the ship and warped to another planet.</p><p>While orbiting another planet, Klingons appeared!  What strife!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp"  /></p><p>Space combat is pretty interesting and much more involved than clicking on dudes and beating them down with swords or phasers.  Those circular bars around your ship indicate the strength of your shields in those areas.  Depending on where you're taking fire, only those shields will be affected.  So, if you start taking a lot of damage in the rear, you should turn around and take damage from the side or front to even it out.</p><p>Much like every combat in a recent Star Trek, you can totally change the amount of energy put into the shields, or life support, or weapons on the fly!  "Full power to forward weapons!"  That's another thing, depending on the direction you're facing you can only fire aft torpedoes or forward phasers.  It's pretty damn sweet how they integrated very fundamental concepts from Space Battles in the movies or series into the game.</p><p>That being said, it's incredibly annoying to keep everything straight.  At least, it was in the first 5 minutes of the fight.  The races you choose also have an effect on evasive maneuvers and other things.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This game is pretty stupid.  I don't really see any point to it at all unless you're an absolute fan of Star Trek.  Creating your own race would be fun to fill in the gaps that Cryptic missed, but overall it's just a level grind.  The story sounds boring as crap with scrolling text relaying anything important.  I'm not going to pay attention to that.</p><p>The Space Combat was kinda neat though, but that's the only positive I got from the demo and it's really only a novelty to recreate battles from episode of Next Generation.</p><p>Star Trek Online releases for the PC sometime next year, if not 2011.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Split Second Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-split-second-hands-on">PAX 09: Split Second Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While in Seattle, I stayed with some of my college friends, Ace and Jess.  Returning home on Saturday, Ace asked a pretty important question regarding the nature of PAX.  <b>Were there any games you saw or played that you had no intention of buying until after you saw or played them?</b> Every company exhibiting games at PAX was there for the sole purpose of selling their game.  They weren't there for fun.</p><p>This has happened a couple times in the past.  In 2007, after seeing Mass Effect in action, I was sold.  Last year, Castle Crashers completely changed my mind and I bought it on the spot.</p><p>This year, that game would have to be Split Second.  Though, I wouldn't say it put me in a buying mood.  It definitely caught my eye and I totally want to play more of it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Racing!</b></div><p><b>Split Second</b> is a racing game, but has some elements that reminds me of the Burnout series.  In your effort to finish first, you can knock out your opponents by causing explosions and considerably changing the environment of the racetrack.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp"  /></p><p>Throughout the race you build up that blue/red meter underneath your car.  It'll build up fast when you knock out opponents, catch some air, drift around corners, and any other fancy driving.  As the Blue meter fills up, icons will flicker in the surrounding environments when you can cause explosions to take out your opponents.</p><p>Once you fill two Blue meters, the third meter is Red.  Once the red meter is complete full, you can cause some serious explosions.  Like blowing up the flight control tower and crash it onto the race track.  Or blow up the road underneath your opponents exposing an underground promenade.  Or summon a 747 airliner crashing while trying to land on the runway.</p><p>The environmental effects of a Red explosion are huge and cause the landscape of the racetrack to change.  When you blow up the control tower, it blocks the track and racers need to go through hangers.  When you blow up road, you fall into a lower version of the track.  The changes create shortcuts, and more difficult areas.</p><p>Also, all the racers can blow up shit in the environment, not just you.  Things are blowing up all over the place once the computers think you're winning too much.</p><div class='title'><b>No HUD</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp"  /></p><p>One other very interesting thing about Split Second is the absence of a HUD (or Heads-up User Display).  There's no information on the corners of the screen.  As you can see from the screen shot, the place, laps, and explosion bar are tapered on the back of your car, which gives a very different driving experience than any other racer out there.</p><p>It's actually a pretty smart move since you need to pay attention to the environment around you, just as much as the cars in front of you.  The HUD would just get in the way.  And now you can see everything quite clearly.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Split Second is brought to you by Black Rock Studio, whose previous titles include Moto GP, Pure, and Hot Wheels Stunt Track.  Their past includes all racing games, but none of which have really made a name for them.  Split Second is definitely different, but could get repetitive very fast.</p><p>It was announced earlier this year, and should be release sometime in 2010.  Even though, it surprised me and I played it several times throughout the weekend, I don't plan on buying it.  It'll be at the top of my GameFly list, but I am skeptical the amount of enjoyment I'll get out of Split Second after playing it for 2 or 3 weeks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-the-brodeo-live-reunion">PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One year ago in two weeks, my favorite podcast recorded it's final episode, and did not return to the Internet.  The Brodeo starred 1up staffers Sean Malloy, Ryan Scott, Sean Elliot, Jeff Green, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.  On September 11th, 2008, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and on September 18th, Sean Elliot did the same.  I wrote a little bit about it on that day: <a href="/old/v7/the-brodeo-is-over" title="/the-brodeo-is-over">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=491</a>.</p><p>It was my favorite because they had the perfect blend of serious game discussion and deconstruction, mixed with clever humor and ridiculous bizarre stories.  Jeff Green spoke very candidly and honestly about his life and thoughts on games.  Shawn Eliott would regale ridiculous stories from the past, while going into depth about ideas and game design.  Robert Ashley would provide great commentary and further insight into the conversation.  Ryan Scott...  wouldn't say much.  Anthony Gallegos was a goof ball.</p><p>This round table always made the conversation revolve in the right direction that was entertaining and thought provoking.  If you haven't listened to GFW Radio, definitely check out all the previous episodes.  Yes, it's a PC podcast, but PC gaming is a very small component of what makes the podcast so great.  All the podcasts are still hosted at 1up.com's <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397">GFW podcast page</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>The Fans</b></div><p>Being at The Brodeo reunion was a reunion for everyone in the room.  It wasn't just a reunion for the Brodeo members, but all the fans, too.  All the fans listened, laughed, and thought in unison while The Brodeo talked about Diapered Anime fans, working in Game Development, playing games no longer being Journalists, Smoking poop, and the Truth behind GFW Magazine's end.</p><p>The Brodeo crew have a very unique voice, but the fans really bring out the best in them.  In fact, it was fan Aaron Simmer who contacted all the Brodeo members, raised money to fly them to PAX, created the Panel, reserved the room, and organized the entire event for them.  It was Bill Mudron who created this excellent Graphic for the reunion, printed out 200 poster sized copies, and sold them at the Panel for $2 to cover the cost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp"  /></p><p>(I was able to get all 5 Brodeo member signatures on my poster, too!)</p><p>And it was all the fans that showed up and gave their attention, their laughter and their questions that brought out the familiarity and comfort of being with like minds and friends.</p><div class='title'><b>The Reunion</b></div><p>Much like every episode of The Brodeo, they talked well past their allotted 1 hour mark.  And continued for an entire 2 hours and 15 minutes, complete with questions.  You can find video of the entire event on Game Videos (<a href="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/26295" title="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/26295">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/26294" title="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/26294">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/26293" title="http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/26293">Part 3</a>).
