| November 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Night, Leif and I traveled to The Rave in Milwaukee for MSTRKRFT.  MSTRKRFT were pretty damn amazing, and La Doche Vita were pretty awesome, too.  But, The Rave is a fucking pit.  A dank disgusting disease ridden shithole that I will genuinely need to reconsider visiting.</p><div class='title'><b>Electro and Youth</b></div><p>It was pretty great seeing a vast amount of actual electronic music fans at this event.  The past couple times that I've been to The Rave definitely had fans of the music, but it really wasn't Milwaukee's scene.  Milwaukee has greater roots in Metal and Punk, rather than a bunch of raver kids.  Minneapolis and Chicago are the real hubs around here for that kind of music.  Maybe that scene traveled from somewhere else into Milwaukee tonight for MSTRKRFT?</p><p>Though, additionally, MSTRKRFT and Electro House music generally garners a different crowd than the music that introduced me into Electronica.  The Electro House genre is pretty new and is still exploding with new talent every year.  With its arrival brings a new generation of kids into the electronic music sub-genre and sparks it with the energy of youth.  The general age of the crowd was kinda young.  Much younger than the crowd for <a href="/old/v7/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee" title="/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method</a> a couple months ago.</p><p>That endless amount of youthful energy feeds from the powerful charge of Electro.</p><div class='title'><b>MSTRKRFT</b></div><p>These guys continue to push and develop the genre how they see fit.  MSTRKRFT are the ones basically writing the definition of Electro House.  It's amazing how most other Electro DJs follow in their footsteps, but are still one or two steps behind.  MSTRKRFT keep a distinct sound for themselves that completely sets them apart from the rest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp"  /></p><p>I was confused about when they were going to perform.  When we arrived, it looked like JFK (Jesse F. Keeler of MSTRKRFT) was already up on stage with another dude..  Once they finished, and after La Doche Vita performed, fucking DJ Funk took the stage and completely ruined the vibe.  Is DJ Funk a legitimate DJ?  or a mock DJ?  I couldn't tell if it was a joke..  Leif and I left the room and went to the other area with some locals spinnin' songs.  After a little while, we checked the main room again, and they were on stage, huzzah.</p><p>It was pretty incredible.  I'm not very current on Electro at all, but when it's on, it's on.  They played some amazing songs including one of my favorites, "D.A.N.C.E" by Justice, which I captured some on video..</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>La Doche Vita</b></div><p>Right before DJ Funk nearly ruined the evening, La Doche Vita performed a pretty great set themselves.  They mentioned they're originally from Milwaukee, but got their start down in Chicago.  They are a very young duo having only formed in 2008, but since then, have made some incredible remixes of The Faint, The Prodigy, Femme Fatality..  They have a couple of these remixes available on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita" title="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita">MySpace page</a>.</p><p>Their set consisted heavily of these types of remixes.  Leif was able to pick out Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, The Prodigy..  One of my favorite songs of the night was a remix of The Prodigy's "Smack my Bitch up" set against Deadmau5's "Ghosts 'n Stuff".  I got some video of that, too...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8XDdili0iPc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8XDdili0iPc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I'm pretty sure they were dead-set on playing that song when they noticed one of the dudes in the crowd wearing the Deadmau5 mask.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5812.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5785.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5776.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Rave</b></div><p>For the past couple of years now, living in Madison and visiting Minneapolis and Chicago regularly, it's been incredibly pleasant thanks to the Smoking Ban.  Cigarette smoke had never bothered me to the point of rioting, but it's subtle benefits are great.  My clothes aren't disgusting the next day and the air inside those bars and clubs are quite clean and occasionally refreshing.</p><p>The Smoking Ban has been yet to extend itself to Milwaukee, or at least this part of Milwaukee.  It's never been a problem for me before.  But my throat has been screwed up from food poisoning earlier this week and hadn't fully healed, yet.  Obviously yelling really loud wasn't a good idea, but with everyone smoking as if they needed it to live,  the polluted air was extra damaging.  My voice is pretty screwed up today.</p><p>Also, on the way home, I started feeling some pain in my left eye.  It was really annoying, and made me tear profusely.  It wasn't particular painful.  It just felt like something was stuck in my eye.  When I got home, my eye was a little puffy.  That's happened before..  nothing new there.  I just went to bed.  This morning my eye was inflamed.  It had fuse shut with all the gunk it excreted throughout the night.  It looked pretty gross.  A quick search of the symptoms and yep, I have pink eye.</p><p>How the hell do you get Pink Eye from going to a concert?  Especially when I hadn't touched a single thing inside the place at all.  Some website mentioned "sensitivity to light" being a cause.  Could a constant bright strobe light pointed at my face cause my eye to burst out in Pink Eye?  I've been going to clubs and concerts for years with like setups, and this has never happened.</p><p>Fucking diseased, smoke ridden venue...  Never again!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Goroawase 語呂合わせ" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/goroawase">Goroawase 語呂合わせ</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, at work, I was talking with one of the project managers about the Konami Code.  We have <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/" title="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/">Flex Spy</a> setup in our Flex App, but we only want Users logged into the omni-user account to use it, and even then, we don't want it displayed at inappropriate times.  Why not implement the Konami Code?  When an omni-user keys in the code while using our app, it'll appear!</p><p>I think everyone in my age group knows what the Konami Code is, but might not necessarily know it by name.  This code showed up in almost all of Konami's arcade style games starting with the NES in the late 80s up through today.  The Konami Code is as follows...</p><p>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start.</p><p>I sent the project manager a link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Wikipedia Page</a>.  After glancing over the article real quick, I noticed a little piece of information that solved a mystery that sat around in my head for years and years.</p><p><em>In Mobile phone games by Konami, B A are substituted with 5 7 3 on the numerical pad, which is the goroawase pronunciation for "konami."</em></p><p>573!  I have seen that number all over the place in Konami games.  I first noticed this when I saw that every single Konami Arcade game has a default high score of 57300.  I had no idea why that was significant, but it was consistent.</p><div class='title'><b>Goroawase</b></div><p>Goroawase uses the native Japanese reading (kun'yomi), the Japanese approximation of Chinese reading (on'yomi), and the English reading to describe a word in the form of a number.  The Wiki page has a wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">chart</a> showing each reading for each number.</p><p>The normal reading of 573 in Japanese is "go-shichi-san".  For 7 and 3, we want to use the native Japanese pronunciation, so it would be "go-nana-mitsu".  If we use the base kana for "go", and just the first syllables of 7 and 3, we get "ko-na-mi".</p><p>This is used in various places throughout gaming.  In Dance Dance Revolution, there's a Song called ".59".  In Japanese, the period is pronounced 'ten'.  So with that, the reading would be "Ten-go-ku", which translates as "Heaven" in English.  You might also know Japanese Video Game Designer, Suda Goichi, who writes his name Suda 51.  His name gets mispronounced all the time in the states as Suda Fifty-One.</p><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">Wiki Article</a> has a couple more examples that are interesting ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Happy Carl Sagan Day!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/happy-carl-sagan-day">Happy Carl Sagan Day!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Happy <a href="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/">Carl Sagan Day</a> everyone!  Today is the first annual celebration of the life of Carl Sagan, the great astronomer, author and philosopher.  75 years ago, he was brought into this world and his inspiration and passion has inspired and affected us all.  Carl Sagan passed away in 1996, but his legacy lives on in those he inspired, especially in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Contact</b></div><p>I think a lot of people's first encounter with Carl Sagan was the movie Contact, at least, for those not actively participating in the field of astronomy or philosophy.  Contact is a film released in 1997 staring Jodie Foster and teen hunk Matthew McConaughey.  It's based on the Science-Fiction novel, written by Carl Sagan.  It was my introduction to his philosophy and interest towards god and extraterrestrial life.  I really liked Contact, but it didn't inspire me to look into the concepts any further.  It was a piece of Science Fiction, and I basically treated it that way.</p><p>I haven't read Contact the novel, but I have the feeling that the story and SciFi aspects prominently displayed in the movie were really just a vehicle to talk about the greater concepts.  The possibility of technological advanced life in our universe, and whether the belief of a higher power is truly representative of our species.</p><div class='title'><b>A Glorious Dawn</b></div><p>It wasn't until recently that I became a big fan on Carl Sagan.  Like usual, it was something on the Internet that inspired and peaked my interest.  2 months ago, on September 17th, 2009, mild mannered John Boswell, released an auto-tuned music video of the Internet composed of quotes and clips from Carl Sagan's award-winning 1980 TV series Cosmos.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zSgiXGELjbc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zSgiXGELjbc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>After listening to A Glorious Dawn, I could not get it out of my head.  It had infected me with its soft low key melody and powerful important message.  I must've listened to this song several hundred times already.  I downloaded the mp3, I downloaded the mpeg video.</p><p>Since the debut of Glorious Dawn on YouTube is has become the #1 highest rated video of all time.  It has become so popular that Boswell started the <b>Symphony of Science</b>, a musical project to bring the thoughts and works of the greatest scientific minds of our lifetime into song and inspire the world to care about Science!</p><p>Additionally, for Carl Sagan Day, A Glorious Dawn will be released as a single through Third Man Records.  Side A will contain A Glorious Dawn, and Side B will contain a reproduction of the contents of the golden record encased in the Voyager space probes launched from earth in the late 70s!  You can get that here: <a href="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html" title="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html">Third Man Records</a>.

If we do not destory ourselves, we'll one day venture to the stars."</em></p><p><em>"The Cosmos is full behind measure of elegant truths of the exquisite interrelationships of the awesome machinery of nature."</em></p><p><em>"The simplest thought like the concept of the number one has an elaborate logical underpinning."</em></p><p>Carl Sagan has an extraordinary talent of talking about incredibly large and complex topics in a very straight forward, direct, easy-to-understand manor.  It just so happens that entire series of Cosmos is available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos" title="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos">Hulu</a>.  Over the course of a week or two, I watched the entire show, while playing Katamari Forever.</p><p>Cosmos was originally made in 1980.  All these episodes are the 1990 versions with updates included at the end of the episodes to talk about the advancements made in those 10 years relative the subject manor in each episode.</p><p>In many ways, Cosmos is Carl Sagan's message to us.  It's a message of fact explaining the universe and how it personally relates to us.  It's a message of passion demonstrating the magnitude of who and what we are.  It's a message of imagination challenging your mind to expand itself beyond your limitations.  And it's a message of love, so to speak, pleading with the world to end needless war.</p><p>It's an amazing 13 episode journey that is a display of earth's greatest scientific achievements.  Even though, it's almost 30 years old, the passionate, powerful message is timeless.. We are all one species..  We have evolved because of our nack of exploration, curiosity, imagination, and togetherness.  We must embrace each other and embark on the next journey of discovery.. to the stars.</p><p>If you haven't seen Cosmos, definitely check it out.  It's entirely online for free! ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Happy Carl Sagan Day!</b></div><p>Have a great day everyone!  Though, I'm somewhat confused as to which actual day Carl Sagan day is supposed to be.  <a href="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/">Carl Sagan Day dot Com</a> says it's supposed to be today on November 7th, the anniversary of his birth.  However, Wikipedia says his birthday is on the 9th.  That's also when the Glorious Dawn single is released..  Who knows..  Happy Carl Sagan weekend?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shipping Action Figures on eBay" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shipping-action-figures-on-ebay">Shipping Action Figures on eBay</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 2, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><a href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-2" title="/schlock-for-sale-2">A little over one year ago</a>, I took a long look at the excessive piles of stuff that plagued my apartment and my parent's house, and finally did something about it.  I bought an eBay store, and started listing VHS tapes, DVDs, Video Games, Music, Action Figures, and other things on Half.com and eBay.  Throughout the following months, it was incredibly successful.  There were weeks when I'd have as much as 5 packages to send out each day.  Things eventually died down, but there have been <a href="/old/v7/schlock-for-sale-restock" title="/schlock-for-sale-restock">restock days</a> every now and then.</p><p>Action figures have been the most annoying items to send because there really isn't a standard issue box to accomodate the variety of dimensions.  Some are taller, some are fatter, some are heavy, some are fragile.  Eventually, I came across a pretty effecient way to box them, and I'd like to share that with you.</p><div class='title'><b>How I box an action figure</b></div><p>For every action figure I sell, I create a completely custom box to ship it in.  In order to create a box from nothing, I needed some cardboard.  Cardboard is VERY easy to come by if you live in an apartment building that frequenty changes residents.  One day I found two HUGE U-haul boxes in the recycling bin, which have served me incredibly well.  I dragged those back to my apartment and stuffed them in our extra closet.  I've found some more boxes over the months, so they've begun to pile up...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Cutting</b></div><p>With the largest chunk of cardboard, I begin measuring the dimensions of the action figure on the box.  Though, usually, I just begin cutting with a box cutter.  The dimensions don't have to be exact because cardboard bends and shape very easily.  It's a great medium for builing sculptures. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp"  /></p><p>There's one piece cut.

Since Dave was in town on Friday, he and I went to try it out.</p><p>They certainly had a rather large selection of foods.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5511.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5512.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5513.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5517.webp"  /></p><p>They had crab legs, chicken teriyaki shish-kabobs, salmon, shrimp, tempura shrimp, tempura brocolli, tempura squash, kalamari, octopus, frog legs, prawns, oysters, and so on....</p><p>The salmon wasn't too bad, and the tempura shrimp and veggies were great.  I didn't try many other seafood selections, but I probably should have.  They had edamame there, too, but Dave informed me it was unsalted.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5514.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5515.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5516.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5516.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5516.webp"  /></p><p>The bulk of what I ate was their sushi.  It was pretty decent, though it wasn't gourmet by any means.  It tasted identical to the sushi you can find at Copps, actually.  They had plenty of sushi chefs on staff preparing it and putting it out immediately.  But again, the quality is nothing compared to what you'll find at Takumi or Sushi Muramoto.</p><p>They had plenty of Japanese beers, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_oysy/IMG_5519.webp"  /></p><p>Their buffet was the only food item on the menu, and for a $20 entry fee, the price is a little steep.  If you're going to dine for Japanese tonight, I would definitely recommend any other Japanese restaurant in Madison.  Takumi and Sushi Muramoto are absolutely delicious for Sushi, and Ginza and Takara are fantastic too with a more well-rounded menu.</p><p>I don't want to bash on the place because I love Japanese food and it's great to see a new restaurant open that isn't just Sushi or Teppanyaki and has more variety, but...  you can do better.</p><p>I really wish a Ramen restaurant would open in Madison or somewhere nearby.  The closest and only one I know of is in Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights, Chicago.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo @ House of Blues" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-hernan-cattaneo-house-of-blues-chicago">Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo @ House of Blues</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>October 2009 has been absolutely amazing.  The amount of talented musicians I've seen this month dwarf the entire year.  Seeing Moby Live for the first time was amazing, and John Digweed was incredibly powerful.  Dark Dark Dark came to town, and so did MC Chris along with his openers.  Each performance made me more and more excited for what was to end the month.  Sasha was returning to the midwest, and the day had finally arrived.</p><div class='title'><b>House of Blues</b></div><p>This was my first time to the House of Blues.  I've been to several clubs and venues in Chicago, but always manage to avoid the House of Blues somehow.  The House of Blues is somewhat close to Visions and Soundbar.  But unlike those clubs, House of Blues is more a venue.  It has an actual prominent stage that can be seen from almost anywhere in the place.  It's very easy to move around and talk with people too.</p><p>Being a venue, the people who attended the show were actual music fans.  It's quite a difference than the normal douchebag crowd you'd find at Visions.  It was rather refreshing.  Dave and I talked with a dude in the line about music while we waited.  And I talked with a few people inside too.  I'll certainly see some music nerds at Visions, but they are not as prominent as the rest of the club scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp"  /></p><p>Dave and I arrived at the House of Blues around 11pm and completely missed Chris Walsh and Wahi opening for Hernan Cattaneo.  This was my first time seeing him live.  And really, it was first time even listening to his music too.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_j_lEcpFlG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_j_lEcpFlG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>His sound was incredibly hard and deep.  It also echoed Electro to a degree.. but overall, very Tribal.  It was pretty damn amazing.  Though, I found it curious that he played at least 2 songs that Wahi played 3 weeks ago when Digweed was in town.  Hernan's tracks followed a somewhat predictable pattern, but that's not necessary a bad thing.  It made them more accessible and very easy to move to.  I definitely need to listen to this man some more. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp"  /></p><p>The tone of the atmosphere changed pretty quickly once Sasha got a hold of the decks.  The predictability went out the window.  And the sound became incredibly layered and ambient.  His selections were very organic.  The type of sound that fuses and shakes your body.  Like the rhythm of a heartbeat or the slapping of wooden instruments.</p><p>It was pretty amazing, too.  For a few years, I felt like I was drifting away from Sasha.  I felt like his sets were pretty solid and technically astounding, but lacked the variety that really made me a huge fan to begin with.  His set on this night felt like he was definitely returning to what made him an excellent DJ in the first place.</p><p>Mixing sounds that put him in a genre of his own, rather than simply Prog House.  It was all about layers.  Sounds building on other sounds.  Slowly building and slowly tearing down and slowly transitioning.  Like swimming in an ocean and letting the waves carry you to where ever...</p><p>Brilliant</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5rTbCHMOgsM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5rTbCHMOgsM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5582.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5598.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5614.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Wahi</b></div><p>It kinda sucks that we arrived too late to hear Wahi spin some songs, but hopefully he recorded what he did, so I can hear it later.

Thankfully, there wasn't a horrible ice storm of death, like last time.  It was actually really nice outside for a mid-October evening.</p><p>I'm not particularly a fan of Jonathon Coulton but I've actually seen him in concert a lot, which is somewhat weird.  I've seen him 6 times in the past 2 years.  Though, 3 of those were out of convenience of him performing at PAX.</p><p>Every time he comes through Madison, I buy a ticket and I wonder why.  I don't really like his music style and the crowd is usually packed with people that are WAY too into his music.  But, I still buy a ticket and attend the show.  And every time I'm glad that I did because I actually do enjoy myself.  It's pretty fun, and the show feels pretty unique, even though it's the same thing.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul &amp; Storm</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp"  /></p><p>Paul &amp; Storm have traditionally performed that exact same material every time I've seen them open for Coulton.  They start with Opening Band.  They sing the Nun song, the music tributes (the musician in this situation), the 15 second commercials, and end with Pirates.</p><p>Tonight, they actually performed new material and they didn't rely on the same formula of their past performances.  Here's their set list, which is a little out of order, and probably missing a song or two.</p><p>Paul and Storm - Theme Song<br/>The Way-Too-Early Christmas Song<br/>Frogger! The Frogger Musical<br/>Nun Fight<br/>Live<br/>Nugget Man<br/>If James Taylor were on Fire<br/>If Aaron Neville Were Waiting for a Parking Spot at the Mall, but Someone else Snagged it<br/>If They Might Be Giants were the Ice Cream Man<br/>Opening Band<br/>The Captain's Wife's Lament</p><p>Their Frogger song was pretty funny.  Starting off with new material gave their set of a fresh view for people that have seen them a couple times already.  When they sang their old stuff towards the end, it felt they were returning to the classics, rather than the same shit they sing every time.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp"  /></p><p>Like usual, the crowd couldn't stop yelling out random nonsense.  There was this girl behind us that couldn't help but yell in our ears as loud as she could.  There was some dude in the balcony that had a gasping, yelping laugh that was infectious at first, but annoying as shit after it continued for almost a minute straight.</p><p>Though, Paul &amp; Storm really feed off this crazy crowd.  They'll continue to respond to the random yelling and usually retort and continue the tangential cycle that keeps them from singing anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathon Coulton</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp"  /></p><p>Not too long after Paul &amp; Storm finished their set, Jonathon Coulton took the stage and immediately began his set, which is as follows...</p><p>1. ????<br/>2. Ikea<br/>3. Shop Vac<br/>4. Code Monkey<br/>5. I'm your Moon<br/>6. Curl<br/>7. Space Doggity<br/>8. "Dead" -They Might Be Giants<br/>9, Big Bad World One<br/>10. Creepy Doll<br/>11. Mr. Fancy Pants<br/>12. Drinking with You<br/>13. The Future Soon<br/>14. Skullcrusher Mountain<br/>15. Still Alive<br/>16. Mandelbrot Set<br/>17. You Ruined Everything<br/>18. Your Brains</p><p>1. A Talk with George<br/>2. First of May</p><p>Coulton certainly acts more mature than Paul &amp; Storm, so it felt rather awkward when the crowd would yell out random crap.  I guess Coulton didn't really care, but most of the nonsense he just ignored or attempted to cull.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp"  /></p><p>As I mentioned a few times, I'm not that big a fan of Coulton.  I've seen him 6 times live, but I've never actually listened to any of his music outside of a concert.  I've only heard the acoustic versions of anything he's done, except for Still Alive.  And every time he performs a song I've heard before, it's mostly identical to what I've heard before.</p><p>When I saw Moby perform earlier this year, his set was full of songs from his entire body of work, but each one was played in a new style, or brought something new to the table.  The concert was completely unique as it wasn't just a Live version of the song, but it was the 2009 Live version of the song.  Adding Paul &amp; Storm as background singers and percussion was a great addition, but maybe Coulton should bring something else or something more to his concerts to diversify.</p><p>It's great if you've never heard him before, but his past 3 performances in Madison are nearly identical.  I guess if you're a huge fan, you probably just want to hear the "classics" rather than some experimental evolution of his "classics".  I feel his songs have gone beyond the initial chuckle from the lyrics, and after that all you have is the underlying music, which I think is pretty standard.</p><p>He needs more experimental songs like Mr. Fancy Pants..</p><div class='title'><b>Coulton USB thingy</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp"  /></p><p>I mentioned that I've never bought or listened to any of Coulton's music before.  Well... that changed last night, as I purchased this Jonathon Coulton USB stick.  It's 2 gigs and contains ALL of his music, as well as, album art and source material for all the tracks of JoCo Looks Back (which is a CD of all his popular songs).  It was $50, which might seem like a lot, but, again, has all 9 or 10 CDs of his plus stuff he's posted on his blog.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Evangelion 1.0 in English!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/evangelion-10-in-english">Evangelion 1.0 in English!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In September 2007, Gainax and Studio Khara released the 1st of the Rebuild of Evangelion quadrilogy.  North American licensing will still up in the air, at this point.  Many Anime fans wondered if ADV could pick up the rights?  Perhaps Manga entertainment would paid a shitload of money for the previous movies?</p><div class='title'><b>When?</b></div><p>Over a year had passed after its theatrical release and STILL no American Anime company had bought the rights..  It had already been out on DVD in Japan since April, and there were no signs it was even coming to America until Funimation (of all Anime companies) issued a cease and desist order to fansubbers in November 2008.  It wasn't until December 31st, 2008 that they official stated they had the domestic rights.</p><p>One day in March 2009, with the anticipation of Evangelion 2.0, I finally decided to <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">download and watch Evangelion 1.0</a>.  <a href="/old/v7/rebuild-of-evangelion" title="/rebuild-of-evangelion">And it was fantastic.</a> ^_^  In May 2009, <a href="/old/v7/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone" title="/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">the Bluray</a> was finally released, and I bought it because I wanted to see the movie in absolute clarity.  Funimation, still dragging their feet, finally announced the voice cast around the same day the Bluray released in Japan.</p><p>In June 2009, Evangelion 2.0 was released in theaters and earned $5 million in 2 days showing on only 120 screens.  Each theater showing the movie earned about $40,000 for those 2 days. [<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen">link</a>]  It was so successful that Studio Khara now has a blank check for making the final 2 movies in the series.

Evangelion 1.0 has been complete since September, and they've been showing it in several theaters across the states, but it's doing terribly.  Their "theatrical" run has made a pathetic $100,000, so far. [<a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm" title="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm">link</a>]</p><p>There could be other reasons why Evangelion is under performing in the states, though.  For me, Evangelion is my Star Wars.  It's a cultural icon of my past and has influenced that way I have viewed Anime since then.  I think many Japanese people feel the same way, which is why it's such a huge success over there.  The shared experience of a generation of Anime fans, reuniting with the new generation.</p><p>It doesn't garner the same mass fandom over here, because Evangelion was released when Anime was still quite niche in America.  The kids in the know and super fans definitely saw it and probably loved it.  The first time I saw the series all the way through, I was a fan for life.  But the only way to see it, was the buy the VHS tapes which sold for $30 each and had 2 episodes.  That's almost $400.  That's way too much for any high school kid to pay.  That's really why Anime clubs began..</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion in Chicago</b></div><p>Anyways, Evangelion 1.0 has finally come to America and more specific it's showing in Chicago this whole week at The Music Box. [<a href="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion" title="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion">link</a>]. Some friends and I went down there yesterday.  Man, I was so excited!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp"  /></p><p>I don't think they could've been showing a more appropriate complementary movie alongside Evangelion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp"  /></p><p>I like how Funimation just sent the theater a cheap poster that's not even Movie Poster size.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp"  /></p><p>The Music Box has two theaters inside of it.  I wonder if their other theater is just as small as this one.  I doubt it could fit more than 200 people, and there were about 30 of us in there.  We were all Anime fans.  There were several people wearing Evangelion Tshirts too, which was pretty awesome. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>English Dubbed</b></div><p>I really had no idea if they were showing Evangelion with english subtitles or with the english dubbed track.  I don't know why, but I was actually surprised it was the English Dub.  I was actually pretty thankful because I had already watched the movie in Japanese at least a dozen times that this is actually something new!</p><p>Holy Shit!  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">The dub is hysterical.</span> Not just hysterical, but "font-weight: bold, font-size: 20px" hysterical.  <b>Funimation's Evangelion 1.0 puts Secret of Crystania to shame</b>.  In fact, there are several instances where there are DIRECT quotes from Crystania in Evangelion.  "If you're going to do it, do it now!", "You just don't get it, do you?" (Though, I guess those quotes are pretty generic.)  There were so many parts that were embarrassingly goofy, and I just couldn't stop but laugh.</p><p>If you thought Shinji was a whiny bitch in the original Dub of the series, Spike Spencer (the voice) brings it to a level you never thought possible.  It's so bad, there's no one that could possibly take it seriously.  You can't.  It's not serious.  It can't be serious.  His acting has got to be a ridiculous parody.</p><p>And it was fantastic that everyone in theater was on the same page.  I've never seen a movie where the audience was exactly in sync with the movie.  We laughed at the ridiculous acting.  We laughed at the parts that were supposed to be funny.  And were silent and polite when important stuff was going on.  It was like SPAMM, actually.</p><div class='title'><b>It's not that bad, though</b></div><p>Overall, the acting is pretty hilarious, but Allison Keith does a fantastic job with Misato.  Actually, Brina Palencia is really good as Rei, too, but Misato stands out because she's the one character with the most distinct personality in the entire movie.  It's so strong that it really feels like Misato in the main character.  She's the Han Solo to Shinji's whiny Luke Skywalker.  Which would make Pen Pen Chewbacca... i guess.</p><p>Though, her acting is only accented by the rather well done English script.  There were really just two parts that seemed lost in translation.  Though, that could have been because it was acted poorly.  But really, everything else made perfect sense and flowed quite well.  They did a great job keeping the script original and better written than the original series.  The writers definitely didn't half-ass the script.  They left the half-assing to the voice acters.</p><p>Evangelion 1.0 really does stand on its own as a movie, but leaves several hints towards the quadrilogy as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>North American DVD Release!</b></div><p>On November 17th, 2009 (3 weeks from now), Evangelion 1.0 will finally be released on DVD in North America.  Unfortunately, the Bluray won't be released until Spring 2010. [<a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/08/evangelion-1-01-dvd-release-announced/">link</a>].  By then, Evangelion 2.0 should be out on Bluray in Japan.</p><p>They're following a similar release schedule for the original Japanese release.  The first DVD release was entitled Evangelion 1.01.  They cleaned up a couple areas of the film, but in general it was identical to the theatrical release.  Later on, with the Bluray release, it was Evangelion 1.11, which contains some new scenes in there somewhere.  They fixed a few more areas of the film, and added 3 minutes to the beginning.  It is the best-selling Bluray in Japan to date at 49,000 copies (one of which is mine!). [<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/1st-k-on-volume-is-now-no.2-blu-ray-in-japan-so-far" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/1st-k-on-volume-is-now-no.2-blu-ray-in-japan-so-far">link</a>]</p><p>I'll continue to wait for the North American Bluray release.  If the DVDs underperform, hopefully they'll still consider the Bluray...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Brutal Legend" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/brutal-legend">Brutal Legend</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Brutal Legend is the latest game by Tim Schafer, and stars Jack Black as main character Eddie Riggs.  I think most people probably know this game as "Jack Black's video game."  He definitely has more reach than Schafer, and Black has been in the spotlight for almost all promotion of Brutal Legend.  But, Brutal Legend has Tim Schafer's feel through and through.</p><div class='title'><b>Tim Schafer</b></div><p>Tim Schafer is known for creating games with very solid stories backed by great comedic writing that blends into game design.  His career started at LucasArts in the hay day of PC adventure games.  He co-write and co-designed The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2, and then his role grew larger as he co-directed Day of the Tentacle.  His first true lead role came with <b>Full Throttle</b> in 1995, followed by <b>Grim Fandango</b> in 1998.</p><p>In 2000, he left LucasArts to form his own company, Double Fine Productions.  Their first game was <b>Psychonauts</b> released for PC, Xbox, and PS2 in 2005, which has garnered a very large cult following.</p><p>Psychonauts was my introduction to Tim Schafer.  Unfortunately, I skipped all those great LucasArts adventure games and still haven't gotten back to them.  It was because of its cult following that I finally tracked down a copy in 2007 for Xbox, and it's a pretty hilarious and fun game.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp"  /></p><p>In Psychonauts, you play a child who's been sent to summer camp to learn about psychokinetic powers.  These are taught by the camp counselors.  Trouble arises as many of the kids at the camp have had their brains stolen and have become mindless drones.  Throughout the game you venture into others minds to uncover the mystery and plot.</p><p>Psychonauts has some pretty funny characters with great writing.  The real comedy is the level design of the world's that exist inside of character's minds.  The characters are pretty goofy on the outside.  On the inside, their world is imbued with their theme.  There's a very strict and meticulous character, who's inner world is nothing but a cube.  There's a disco queen, who's inner world is a massive disco dance party.  One of my favorite levels is when you inhabit the mind of a fish, and its world puts you as a monster crushing the city beneath you.</p><p>The game itself is mostly platforming.  The camp is open world, and levels can be revisited to find all the secret crap.  Psychonauts definitely has its problems, but the writing and design created lovable characters and a memorable experience.  Brutal Legend follows that tradition very well but takes that blend of comedy, story, and game design even further.</p><div class='title'><b>Brutal Legend</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp"  /></p><p>For Brutal Legend, Schafer created a medieval world based out of his fandom for Heavy Metal music.  During his interview on Jimmy Fallon, Schafer said that, as a kid, all his Heavy Metal albums would have elaborately designed mountains and worlds of explosions, fire and brimstone.  He wanted to make a game where you could actually walk around in one of these worlds and see what it was like.  You can see that in almost all environments in the game.  The first areas have exhaust pipe trees, and steel bladed branches.  There are massive rock effigies of Band symbols, skulls and bones of gigantic beasts.</p><p>In this land, humans are used as slaves and pitted against one another while the demon lords usurp them for their own power and rule.  You, as Eddie Riggs, rescue these humans and build an army to eventually overthrow their rule.  In the world of Heavy Metal, building an army is a lot like building a band and a fan base.  You recruit headbangers, guitarists, roadies and plenty others.</p><p>The game itself is completely action/adventure, but features many instances where you team up with your troops to attack enemies.  You can command your troops to follow, attack, and defend.  These concepts explode further into a full on RTS battle.  You build merchandise booths over vents to hell to collect fans.  These fans are used to create units for battle.  The battle is won when you destroy the opposing team's stage on the other end of the field.  The RTS battles can also be played against people, which is the Multiplayer mode in Brutal Legend.</p><p>As the game explains, Roadies aren't the ones in the spotlight.  But they do direct and shape much of the concert experience.  If they do their job correctly, no one will even know that they're there.</p><div class='title'><b>Jack Black and casting</b></div><p>Schafer wanted to create an experience that die hard Heavy Metal fans would absolutely love and enjoy.  Also from that Fallon interview, Schafer mentioned that throughout initial production and design, he kept thinking to himself, "man, I hope (noted Heavy Metal super-fan) Jack Black will like our game."  When it came time to actually cast the role of the main character, it was a no-brainer to reach out to Jack Black and see if he'd be interested.</p><p>Many of the other characters in the game are voiced by notable Heavy Metal musicians, such as Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford of The Runaways, and Rob Halford of Judas Priest, all of whom basically play personas of themselves.  Additional voice work includes Tim Curry, Kyle Gass, David Cross, Steve Agee, and Brian Posehn (who actually went to high school with Schafer).</p><div class='title'><b>Heavy Metal</b></div><p>In another interview, Schafer has said that Brutal Legend should cater to Heavy Metal fans, but should not be so niche that the general public won't get most of the references.  I'm not a Heavy Metal fan by any means, but the casting and environments are pretty obvious.  Another interesting parallel which is probably more apparent to Heavy Metal fans, are the subtle comments towards the history of Heavy Metal.</p><p>Brutal Legend begins in present day with Eddie Riggs working with a "Metal" band called Kabbage Boy.  Kabbage Boy is a bunch of teen kid bringing Pop into Metal.  Riggs and another roadie talk about how kids these days just don't understand Heavy Metal and how Metal is dead.  "The early 70s were really the days of Heavy Metal."</p><p>After being sent back in time, the first major story arc is helping Lars (Rob Halford) and Lita (Lita Ford) overthrow current slavedriver, Lionwhyte.  Lionwhyte is a makeup donned pretty boy with massive hair and leather pants, a obvious parody of David Bowie in the 80s.</p><p>Much like those kids in the opening adding horrible current Pop culture into Heavy Metal, David Bowie and other Glam Rock bands did the same back in the 80s.  They were in the music because of the style and dressing up rather than the actual music.  Defeating Lionwhyte/Bowie serves as justice to all Heavy Metal fans out there.</p><p>After defeating Lionwhyte, some story occurs and the main love interest kills herself.  She's consumed and infected with in the Sea of Black Tears and becomes completely emo.  She returns to take you down, dressed in all black with blue skin and heavy eyeliner.  She raises her army from the dead, who are a bunch of emo kids with black hair and spikes.</p><p>Ophellia's return represents the rise of Death Metal in the 90s.  Heavy Metal thought there were finally done with the complete nonsense of Glam Rock, but now they have to deal with something far worse.  Eventually you defeat these emo brats and show that Heavy Metal fans are truly the best.</p><div class='title'><b>The Perfect Package</b></div><p>I'm not sure that this concept would work with any other music genre.  Heavy Metal has a history of branching sub-genres that the core fanbase hates that work as fantastic villains.  Heavy Metal has deep roots in Norse mythology, which paint a vibrant medieval landscape.  There are axes and swords and fire and demons.  Studded arm bands.  Skimpy dressed chicks riding fire beasts..</p><p>Everything in Brutal Legend works within the aspects of the Story, Gameplay and the theme of Heavy Metal.  Schafer may have ran into some problems with Psychonauts, but he definitely learned from them.  <b>Brutal Legend is one of the best designed games in a while</b>, and it never takes itself too seriously.  It's fun to play and fun to watch as well. ^_^</p><p>Definitely play this game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Season 4 of Dexter has been pretty decent so far.  It doesn't have the same allure and mystery of the first season, but definitely allows the characters to show some rich emotions.  There's plenty of suspense too.  But there have been a few things in these past 2 episodes that have really shown that Dexter, as a show, is back on its game.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b></em></p><div class='title'><b>The emotionless nature of a killer</b></div><p>In the beginning of episode 3, the Trinity killer works away on his second victim.  He brings her to the top of a warehouse and forces her to jump off by her own will.  Getting her to the warehouse and bringing her to the top is pretty easy, but now he has to threaten her to kill herself.  He does so by threatening her family.  With her children in danger, she lets go of the railing and falls to her death.</p><p>Near the end of the episode, Dexter is hunting down the neighborhood vandal.  He discovers who it is, and confronts him in his garage.  Exposing the vandal's identity isn't enough for the vandal to stop ruining the neighborhood.  Dexter roughs him up a little bit, but the vandal refuses.  He has nothing to lose.  Dexter threatens the vandal's family, and the vandal changes his mind pretty quickly.</p><p>I find it interesting how both Trinity and Dexter arrive to the same persuasive tactics, when all other options have been exhausted.  Being killers, they have no emotional connection to their victim, their victim's lives, or life in general.  They will stop at nothing to get their way, and will perform any action to get it.</p><p>Though, it doesn't really sound like much, but it was a parallel occurrence in this episode that linked Trinity and Dexter.  Dexter (the show) attempts to profile what it is to be a killer.  Every killer doesn't follow the same code, but perhaps a killer's code has a general set of guidelines?</p><div class='title'><b>Solving problems</b></div><p>Dexter's "dark passenger" brings him to interesting places and follows convenient leads.  Though, many of those leads in the first two seasons were very convenient for story.  In Season 1, Dexter stalked and killed a couple who were exploiting illegal Cuban immigrants.  After capturing and subduing the couple, he actually talked with them a little bit about relationships and how to "make it work."</p><p>Dexter was having trouble figuring out how to act as a boyfriend to Rita and didn't have anyone to talk to.  The only people he really can talk to are his victims, those who see Dexter for who he really is.  Dexter has no trouble talking to them about this problems, because he's comfortable.  He knows this conversation and "friendship" has a very soon expiration date.  This happens a couple other times, especially when confronts the man who killed his mother.</p><p>In episode 4 of Season 4, Dexter (the show) returns to this problem solving technique when Dexter (the character) stalks and captures a woman who murdered her own family.  A woman who couldn't take the annoying, badgering, constant time loss of the daily grind of family life, so she "solved" it in a way most convenient for her.</p><p>Dexter has been fighting many of the same problems with married life, and "talks" about them with his victim.  Through their dialogue, he grows.  He finds out in himself that he really loves his family and that he would do anything to keep them from harm.</p><p>The release of his dark passenger always gives him clarity.  Room enough to think his way through his social problems.  Yes, killing does get in the way of his family life, but it's essential for his character growth, and for the show as well.</p><p>I don't remember this happening in Season 3 at all.</p><div class='title'><b>8 episodes remain</b></div><p>Season 4 is certainly returning to what made Dexter great.  I still think they're throwing too much suspense into the mix to distract away from the many many plot lines that no one cares about.  But Dexter and Trinity are the stars of this Season and are going strong.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/45">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/43">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
