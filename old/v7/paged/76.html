if the message has attachments<br/>- multipart/alternative - if the message has a text/plain alt for it's html part<br/>- text/plain - if the message is just text<br/>- text/html - if the message is just html</p><p>once i had this graph, building the code was rather easy..  you've got 4 entry points (indicated by the * above) and 2 exit points.  return text/html if it exists, otherwise return text/plain:<br/><pre><br/><b></b>    private BodyMessage getMessageBody(Message msg) throws MessagingException, IOException<br/><b></b>    {<br/><b></b>        Part messagePart = msg;<br/><b></b>        String contentType = msg.getContentType();<br/><b></b>        Object content = messagePart.getContent();<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        while(contentType.contains("multipart/mixed"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            //if the message type is mixed, grab the first child<br/><b></b>            //the other children are attachments<br/><b></b>            messagePart = ((Multipart) content).getBodyPart(0);<br/><b></b>            content = messagePart.getContent();<br/><b></b>            contentType = messagePart.getContentType();<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        if(contentType.contains("multipart/alternative"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            //if the message type is an alternative, grab the text/html part (second part)<br/><b></b>            try<br/><b></b>            {<br/><b></b>                messagePart = ((Multipart) content).getBodyPart(1);<br/><b></b>            }<br/><b></b>            catch(Exception e)<br/><b></b>            {<br/><b></b>                //or grab the text/plain part, if the text/html part doesn't exist.<br/><b></b>                messagePart = ((Multipart) content).getBodyPart(0);<br/><b></b>            }<br/><b></b>            content = messagePart.getContent();<br/><b></b>            contentType = messagePart.getContentType();<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        if(contentType.contains("text/plain"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            return new BodyMessage(content.toString(), "text/plain");<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b>        else if(contentType.contains("text/html"))<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            return new BodyMessage(content.toString(), "text/html");<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b>        return new BodyMessage("No text found in received message.", "text/plain");<br/><b></b>    }<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>    private class BodyMessage<br/><b></b>    {<br/><b></b>        public String msg;<br/><b></b>        public String mimeType;<br/><b></b><br/><b></b>        public BodyMessage(String msg, String mimeType)<br/><b></b>        {<br/><b></b>            this.msg = msg;<br/><b></b>            this.mimeType = mimeType;<br/><b></b>        }<br/><b></b>    }<br/></pre><br/>____</p><p>interesting enough, i had come across this same type of multipart interface before when developing the file uploading application with ASP/VBscript.</p><p>Whenever you want to use an HTML form to send a file somewhere you must use the multipart/form-data encoding type for the form, like so:<br/><pre><br/>&lt;form name="form" id="form" method="post" action="fileupload.jsp" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;<br/></pre><br/>that will grab all the raw binary data from the file, and slap it onto the Request object sent to the next page.  parts of the internet aren't so mutually exclusively coded after all, are they? ^_^</p><p>also, through stress testing the form submitting file uploading, 2 gigs of data is far too large.  the form can't build and send the data without crashing.  the limitations of html.  i'd guess more than 2^31 bytes is too much.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Richard Divine @ Inferno, Madison" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/richard-divine-inferno">Richard Divine @ Inferno, Madison</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Their music was quite amazing, but their lyrics seemed rather simple.  Their were like any country song or 90s pop song.  verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental, chorus.  oh well.. it was a family event type thing, so the whole drunken irish thing didn't quite take off.</p><p>But, wholey, i was inspired.  The crowd was pumped, and my friends were in awe.  I missed that feeling.  The feeling of enjoying the music to its full extent that you feel it throughout your body.  That same feeling everyone feels in the club that builds an immense vibe.  I felt like everyone at gaelic storm had that feeling except for me.  I felt that vibe at the concert, but it wasn't my vibe.</p><p>As soon as i returned from racine, i hopped on the internet in search of outlets.  I wanted to reclaim that feeling that i once had with my music.  i found quite a bit of things scattered throughout the weekends in madison.</p><p>Richard Devine was going to be at Inferno on friday and this was exactly what i wanted and he did not disappoint.</p><p>i was expected some pure techno beats coming from those speakers, but the man is a technical artist.  he tore up every track he played.  amazing.  i'm surprised my ears aren't still ringing.</p><p>also amazing was dj espe who headlined.  i arrived well into his amazing electro set.</p><p>inferno has certainly pulled itself together from what i remember of it back in the day.  maybe i just missed the good nights or something.  even though the place only had about 200 or 300 people, the vibe was definately there and some organization is present.</p><p>this coming weekend Nosmo formerly of Grayarea will descend on madcity along with Phil of eccentric beats headlining.  i remember seeing that guy all the time in minneapolis ^_^.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Import DS Games to look out for" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/import-ds-games-to-look-out-for">Import DS Games to look out for</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's very Earthbound/Mother -esq as this professor crash lands on earth and you are enlisted to helping him either get off the planet, or save the planet, or something. On the top screen, you have the interior of the professor's ship which has a very earthbound art style. The bottom screen, features a more realistic art style representing earth. Contact features a WiFi mode, to which i haven't really researched much.</p><p>Elite Beat Agents</p><p>Elite Beat Agents is the american sequel to Ouendan, one of the most popular japanese DS games in america. Elite Beat Agents / Ouendan is the creators of Gitaroo Man, and focuses on touching the screen when notes appear to go along with the song. The story consists of cheering people in need to better their lives ^_^</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 - October?</p><p>Oh Baby... The new Phoenix Wright game for the DS. It seems the sequels of Phoenix Wright focus on different points in the overall timeline. I think in the 3rd Gyakuten Saiban game, you play as Mia Fey. I'm not sure when this game takes place, but it looks like the past.<br/>http://www3.capcom.co.jp/ds_saiban/<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xenosaga III Fuck up" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xenosaga-iii-fuck-up">Xenosaga III Fuck up</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It featured one dungeon to be played, and a couple other things..</p><p>At the time when monolith created the demo, the game was probably 90% complete. All the story was set in the game, all dungeons, all everything except for some minor details here and there.</p><p>When they made this demo, monolith simply took a little bit of the actual game and made it playable so that people could experience a dungeon from the game.</p><p>It wasn't long before japanese haxxors messed around with the disc to grab source data, just to see what was on the disc, or to get raw data..</p><p>WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ASTOUNDING</p><p>apparently, to save time, Monolith decided to include the entire database full of story, quotes, etc rather than pick it apart to only include data relevant to the demo..</p><p>and once this information hit 2ch, the game was blown wide open.. All details for the conclusion of Xenosaga are now fully known to the public before the release of the game.

| April 15, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>about two weeks ago i got my DS lite and immediately started playing through the games i already own. i started off with Trauma Center and Castlevania with a little Tetris DS on the side. Trauma Center gets rather frustrating at times, so i began focusing on Castlevania quite a bit more. The other day i beat it, and today i finished going through it a second time. I'm somewhat burnt out on it now, so i decided to start playing Phoenix Wright and give Castlevania a rest.<br/>___</p><p>Phoenix Wright is a text-adventure based game where you have two settings. One setting is in the court room, and the other is outside of the court room.</p><p>When you're in the court room, the prosecution lays out their case and brings witnesses to the stand. Dialogue is spoken back and forth, usually comical ^_^. The gameplay of the court room is when you cross-examine the witness on the stand.</p><p>Each part of the witness testimony you can 'Press', as in, press the witness to clearly state what they mean by what they say, OR you can 'Present', as in, present evidence to teh court that shows a clear contradiction in the witness testimony. Usually the witness will restate their testimony so you'll have to find flaws in that. It keeps going until you clearly show they're lying. (so far, anyways)</p><p>The entire 1st chapter of Phoenix Wright is in the court; however, the second chapter features the other part of the gameplay.</p><p>Outside of court, the gameplay is exactly the same as Shadowgate, Deja Vu, and, of course, Snatcher ^_^. Look, Move, See, Do.. or in other words, Talk, Move, Examine, Present for Phoenix Wright. You move around locations you know of talking to people, searching for clues and gathering evidence for you case.<br/>___</p><p>The stylus is all you need when playing Phoenix Wright. Click, click, click. Although, instead the stylus, you can use the directional pad, buttons, and microphone. Holding down the Y button will activate the mic when appropriate. Instead of clicking on 'Present' during the court proceeding, you yell out OBJECTION or 'take that' to show the contradictions in the witnesses testimony.<br/>___</p><p>I think i read somewhere that Phoenix Wright has only 5 chapters. And after playing for about 3 1/2 hours, i've completed 2 of them. Chapter 1 only took about a 1/2 hour though. Chapter 2 was very involved.<br/>___</p><p>The gameplay is somewhat basic, but the story and the characters MAKE this game. The story moves rather quickly, and (even though it's sort of linear) you feel like you have control over the story. I think there were two parts that could have gone differently so far, but didn't affect the overall outcome.</p><p>It's pretty funny too. When any character is caught in a lie, or surprised, they have such grim animations for the facial expressions. It's very Anime-esq. Megaton told me that there were alot of Phoenix Wright doujinshi out there, and i can totally see why.<br/>___</p><p>Honestly ... this game is fantastic. widely entertaining, funny, intuitive. definately a must PLAY for any gamer.</p><p>I mentioned to Tony that Snatcher or Policenauts would make a perfect transition to the DS. Looks like Capcom beat them there with a completely new game instead ^_^. Honestly, i think Snatcher has been ported to death, but i'd love to see Policenauts make it stateside for once. A DS port might be the answer. even though Policenauts is almost 10 years old.. -_-;;</p><p>man.. the DS has some amazing games. Trauma Center, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, Phoenix Wright, Tetris DS.. and i haven't even touched Sonic Rush to its full extent. A++<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gamecube - Odama" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gamecube-odama">Gamecube - Odama</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The point of each level is to command your troops across the battlefield transporting the Ninten Bell from your end to the gate at the enemy's end. You command the troops using the gamecube microphone which is included ^_^. "press forward", "advance", "move left", "fall back" are all phrases spoken into the microphone to guide your army.</p><p>those commands are spoken while controlling the Odama, a gigantic ball rolling across the battlefield flattening both friend and foe. You have flippers on your side to knock it around the field.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" /></p><p>most objects in the field have to be taken out in order for your army to advance.<br/>____</p><p>So far i've only played it for a 1/2 hour before getting back to homework, and i really enjoy it ^_^. It is very challenging since you must be accurate with the Odama to knock over certain houses to gain items, or hit buildings that'll turn into bridges.</p><p>Doing two things at once is challenging enough, but to keep track of how much of your army is dying in battle and making sure your pinball does get lost adds complex natures to both your tasks.</p><p>"luckily, by the end of this game you'll be a god at pinball"</p><p>it might be easier to have one person control the troops, and the other control the odama, but probably not as fun.</p><p>definately worth a look ^_^. i'm debating whether or not to bring it to SPAMM tomorrow.</p><p>it's $50 at k-mart which is a bit pricey. This will probably be one of those games that'll have a short print and then disappear, so i don't regret the $50. Though, i'll probably do a little switch with best buy since they have a $5 coupon for this week.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to V for Vendetta" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/v-for-vendetta">V for Vendetta</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Film classes need to put down there pencils and pile into the theaters right this very moment in order to learn and feel what it is to make a movie.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers have done it again.</p><p>I think we have ourselves a movie of the year here. Is there any of other movie that could really compare to the magnitude of V for Vendetta. This movie is beyond powerful. It's as if the Wachowski Brothers harnessed pure energy at a neutronic level and simply shaped it into film.</p><p>is it possible for the Wachowski Brothers to actually make a bad movie? i mean, really? It's like asking if an Italian could make a bad pizza.</p><p>People need to give these guys more money because they honestly deserve it. I just emailed them my bank account numbers. You should too!</p><div class='title'><b>V for Violence</b></div><p>This is where the film clearly shines as the main character using his Matrix style moves to kill people. Slow motion is used to detail the knives as the glisfully float through the air into their victims.</p><p>It's a form of art really.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers must have some sort of extra sensory vision in order to visualize the impact of each individual knife and then clearly transfer this thought process into film.</p><p>It's like the Wachowski Brothers are god except there are two of them. Oh man, what if they really were god. Who knows how are universe would have been shaped and created if the Wachowski Brothers made it. Two half gods are better than one?</p><div class='title'><b>V for.. Five?</b></div><p>V is not actually for Vendetta, it's for the roman numeral Five. He named himself this as his was in the fifth room of this detention facility. #Five you have a kindred spirit.</p><p>beyond that, five is a very powerful number. It's the third smallest prime number. It's the only prime number to end in the digit 5. It takes place in the fibonacci sequence.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of sides in a Pentagon. What could this mean? The whole movie is about government rule and such. Perhaps the Wachowski Brothers are trying to tell us something with our own government in this movie.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of points in a Star and 5 Stars refers to the rating system most movies are judged upon.</p><div class='title'><b>V for Victory</b></div><p>This film is positively amazing and i would see it over and over again if i had the time.</p><p>19 1/2 thumbs up.  all the way.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Must Play Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/must-play-games">Must Play Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 16, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This semester has really flown by.. It seems that just the other day we were beginning school and there were a ton of games coming out on the horizon.. albeit my anticipating games thread from the end of summer: http://www.spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=3265</p><p>Everyone of those games that came out and i actually invested time to play has completely satisfied me. Chaos Field is actually pretty involved now that i've figured out how to play it. I had great memories playing We Love Katamari. Shadow of the Collosus was amazing, even though it got too tedious. DDR extreme 2 had some great new songs, but you had to unlock them. and Gunstar Super Heroes was everybit as good as the original.</p><p>So what is on the horizon now... what are we all looking forward to in our gaming futures.. lemme see here:</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo Gamecube</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Yoot Saito's Odama</b></div><p>Odama was a pretty interesting and innovative concept when i first about it from E3 earlier this year. It's a real-time strategy pinball game, where you use your pinball to destroy the opposing army while you use the Gamecube Microphone to direct your troops to storm the opposing armies gates.</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b></div><p>I've been waiting for this game a long long time and everything i hear about it makes me want it more and more. The game looks simply amazing.</p><p><b>Pikmin 2</b> for cheap</p><p>WHEN WHEN WHEN is this game going to go down in price.. so many retailers still have this game in stock but it refuses to go down in price. It's been out for a year and a half and is STILL $50. GO DOWN IN PRICE ALREADY!!</p><div class='title'><b>Revolution & Hideo Kojima</b></div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that he is in love with the revolution and has big big plans in store for console. He says, "..when comparing all of the next-generations consoles.. the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 are really just the same gaming experience. The Revolution is completely different from the other consoles which makes it very excitiing.." Sounds exciting to me.. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Sony Playstation 2</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence</b></div><p>This is probably my most-wanted Playstation 2 title at the moment. MGS3 completely blew me away with it's amazing story-telling style, well thought out and interesting characters, deep rich enviroments, and excellent gameplay. and recently with it's 39/40 famitsu rating, says that this update makes it near perfect. ebgames.com says it'll come out around mid-march for a cheap $30.</p><div class='title'><b>Rogue Galaxy</b></div><p>I really haven't been all that interested in RPGs at the moment. Maybe the reason is because i don't want to be tied down to a tv in order to play them. After playing the Final Fantasy XII demo, i was actually somewhat interesting in playing that game, but good 'ol Level 5 blows FFXII out of the water with Rogue Galaxy. The graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks very more interactive and fun rather than the stoicism of FFXII. I hope my view on RPGs change in time for this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Okami</b></div><p>I've actually been waiting for this game quite a while as well. Okami features cell-shading in a much different direction than traditional games. It presents hand-drawn calligraphy mixed with animation much like Zelda and Viewtiful Joe. Gamespot says it results in a rich, stylized appearance that they've never seen before.. currently, it's projected to come out stateside by May 2006.</p><div class='title'><b>In the Groove 2</b></div><p>I've been so burnt out on Dance Dance Revolution. This past weekend i tried playing DDR Extreme Japan but i got so completely bored with it, i couldn't force myself to play it anymore.. my saving grace was In the Groove with it's challenging foot charts, but uninspiring music. But i've had a couple ITG songs in my head over the past couple of weeks, so i always like coming back to it over DDR. My wish is that ITG2 will have amazing music to revitalize dancing games for me, so here's hoping ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Microsoft Xbox 360</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Tetris the Grandmaster Ace</b></div><p>Tetris has always been one of my favorites puzzle games and the grandmaster series makes it very difficult to get your way. As you increase in levels, your speed is decreased to compensate for the amount of points you've gotten in the previous level. Tetris the grandmaster has mutliple modes of play as well, including Death Mode where blocks immediately hit the ground with no falling time. There's also an online multiplayer mode for Xbox Live.</p><p>I would buy this game immediately if it came out over here because there has not been a good version of Tetris on a console in a long long time, and Grandmaster is quite challenging.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo DS</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Children of Mana</b></div><p>I've always loved the graphical sytle of the Seiken Densetsu series. I love playing Sword of Mana and Legend of Mana, even though it seems others don't.</p><p><b>Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow</b> for less than $30</p><p>After hearing so much about this game, and playing through Aria of Sorrow for a second time, i really want to get into this game. But it's so expensive and i don't have a DS either.. sigh. I might need to suck it up and buying it for $35 before it's impossible to find.</p><p><b>Sonic Rush</b> for cheap ^_^</p><p>I've heard many good things about this newest 2D Sonic game. Some people say that finally, a true 2D Sonic sequel that brings back all the warm feelings of the Genesis. When i get a DS, this game will definately be in my library.</p><div class='title'><b><u>PSP</u></b></div><p><b>Every Extend Extra</b> (E3)</p><p>This is the spiritual sequel to Rez. Tetsuya Mizuguchi brings his expertise from Lumines and Rez togehter into one musical rhythmic psychadelic package once again. I cannot wait. This will get me to buy a PSP.</p><p><b>I My Me Katarmai</b> (or whatever it's called)</p><p>Katamari always spawns a great gaming experience and with their new portable version, the multiplayer aspect has been the main focus. Should be alot of fun ^_^.</p><p><b>Lumines</b> for cheap cheap cheap</p><p>I love this game, but it's $40 everywhere i go.. sadness.</p><p>________________________</p><p>well that's all i can think of off the top of my head.. I think there's a game on every platform that i'm looking forward to which makes gaming quite various<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-perfect-dark-zero-impressions">Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the past couple of weeks, there has been a steady stream of xbox 360 things in my living room.. First there was a controller, then a memory card, then Perfect Dark Zero, and then tuesday night, there was an Xbox 360.</p><p>I watched my roommate play PDZ a little bit, but i wasn't really all that impressed.. the graphics looked hokey, and the character movements were pretty primitive.</p><p>After my rough day of studying, testing and finishing up projects, and between playing Chaos Field i decided to check it out since it was just sitting there.<br/>________</p><p>The Xbox 360 is differently designed than all other systems i've played before.. including PC games. When you start up the Xbox 360 and it loads a game, the 360 requires a login. the 360, not the game. You can have multiple profiles on one 360, and each profile needn't have Xbox live. But you must be logged in to play games.</p><p>The game uses this profile for saving progress, records and other data, besides the most import use of having an Xbox Live persona. Each account has it's own settings and data for every game played with that profile.</p><p>So unlike PC games, ps2 or gamecube where each person would have a seperate save file for their data, all data is organized by profile, so if you want your stuff, you only need log in the 360 under your name and the system tells the game which file to load for you.</p><p>very impressive. data management is a snap.</p><p>The wireless controllers have a more user-friendly design than the wavebird controllers. Once you start up the machine, you hit the Xbox button on the controller. It'll assign itself to the xbox, and then light up part of the Xbox button showing which player number it is. This is also represented on the front of the 360 showing how many controllers the system recognizes.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what'll happen when you have 2 Xbox 360 consoles next to each other and attempt to register controllers.. I wonder how they solve this problem.</p><p>Aside from that, it REALLY REALLY REALLY annoys me that the Xbox 360 isn't backwards compatible with every Xbox game. I can play Fable, but i can't play Metal Slug 3 or Fatal Frame 2 or Panzer Dragoon Orta or Crazy Taxi 3. worthless... that was my saving grace for buying some of these games. i could play them now on other's xboxes, and later i can play them on my xbox 360. so much for that one.<br/>_________________</p><p>anyways, my roommate is a huge console fps fan, so naturally he picked up the Xbox 360's flagship title: Perfect Dark Zero.</p><p>PDZ is pretty dissapointing in my opinion. This opinion is pretty justified when my roommate came home last night with a copy of Quake 4 to play instead of this game.</p><p>Perfect Dark Zero is exactly the same game it was 5 years ago with alot of graphical upgrades. The AI will not use any clever tactics to try and take you down. An enemy will not think twice of walking into a room that has your gun fixed on the door. Every single time, i can pop outside and fire a clip. Then duck back into the room, and wait for their slow ass to run in the room, stand in front of me and wait a second for me to shoot them dead.</p><p>Not to mention that the character animation is so stoic, it looks like they used the same animation from the Nintendo 64 game. It feels exactly the same in appearance. how lazy can you be....</p><p>so far i've made it up through Mission number 5 at this point, and the story is absolutely cliche and horrible. Joanna is presented as Lara Croft clone with her veteran pal, Joe, presented as a Bruce Willis clone. Halo 1 and 2 are FAR more interesting than this game, even they are pretty cliche as well.</p><p>Playing this game is pretty annoying, but it's rather addicting at the same time..</p><p>The graphics haven't blown me away at all... there have been some things i've stopped to look it and thought, "that's looks pretty neat.." But then i turn away and get back to the mission. Most of the graphics are have pretty standard for Playstation 2, but the powerful lighting effects of the Xbox 360 pull everything together to give it a clean crisp shiny look.</p><p>On occasion though, the lighting effects look really hokey. Especially when you're infiltrating this chinese palace covered in snow. The snow gives off a blue hue in the moonlight night, but the orange from the fire defuses the reality and makes the enviroment look CG.<br/>____________</p><p>anyways... Perfect Dark Zero thus far has been pretty unimpressive, but it's still kinda fun.. from the purchase of Quake 4, it obviously won't hold over my roommate until Halo 3 comes out next year sometime.</p><p>I'd like to see some great games on the machine though. Fable 2 should be amazing. I really hope they bring Tetris the grand master stateside. I also look forward to Ninety-Nine Knights, Blue Dragoon, and a few other games.. maybe even Final Fantasy XI and Rumble Roses XX.</p><p>The Xbox 360 is pretty well designed, but it feels more like an Xbox 1.5 than a whole new system. The Xbox 360 graphics don't look ALL that better than the Xboxes.. for the time being, anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/77">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/75">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
