True enough, the packet was extremely spicy. But there was only one pack, so i just dumped everything in there and didn't really care all that much.</p><p>This instant meal was one of those where you pour boiling water into a bowl of noodles and seasoning. Then, let the whole thing cook by itself for a couple minutes after that.  </p><p>After it was done, the whole thing had a very strong smell, almost too strong.  *cough*  The noodles had a very plastic texture, too.  They didn't taste like noodles at all and felt very stale.  I may have gotten some fucked up package of this stuff, but overall, I think it was not very good.</p><p>I give Myojo's Instant Noodle Duck Flavour <b>1 out of 5 stars</b>.  blahck.. akc..  Not delicious.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_pohtak.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_pohtak.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/mama_pohtak.webp" /></p><p>Next up is <b>Mama's Instant Noodles Poh Tak Flavour</b>.</p><p>I pre-tasted for spiciness, and it was actually rather smooth for a change.  It was an interesting change compared to the others.  </p><p>These noodles were prepared in the same way to the normal instant noodles.  Poor in boiling water, then cover for 3 minutes.  This method did not work out at all, though. The noodles were still very stiff after the 3 minute mark. I think from now on i'm going to cook all these meals for 3 minutes after I poor in the boiling water.</p><p>The poh tak flavor ended up being too spicy to consume after all, which was sad.  I thought I had finally found a good tasting ramen. Unfortunately, Mama's Instant Noodles Poh Tak flavour receives <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>.  Not all that great.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kimchi Ramen" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kimichi-ramen">Kimchi Ramen</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Though, unlike most days where I would make rice, and then mess around with it, today I made one of those Instant meals they had available for a dime. Today's experimentation of flavor comes from Thailand in the form of <b> Mama's Instant Rice Vermicelli Duck Flavour </b>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/duck_vermecci.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/duck_vermecci.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ramen/duck_vermecci.webp" /></p><p>In my professional opinion: this stuff is weird. Normally, you'd think a food item with the word duck in it would taste normal.  But, damm...</p><p>First off, the rice vermicelli noodles looked more like a chunk of shredded wheat than actual noodles. Secondly, after I put the seasoning on the noodles, they smell was weird and quite intoxicating. It was definitely not normal.  That should have tipped me off..  the seasoning came in 3 different pouches that I could not read what-so-ever, so i dumped all three onto the chunk and then boiled some water to begin.</p><p>After the cooking process was complete, it was time to eat. The noodles were pretty delicious, not the best, but it was good.  After the noodles were eaten, I started in on the liquid.  *cough cough* .. *ack.. hack !!*..  ack..  Holy spicy..*cough cough*. Man, this stuff is extremely spicy. I couldn't even finish it.  I think that third seasoning pouch was extra spicy seasoning meant for those people that drink tabasco sauce daily.  I bought two of these instant duck things, so I think I'll try again minus to tiny pouch of death spice.</p><p>Otherwise not bad! I give Mama's Instant Rice Vermicelli Duck Flavour <b>2 out of 5 stars</b>.  Any instant meal that I cannot finish loses alot of points in my book, even if it did cost a dime.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hybrid @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hybrid">Hybrid @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Friday night was one of the best club experiences yet, right up there with Sasha, BT, Paul van Dyk and The Crystal Method.  It was simply amazing. ah.. it was a dream come true hearing Symphony live just as it was hearing Sasha play Xpander live. I think now because those 2 dreams have been met my electronic past has been satisfied. Its kinda sad that i have such a small past, but that was basically it: Sasha + Hybrid.</p><p>And not only was experiencing their music a dream come true, but they are very conversational with their fan. Afterward, they were in the back on the club signing stuff.  I got my new Morning Scifi CD signed as well as some Hybrid plate mats ^_^. Stu got his synth signed by Hybrid. Very nice! Mike Truman and Adam Taylor are real nice guys ^_^.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/031114/hybrid_scifi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/031114/hybrid_scifi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/031114/hybrid_scifi.webp" /></p><p>Spending the night with Kristina and Stu at The Fine Line was much more fun than being there alone.  Before hybrid graced the stage, we sat down near the floor making fun of Mason T's extremely predictable tribal/house set. ick.. It was a slow start for such a great night.</p><p>After hybrid, one of the Dubpistols got up there and played some nice songs. Though, it was a backdrop to us waiting in line for signatures.  The guy played the always fun 'Smells like Freeland' by Nirvana. I hadn't heard that song in a while ^_^</p><p>It was great the entire night.  And afterward, outside the club, there was a huge brawl.  Black women beating the shit out of each other.  The cops came and put a quick stop to that. They gassed everyone around the car, and everyone ran the hell away from there coughing and heaving. it was neat ^_^   Street crime!! I did not take photos, though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Game Theory Lecture" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-theory-lecture">Game Theory Lecture</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 13, 2003 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Tonight's math lecture was quite interesting, as John from UW Madison came down and spoke about game theory. He said that every game can be split up until two piles: Games of Chance and Games of No-Chance, meaning there could be a winning strategy involved to win. He later corrected himself that they are also Games of Skill, Physics, and etc. Games of Chance would be games like Yatzee and Poker, and Games of No-Chance would be Checkers, Chess, Go, Othello, Tic-Tac-Toe, Battleship, and Stratego.</p><p>He further expanded upon the No-Chance category into games where all the information is known to both players, and games where not all the information is known to both players. Obvious games where some information is hidden would be Battleship and Stratego. All the information is known in games like Checkers and Chess because you can see all the pieces on the board.</p><p>He further expanded the known category into games where players have the same moves, and where players have different moves. Players that have different moves would be Chess and Checkers again because one player can only move their pieces. For games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello, you have the same moves because you lay pieces.Games of this nature are known as non-partisan games.</p><p>Further explaining the structures of games, you can't split every game into these finite categories. There are other categories that games can fall under as well, like 2 player v. multiplayer, winning conditions, and finite moves v. infinite moves. He said that he would be explaining winning strategies for 2 player non-partisan games with finite number of moves where the last person to move wins. This is called combinatorial game theory.</p><p>He went through 3 main games: 2-player Nim, Hex, and Chocolate Bars. He explained that there isn't a definite winning strategy for each player, but there are ad hoc strategies that do work. For 2-player Nim the second player will always win if you match the first player's moves. For Hex, if you're the first player, assuming there is a winning strategy for the second player, you can use that strategy, and if you come across your original move, you have the advantage. For Chocolate Bars, depending on the amount of total pieces the bar can be broken into, if the total pieces are odd than the first player will always win regardless of strategy, moves, or anything. If the total pieces are even, the same is true for the second player.</p><p>Pretty interesting stuff. ^_^ Unfortunately, the guy ran out of time when he was about 70% through his presentation, which skipped over further strategies for NIM and discussion of nimbers in other factions of mathematics. His short presentation also skipped over discussion on Dots, which is a game i love to play, and kick ass at. But, he had to skip over it... sigh.</p><p>I think I should look into that "surreal numbers" book he reference at the end of his lecture, as well as "the theory of dots" ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ferry Corsten @ The Quest" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ferry-corsten-the-quest">Ferry Corsten @ The Quest</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 10, 2003 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend at the quest was amazing</p><p>The whole Matrix theme of the early night was fun and well pulled off.  They had the red leather chairs on stage behind the decks, and a small table with black dialup phones on a dark maroon cloth.  Phenix M was dressed as Neo working the decks up until DJ Rap.  Jack Trash and that other guy dressed as the twins.  Josh Grub, the photographer, and other 'roadies' dressed as an agents, and either I think Jack Trash's wife or Phenix M's girl dressed as Trinity.</p><p>They also had a contest the entire night.  When you entered you were given a key, and if your key open the box in the back, you'd win what was inside. I later found out that inside were VIP passes to every SIM event from that day on, some cds, shirts, and other stuff.  I also later found out that no one won the prize, hehe.</p><p>A few times during Phenix M's set, a dressed up person would come up, pick up the phone and then retreat back to backstage. The end of Phenix M's set happened when Jack Trash and the other guy, dressed as the Twins came out and grabbed Phenix M, dressed as Neo, drug him off the stage and beat him up. ^_^  hilarious.</p><p>Phenix M's set overall just blew me away, "it was exactly what i needed to hear" as far as curing all this ending semester "needing to write research papers" stress. ^_^  As mentioned earlier, DJ Rap surprisingly played Breaks instead of her usual Drum & Bass.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, actually, almost enough to perhaps sample her newest CD with a Breaks set on it.  At the end of her set, she spun her newest remix: a Drum & Bass remix of Tainted Love by Soft Cell, at least I think thats the song.</p><p>Ferry Corsten spun an excellent set. Though, I only recognized the songs he wrote. The crowd went NUTS over Punk. They chanted along with the beats to the song just the same as on that cd. The crowd also went nuts over his new single he played, Rock my Body Rock.  Very great music, and The Quest was quite packed as well. Still, I don't think it'll ever be as packed as it was for Delta Heavy. ^_^</p><p>An excellent night.  I only took a few pictures though because I really wasn't in a photography mood, and the pictures I did take all came out horrid. Though, Josh Grub's pics I'm sure will be illustration enough of the Matrix themed night. ^_^  He'll post them on mnvibe.com.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Columbian Exchange" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-columbian-exchange">The Columbian Exchange</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 13, 2003 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My next big due date happens to be this coming thursday, when I have some kind of test on <i>The Columbian Exchange</i> by Alfred W. Crosby, a book assigned to be read by this Thursday for World Civilization II. But unlike most other history books required for reading, the one is actually quite interesting as it discusses the biological effects of what America was to what it is today.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>When the Europeans landed in America in 1492, the bridge between the two sides of the globe was formed and what the Europeans saw in America completely shocked them. They had never before seen an iguana, an alligator, a rattlesnake, a monkey that swung from branches with its tail, nor bison and buffalo. Before this time, horses, cattle, chickens, pigs, donkeys and such were exclusive only to the old world.</p><p>The biggest domesticated quadaped in the new world was the dog. Since the new world had never seen horses, or anything else before, the Native Americans were shocked and frightened to see such beasts being ridden by man. And when the settlers finally did attack and masacare the Native Americans, such fear felt by the Native Americans would be the same as if the planet Earth were attacked by an alien race of superior technology. It's as if our America as we live in today, is the result of an alien invasion over 500 years ago that completely raped and wiped out the previous life, settled, and grew with no regard for the previous inhabitants.</p><p>The book gives an example of Orson Well's War of the Worlds as being a close similarity to the fights. The settlers had superior defenses and offenses, superior weaponry, and the settlers also brought with them highly infectious viruses they already knew about, but the native Americans had never seen before in their lives. I think we know how that went.</p><p>Back when the settlers returned to America, they brought with them horses, cattle, swine, and so forth. The land was so vast and "untouched" that it was perfect for these animals, who in America had no real predator, to roam free and multiply at unheard numbers. Some ranches that lost 30-40 of their cattle, would later find the cattle in pastures had multiplied to about 400 in only a matter of a few decades.</p><p>Passing by ships through the tropic islands between North and South America would simply drop off a few dozens pigs on some of the islands, then return in a few decade to their heards' exponential growth. Who knows how much plantlife had gone extinct at this time, when these animals devoured every plant that was edible.</p><p>So many of the animals brought over to the Americas escaped free to nature. Cats and goats, as well. Later on in the 19th century, Charles Darwin toured the Americas and saw that the more docile and domesticated species in Europe were now furociously transformed and deadly to survive and live on their own for the past 300 years in the Americas. How the sweet cute cat when found later in the mountains of South America had grown in overall size, bore greater fangs, and hunted its prey more stealthlike. How the very docile goat in the mountains grew larger horns, and attacked trespassers.</p><p>This brought about more discussion of evolution and survival, ontop of the already conversial and debated theories of where all the species of Native America could have come from. Like, if Noah had 2 of every animal on his ark, which was in Jeruselum, how did all these unheard of species exist on the other side of the world, if they had no way to get there, and God flooded the entire earth? Many debates were constructed about the bering land bridge, or that the flood didn't flood as far as America.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Anyways, I'm over halfway through the book, but the author retells the details over and over again. The repetition is a little annoying, but it helps for memorization and emphasis.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dance Dance Revolution Extreme" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dance-dance-revolution-extreme">Dance Dance Revolution Extreme</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was a news story on a DDR "rave" event similar to the Beatmania "rave" event from a few years ago.</p><p>This DDR "rave" was pushed back to October 18th in Velfarre, Japan? Not the Japanese release of DDRextreme. So, actually this past Thursday, October 9th, DDRextreme was released. Hurrah! ^_^ And in addition to the initial releasings of DDRextreme, it included the DDRextreme Premium Disc, which is a soundtrack to DDRextreme. ^_^ Whoo hoo.. Free stuff. Free GOOD stuff. Unfortunately, this game was sent to my home in Minnesota, so it'll end up being an extra couple of days before I get it down in Platteville. Sigh... hopefully I'll get it before next weekend.</p><p>As for song information, DDRexteme has about 105 songs, which is more than any previous home version to date.

As well as a couple other challenging songs like Sakura, Vanity Angel, Xenon, Bag, and Cartoon Heroes new in DDR.</p><p>Though, it has the most songs in any home version to date, it can't contain everything that was in the arcade version of DDR extreme. The arcade machine contained every arcade DDR song to date. Many songs of which had new Oni steps that made the old songs with outdated stoic steps, have quicker and challenging steps. There also aren't the Oni only Max2 tracks featured in Max2 JP.</p><p>BUT HEY, can't have everything. ^_^ Unless I were to have the arcade board, or make Step Step Revolution or Dance with Intensity work on my computer, and then make the PS USB controller adapters work.</p><p>Anyways, this song list looks great. It's much better than DDR Max2 USA in my opinion. DDR Max2 USA kinda brings down the difficulty bar below DDR Max, where DDR Extreme had already brought the bar up higher before DDR Max2 USA was out.</p><p>And in other import gaming news, Gran Turimso Prologue is now available for reserve off ncsx.com, though I really don't think it'd be such a good idea to buy. Sure, it's Gran Turismo 4, which kicks ass. But, it's only one track, 3 modes of play, and a couple cars for $35. When the full version will probably be $80 and have well over 100 times the amount of stuff to do. I just gotta wait. ^_^ GT4 Prologue is too little. I can wait a few more months for the profound glory of GT4 JP. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fermat's Last Theorem" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fermats-last-theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 8, 2003 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) is probably the greatest amateur mathematician. He thought of mathematics much like a hobby. Early on in his career, he came to possess a copy of Diophantus' The Arithmetica. In his copy, he would scribble notes here and there in the margin. These were notes about theorems and then claims of his own. Every little claim that he made in this book was later proven to be true. (with the exception of his formula for prime numbers.)</p><p>Everything was proven except for one: Fermat's Last Theorem.</p><p><i>cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadratoquadratos, et generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos ejusdem nominis fas est diviere: cujus rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non capert.</i></p><p>(It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.)</p><p>If n>2, then a^n+b^n=c^n has no solutions in nonzero integers a, b, and c. This one proof hung around well after fermat's death in 1665 and was finally proven a little over ten years ago, on June 23, 1993 by Andrew Wiles of Princeton and Cambridge.</p><p>The story of Andrew Wiles is somewhat interesting. That's what we learned today in math history ^_^ . Throughout the course of the last 300 years of mathematicians attempting to solve the equation, no one ever got close at all. The most interesting thing about attempting to prove Fermat's Last Theorem was the mathematics that came out of it in order to prove it, like the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for example, which stated that elliptic curves were modular. This was the key to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. Willes went to prove Fermat through Taniyama-Shimura, then Taniyama-Shimura through Frey curves, then Frey curves through Galios representations... blah blah blah. I don't know the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210035334/http://www.mbay.net/~cgd/flt/flt08.htm" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210035334/http://www.mbay.net/~cgd/flt/flt08.htm">specifics</a>.</p><p>All of these mathematics were created, more or less, just to prove Fermat. Which raises the question: what the hell proof did Fermat have if mathematics of today had to change and grow in order to prove it. Crazy! Most people say he couldn't, and that he made it up. Even so, look at all of that Fermat inspired in mathematics. Or, maybe he didn't make it up and this guy proved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030406145541/http://www.coolissues.com/mathematics/Fermat/fermat.htm" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20030406145541/http://www.coolissues.com/mathematics/Fermat/fermat.htm">that</a>.</p><p>Anywho, that was today's very interesting lesson in math history. Tomorrow's colloquium is hosted by Jeske, who is going to talk about Pick's theorem.</p><p>Hopefully someday I'll fulfill that childhood dream of making a theorem of my own. Schlock's theorem of Geometric Explanation? Who knows.. Maybe i could just be like Fermat and 'make up' a whole bunch of crap and let everyone else prove it. Hell, that's how Frey curves came about. Interesting, no? Schlock curves.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cardano's Solution" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cardanos-solution">Cardano's Solution</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I felt lucky to take it, and it was very interesting going through the building blocks of modern day mathematics from a "math class" point of view, rather than the point of view of a "history class".</p><p>The paper answers the question, "Is Cardano's Solution a great theorem?"</p><p><i>Original Post</i>: And now for your reading pleasure: my math history paper that is due in 15 minutes:</p><div class='title'><b>Cardano's Solution, a Great Theorem</b></div><p>Is Cardano's 'solution of the cubic' a Great Theorem?  Cardano's solution to the cubic took great algebraic insight.  In the book, <i>Journey Through Genius</i>, William Dunham includes Cardano's proof, along with eleven other proofs as the greatest mathematical achievements of all time.  Each chapter in his books exhibits rigorous proofs of our modern notational methods of proving, but for the original mathematicians to prove these theorems, there was no notation.  Original proofs had geometry and just words to illustrate the methods of finding such answers.</p><p>So what makes a Great Theorem great?  Something that all the great theorems in Journey Through Genius clearly illustrate is mathematical genius not seen in their time.  Some of these mathematicians were so immersed in the problems, that it was a matter of time before they found the answer.  Others solved these problems because their process of thought saw the problem differently than everyone else.  Euclid's proof of the 'infinitude of primes' showed his concept of infinity, before anyone decided to conceptualize the name.</p><p>Archimedes' 'determination of circular area' showed his concept of infinity and limits well before their time.  Heron's 'area of triangular space' provided a drastically different approach to area than what was considered at the time.  After these proofs were available to all mathematics, conventional thought then changed as well.  So, where does Cardano's 'solution to the cubic' fit into this?</p><p>I can understand why Cardano's 'solution to the cubic' would be considered a weak Great Theorem.  By today's concept of mathematics Cardano's proof is extremely long, tedious, and doesn't work for all the solutions to the problem.  Cardano was limited by the tools of his time, therefore imaginary, and other possibly real answers could not be obtained by his proof.  Great Theorems aren't about how useful they are today, though.</p><p>A Great Theorem is something that redefined mathematical thought at the time; that changed history into the direction we are now.  Within the solution to the cubic, it took great insight to notice the substitution of x to y - b/3a would get rid of the squared term in the general equation.  It also took great resource skills to make expert use out of all the tools available to him.  This theorem influenced the thought of solving multiple polynomials, by reduction of the middle terms.  Cardano later solved the quadric in this manor.  Three hundred years later, this theorem brought about Abel's proof that you cannot exceed quadric equations through this method; a new method of solving must be devised.</p><p>I agree that Cardano's 'solution to the cubic' is a Great Theorem, because it influenced mathematics and brought about new ideas in their time.  William Dunham, in <i>Journey Through Genius</i>, doesn't give a specific definition of what a Great Theorem is, but he provides great information on how the mathematician came about his discovery and his proof.  From Dunham's example I think a Great Theorem is measured by its impact on the mathematical society, and the illustration through different mathematical thought.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/83">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/81">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
