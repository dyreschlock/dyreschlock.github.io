We arrived very early before his flight so he could get a PCR test and be cleared to fly. We walked around while waiting for the results, and I found a pretty amazing sight.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1386.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1386_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1386_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1386_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was a capsule machine that gave out miniature capsule machines! I absolutely had to have this thing. I got some change and turned the crank. My first pull gave me a pack of capsules! Pretty meta. I got a capsule ball full of tiny capsule balls. Well, now I needed to roll again to actually get a machine. My second pull was a success! I got the red version of the machine.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_1389_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Given all the moving parts of this little capsule machine, it was best to leave everything in its package for later.

A miniature capsule machine for my shelf.</p><p>Now that I had one, I needed to have them all! I searched for the set on the Internet and learned what I could. This particular set was called <span class='ja'>ガチャガチャマシーン</span>３ (or Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3), and it was released in December 2021. So, it was already out in the wild for 3 months. I learned that you can buy full distributions of some capsule times on Amazon.  For Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3 that consisted of 24 capsules, which was 3 complete sets of 8 items: 3 red machines, 3 white machines, 1 pack of capsules, and 1 set of metal shelves.  So, the Capsules I had gotten were a 1/8 rare pull. The red machine was a typical 3/8 pull.</p><p>I continued searching on Yahoo Auctions to find someone selling the missing items in my set, but most people were selling a full set of 8 or selling the rare pulls for a lot of money. Eh. I gave up. One capsule machine is good enough. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Update - March 2023</b></div><p>This has continued to nag at me over the last year. The other day, I was back on Yahoo Auctions looking around and I saw an auction for the two unique pieces of the set I was missing: the white capsule machine and a set of the shelving. It was only $10, so why not?</p><p>Not long after they arrived in the mail. The White capsule machine was in perfect condition, looking amazing and working well. The shelving was not. The piece had clearly been sitting in the sun for an extended period of time because the rods were warped. You can notice this in the photos below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0252_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220213_capsule/IMG_0256_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>When it sits on my shelf, you can't really notice.

I had already streamed some Playstation games using the native share method, but I wanted to stream Switch games, too.</p><p>I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer external capture card (after the Elgato one didn't work) and it worked pretty proficiently. OBS uses a lot of power when running, so I have to limit my streams to 720p or else the battery can't charge itself fast enough from all the power usage.</p><p>I streamed Let's Go Eevee almost daily for multiple hours. Unfortunately, Nintendo did not release end of the year stats as they did for previous years. :(</p><p>In July, I was finally able to order a Playstation 5. I had tried getting one in Japan, but there were so few shipments and retailers had many weird hoops to go through to get one. I got mine directly through Sony online in America, so I had my mom ship it to me, which was a little expensive. :( </p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p>With a Playstation 5, I started playing some more games on stream rather than just Pokemon. Although, every game I played was an enhanced version of a Playstation 4 game (or simply a Playstation 4 game). <b>Final Fantasy VII Remake</b> got a PS5 version. <b>Death Stranding</b> got a PS5 version.</p><p>The first game I played through on stream was <b>Control</b>, a some cerebral action-adventure set in a retro corporate setting. You play as Jesse, who is appointed as the new director of the FBC, and you tear through the depths of the vast headquarters looking for your brother and the secrets of the organization. It was neat, and free with PSN from a few months prior.</p><p>My absolute favorite game of the year was <b>Outer Wilds</b>. It's a very simple game where you play as an alien species on a small world. The sun will go super nova at the end of the day, and you explore all the planets and other locations of your solar system to discover the ancient history of your species, as well as find a way for life to survive the super nova. It's an incredible experience where you are given the tiniest spec of a hint at the beginning of what to do, and from there, everything is found through your own exploration and experimentation.</p><p>Anyways, here are my stats:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Even though Nintendo did not release play stats for the Switch, with the termination of the Wii U and 3DS online services, Nintendo did make a webpage where you could see your lifetime stats from both platforms.</p><p>Compared to the 900 hours I played on my Nintendo Switch last year, 1102 lifetime hours on the 3DS seems a bit low.

Each form is a letter of the alphabet, plus a question mark and exclamation point. Unown is special because it was originally only available at physical events. And at those events, only specific letters were available. Over time, it's become easier to catch at least one form of Unown, but certain letters have only been available a few times.</p><p>So, which letters are the most common? Which ones are rare? And where have they been released?</p><p>I've been keeping track on this page: <b><a href="/apps/pokemon/unown" title="/apps/pokemon/unown">/apps/pokemon/unown</a></b></p><p>This page shows the data in 4 ways:<br/>1. It shows which ones I'm missing and which events they were available at.<br/>2. It shows an ascending list of the rarest Unowns and their events from the last 3 years.<br/>3. It shows an ordered list of how many times each Letter has been available, and which events.<br/>4. And, it shows each individual event where Unown had been available, and which ones were there.</p><p>I use this page to determine whether or not I should throw away some Unown after I catch them. If I go to an event in Japan, and a particular form appears that has not appeared back in the US, I'll hold on to more than usual so I can trade with people.</p><p>The Exclamation Point, for example, was available at Go Fest in 2019, but has not been available since.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dune" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dune">Dune</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 2, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dune is like a dream. The film is told with subtle movements, occasionally abstract visuals, and ambient overwhelming music that guides you forward through the story. There are a few action sequences, but they serve more as a bullet point to the overall story being told.</p><p>It is directed by Denis Villenueve, who also directed Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, two of my absolute favorite films of the last few years. The motion picture score is done by Hans Zimmer, who wrote the music of Blade Runner 2049 and many Christopher Nolan films. While his Nolan scores are very similar, the music of Dune sets itself apart to build a dreamlike state.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Story of Dune</b></div><p>The story of Dune begins its focus on Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides and heir to their House. House Atreides has become strong in both political and military power within the houses of the known universe, so the Emperor decides to install them as fief of Arrakis, Dune, deposing House Harkonen. House Harkonen have a long hatred of the Atreides, and the Emperor uses this opportunity to push the Harkonens to wipeout House Atreides.</p><p>Paul is the son of Lady Jessica, a devout member of the Bene Gesserit, a secret order of women who train their bodies and minds to obtain superhuman abilities seen as magic to outsiders. Over centuries, they have carefully steered bloodlines of the powerful Houses of the universe to birth a human with the most powerful mental abilities ever seen. They believe this person would be able to control the known universe and bring everlasting peace. Lady Jessica gave birth to Paul in defiance of the order, giving him the seeds of this power. </p><p>Arrakis is the most politically important planet in the universe. The surface is covered in desert, and within the sands is a substance called spice. Spice is a powerful hallucinogen that will unlock a person's mind to its full capabilities. Genetically engineered and breed humans of the Spacing Guild use its power to unlock intergalactic space travel allowing humans to travel across galaxies. It is the most important and priceless substance in the universe. Those who control Arrakis harvest the spice and sell it within the universe's market, giving them immense wealth.</p><p>Prior to Paul's arrival on Arrakis, he has dreams showing his possible futures. On Arrakis, these dreams lead him to understanding the culture of native Arrakins known as Fremen. Spice opens and unlocks his mind to more dreams powerful and predictive. As his House is attacked and destroyed by the Harkonens, he and his mother are forced in the desert where the spice surrounds him. They find the Fremen and are accepted into their city.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Meaning of Dune</b></div><p>Dune 2021 is only Part 1 of a long long story that lasts thousands of years. It's doubtful that this movie series will actually make it that far, though. I think Villeneuve has said he only plans on adapting Paul's story, and not continuing the story of his children which continue into millennia. There is such a huge time gap, and it's somewhat disconnected from the purpose of the story, anyway.</p><p>Overall, the meaning and purpose of Dune is to show the consequences of faith and charismatic leadership.</p><p>The Bene Gesserit have seeded prophecy across the universe. Over generations, simple rumors and tales of a promised warrior destined to save their people from evil has turned into religion and faith. These religions consume planets and create populations of devote followers. All under the guise of the Bene Gesserit projecting themselves as deities.</p><p>The Arrakins and Fremen see Paul arrive on Dune and they see this prophet. Paul's interest and obsession of Arrakis as well as his mental conditioning allows him to quickly adapt and understand their culture. Arrakins confuse this as prophecy. All they have ever known is oppression and with the emergence of hope, they cling to it and force themselves and Paul into it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" /></p><p>Spoilers, but this will be the center-piece of Dune Part 2. Continuing with further spoilers, ultimately, this holy crusade is inevitable and worlds worth of people and civilizations die as a result. That'll be Dune Part 3, which I hope to god they are able to make.</p><div class='title'><b>The Weight of Responsibility</b></div><p>Something Dune Part 1 does exceedingly well is show how Paul takes reluctant responsibility. There have been many stories of reluctant heroes, and they always whine about not wanting to do what they have to do. Paul states at the beginning that he does not want to lead.</p><p>With the death of his father, he is now Duke Atreides. He doesn't try to ignore his potential political power as head of his House. He thinks of ways of how to use it to turn the situation into his favor. He accepts his responsibility.</p><p>In the final act of the film, a Fremen warrior forces him into combat where the victor is determined by the death of the other. Paul easily outmatches him, but attempts to find a middle ground having never actually killed before. While other stories would have the hero give up or whine about it, Paul understands that he must kill. And so he does.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" /></p><p>This death weighs on him. Yes, it's his first kill, but it's also the first direct casualty on his path forward. A path that he is forced to take and he will not back down from. He confirms this by saying that his road leads into the desert, not off world. He takes responsibility for what he must do, but also feels the weight of it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Design of Dune</b></div><p>While the story subtly builds, the design and music become the most dynamic parts of the film. The technology and structures of Dune are never explained in the film, so we're presented with vehicles and tools that appear to work like magic, their shapes often abstract. Many shots in the film show their immense scale. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" /></p><p>The size of a single person cannot even be measured against these enormous objects.

Prior to the film's release, Hans Zimmer released <b>The Dune Sketchbook</b>, which featured music from the movie but presented them in a meandering build, like he was trying to find the sound from his ideas, like an artist uses a sketchbook. As such, some tracks are very even and don't really work together as a complete album.</p><p>A few weeks later, <b>Dune The Motion Picture Soundtrack</b> was released. This album had 22 tracks of score that was directly included in the film. No extras or changes like the Sketchbook. However, tracks that were extended in the Sketchbook were not included in the Soundtrack. </p><p>After the movie was released, I combined both albums together to create a more complete musical journey analogous to the build of the film. Some sketchbook tracks didn't work as they were too uneven, so I put Moon Over Caladan first, and removed Song of the Sisters. If you did include Sone of the Sisters, it would go after The One, but I think it breaks up the movement from the Gom Jabbar to Leaving Caladan. It also has redundant sounds from Bene Gesserit.</p><p>Here is my arranged tracklisting combining both albums.</p><p class='img'><table class="tracklisting"><tr><td class="number">1.</td><td class="title">Moon Over Caladan</td><td class="notes">The Dune Sketchbook — Track 6</td></tr><tr><td class="number">2.</td><td class="title"> Dream of Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">3.</td><td class="title"> Herald of the Change </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">4.</td><td class="title">I See You in My Dreams</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">5.</td><td class="title"> Bene Gesserit </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">6.</td><td class="title"> Gom Jabbar </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">7.</td><td class="title"> The One </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">—</td><td> Song of the Sisters </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">8.</td><td class="title">Paul's Dream</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">9.</td><td class="title"> Leaving Caladan </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 6 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">10.</td><td class="title"> House Atreides </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">11.</td><td class="title"> Arrakeen </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">12.</td><td class="title"> Ripples in the Sand </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">13.</td><td class="title"> The Shortening of the Way </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">14.</td><td class="title"> Visions of Chani </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 9 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">15.</td><td class="title"> Night on Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 10 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">16.</td><td class="title"> Armada </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 11 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">17.</td><td class="title"> Burning Palms </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 12 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">18.</td><td class="title"> Stranded </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 13 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">19.</td><td class="title"> Blood for Blood </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 14 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">20.</td><td class="title"> The Fall </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 15 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">21.</td><td class="title"> Holy War </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 16 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">22.</td><td class="title"> Sanctuary </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 17 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">23.</td><td class="title"> Premonition </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 18 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">24.</td><td class="title"> Ornithopter </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 19 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">25.</td><td class="title"> Sandstorm </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 20 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">26.</td><td class="title"> Shai-hulud </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">27.</td><td class="title"> Stillsuits </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 21 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">28.</td><td class="title"> Mind Killer </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">29.</td><td class="title"> My Road Leads into the Desert </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 22 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">30.</td><td class="title"> Grains of Sand </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 9 </td></tr></table>A third album was released to accompany an art book, <b>The Art and Soul of Dune</b>. All of these tracks are ambient versions of music already included in the previous two albums. It's meant as a background accompaniment as you read and view the content of the book. Overall, because they're too ambient and usually redundant, they don't really fit into my arrangement.<b>The Lore of Dune</b>Dune has always been a story and world that many people have considered impossible to adapt (yet this is the third adaptation). After watching the 1984 film and 2000 television mini-series, it seems like it's pretty easy to adapt. Although, both productions are severely flawed. Also, I've never read the book, so I don't know what I'm talking about.Apparently the books are incredibly dense with lore that would completely slow down and obscure any movie or TV show. Watching videos on YouTubes and reading about Dune online, completes the picture for me as Dune 2021 skips over A LOT of stuff.Prior to watching to watching Dune 2021 in theaters, I didn't know anything about the story or lore of Dune. What I had seen before, I had completely forgotten. But, I was still able to understand character motivations and what everyone was doing. The story in Dune 2021 is presented well enough that you don't need encyclopedic knowledge of the source material. On the reverse side, if you have this encyclopedic knowledge, I think it only enhances what is going on.You don't need to know that humans have completely rejected computers and robots, and that people have been engineered, trained, and conditioned into biological thinking computers, called <I>mentats</I>. That's what this guy is, by the way.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" />The movie doesn't tell you that Paul has also been trained as a mentat, which gives him the ability to learn about Arrakis and the Fremen incredibly quickly.Everything you need to know about the overall lore of Dune is hinted at or mentioned briefly. Despite not giving you enough information, the movie respects the viewer enough to make those connections in the future, or review the source material to confirm your connections.<b>The Future of Dune</b>The end of Dune Part 1 is the most jarring part of the film. There's no real ending to the film at all. It just stops. I suppose this was alluded to at the beginning when the full title of the film "Dune Part 1" was revealed. It makes sense as this is a single part of an overall story, but it's still jarring. Dune Part 2 will continue directly where Part 1 ends. And I expect Dune Part 3 will be the conclusion of Paul Atreides story. Denis Villeneuve has professed in interviews that he is a lifelong fan of Dune, and it has always been his dream to create a series of motion pictures that perfectly capture and encapsulate the story of Paul Atreides. I imagine that we will get a complete trilogy of Paul's story. But, the further story of his children may or may not be told.I imagine that Villeneuve will probably move on to something else after three Dune films, but the greedy studio will push ahead with Children of Dune. I suppose that is our problem in the future to deal with.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" />I eagerly anticipate what will come in the future.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Edge of Tomorrow" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/edge-of-tomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Ultimately, its low marketing budget and audience's saturation of mindless sci-fi action led to its poor box office returns, labeling it a bomb. But, this film is very underrated and under-appreciated, and it's a shame.</p><p>The overall story focuses on a single decisive battle between humanity against an invaded alien horde conquering most of Europe. Loss of this battle will result in the loss of the planet and life on Earth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tom Cruise is the star of the film, which both helps and hurts the film. One year prior, Tom Cruise starred in Oblivion, which wasn't that great. I think the reception of that film hurt this one quite a bit because people didn't want to see another stinker. At the time, I think Tom Cruise was seen as very humorless and self-serious because of viral clips online. But, his ideas created a lot of the humor and light-hearted situations in this film.</p><div class='title'><b>William Cage</b></div><p>Tom Cruise portrays William Cage, the head of an advertising firm forced to join humanity's army because of his ROTC training in college. He is a coward and does marketing in the guise of journalism for the army to sway humanity's trust into their war efforts. To avoid battle, at the beginning of the film, he tries to blackmail the leading general of the frontline to avoid going to combat. He's arrested and thrown into the army with the new recruits.</p><p>While training with the new recruits, he doesn't know how to operate his weapons, he tries to run away from battle, and tries to convince others to get him out. In the battle, he squadmates are killed by alien enemies, known as Mimics, while he avoids getting hurt. As a final act, before the enemy kills him, he grabs a claymore mine and sacrifices himself as he blows away the enemy towering over him. Dead.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage awakes the previous morning, alive.

The goal of this class is for students to become more familiar with listening to and speaking native English with correct feelings and expressions. The majority of the class focuses on listening. Students will get a script with various words missing from the dialogue. While listening and watching the scene, they'll fill in the blanks with what's missing. We'll also go through the meaning so students can keep up with the story.</p><p>These listening activities lead to Performance Tests. Rather than doing a final Listening Test for the unit, students will make pairs and perform a scene from the film. Students will not only memorize and say the correct dialogue, but must act the scene with correct expression and feelings with their voice, face, eyes, and body.</p><p>The first performance test is when Cage meets Rita on the battlefield after days of trying to save her. From his actions, she realizes and understands Cage's situation. She throws down her weapon, and exclaims, "Find me when you wake up." Cage confused by the response replies, "What?" Rita, one more time clearly orders, "Come find me when you wake up," and they're both killed by an explosion.</p><p>Because the dialogue is so short, students exchange roles. My grading mainly focuses on the student performing as Rita. Cage's response is important to support Rita's dialogue, but ultimately it's Rita's dialogue that is key to this scene. Students must make a distinction between how the dialogue is said first compared to the second time when it is so clear, without any misunderstanding.</p><p>Again, check the <a href="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow">course page</a> for the full performance criteria, as well as worksheets.</p><div class='title'><b>Defeating the Mimics</b></div><p>Following orders, Cage ditches his squad during training to find Rita during her training. He tells her about what's happening, and she understands. She tells him that she used to have the power to reset time, and she used to win the battle at Verdun. She lost the battle when she was wounded and a medic transfused her blood.</p><p>Both of them go to meet Dr. Carter, played by Noah Taylor, a scientist who had previous helped Rita during the Battle of Verdun and understands how the Mimics operate. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Mimics operate as a single entity. The normal orange enemies are the Drones. They operate as an unthinking appendage of the horde. Killing them has no real effect. The larger blue enemies are the Alphas. These act as the enemy's eyes, ears, and nerves. When killed, an alpha sends a signal to the brain, which is called the Omega. When the Omega receives this signal, it restarts the day and corrects its course to victory.</p><p>On the first day, Cage killed an Alpha, but Cage was covered in the Alpha's blood. By absorbing the Alpha's blood, he also absorbed the Omega's power of resetting the day. When Cage dies, the Omega resets the day, and everything starts again.</p><p>To win the war, the Omega must be killed. Cage and Rita train together to make Cage mentally strong enough to kill the Mimics. Each day, Carter searches for the location of the Omega. As Carter gets closer to finding the Omega, Cage and Rita work on a strategy for plowing through the battlefield and reaching the location of the Omega.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Second Performance</b></div><p>After days and days of dying and little progress each day, Cage and Rita make it to a farmhouse miles inland from the battle.

They convince Cage's squad to join them, and they fight through hordes of drones without the safety of being able to die and try again. The Omega seems to be throwing all of its troops against them, almost as if it knows that they are coming.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Rita and Cage make it to the Omega after each of Cage's squad members are killed off.

With the enemy destroyed and inert, the war is over and the battle is no longer necessary. All of his squad members are alive having never entered battle. Rita, too. The film ends with Cage meeting Rita at the base.</p><div class='title'><b>Morals</b></div><p>There are several morals to be learned from the film that I like to imbue on students. The first moral or lesson is the importance of repetition and continuous efforts towards your goal. Winning the entire war seemed absolutely impossible at the beginning of the film, but it was through Cage's reluctant yet continuous efforts that he gained the confidence and knowledge needed to win.</p><p>Additionally, he was not successful on his first attempt or even his fiftieth attempt. Cage constantly experienced failure and learned from his failures every day to progress further and further to eventually achieve victory. These efforts ultimately rewarded him with the ability to know what to do in an unknown situation when he no longer had the ability to reset the day at the end.</p><p>Also, through all of his daily failures, he showed his bravery. In the beginning, he was a coward who would do anything to run away from battle and danger. But, even on his first day, he showed bravery by killing himself to destroy the Alpha. That small showing of bravery gave him this power, and each day he showed more bravery trying to save his squad mates, and save Rita, too.</p><p>One of the key quotes in the film is <b>"Battle is the Great Redeemer."</b> Battle shows a person who they truly are as they shed whatever person they were in society. Cage was ultimately victorious because, at heart, he was courageous and brave. When pushed to the ultimate limit, what kind of person are you, really?</p><p>All morals are important for life, and the film shows this through Cage's journey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Original Script Ending</b></div><p>The finished film we received has a pretty happy ending overall, and doesn't necessarily play by its rules at the end. The whole film Cage always goes back to the base. But now, just to wrap everything up in a nice bow, he goes back to before he dishonored himself with the general, escaping punishment. His overall sacrifice ended up rewarding him with a happy ending.</p><p>The original script was not so kind. Leading to the final battle, it seemed like the Omega knew they were coming. One of Cage's squad mates even yells this out, "They know we're coming, man!" This is because, in the original script, in this battle previously, they had killed an Alpha. Killing an Alpha resets the day, but anyone outside of the Omega living that day wouldn't know it. </p><p>The Omega knows they are coming, and kills them all off one by one. The Mimics take over the Earth, and humanity is lost.</p><p>Tom Cruise and the production crew did not like this ending for several reasons. Thematically, it didn't really fit with the direction of the story towards the end. It didn't make sense for Cage to learn everything and grow, just to be killed in the end. Also, it wouldn't balance the overall feelings of the film. There are some comedic moments, but everything is so tense. There needs to be some relief. And, we've seen everyone die over and over again throughout the film that seeing more death wouldn't really have the weight to it.</p><p>I think they made the right choice.</p><div class='title'><b>Novel Differences and Ending</b></div><p>Edge of Tomorrow is adapted from a Japanese "light" novel entitled, <b>All You Need Is Kill</b>, by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It has since been adapted to a manga, too. There are some key differences in the story that lead to a different ending than both movie versions. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The biggest overall difference in the story which leads to many other story differences is that there's a fourth Mimic type. In addition to Drones, Alphas, and the Omega, there are also <b>Antennas</b>. For every Alpha, there is an Antenna, and the Antennas receive the signals sent from the Alpha to trigger the Omega to restart the day. For Rita and Cage to destroy the Omega, they must first destroy all of the Antennas, and then the Omega.</p><p>In the end, Cage and Rita (actually his name isn't Cage in this, but it doesn't matter) eventually destroy every Antenna and land the final blow on the Omega. But, the day resets. Even killing all the Antenna didn't work. This was because an Antenna still existed.</p><p>Much like Edge of Tomorrow, Rita had previously gained the time power from fighting in Verdun. But, when she lost the power, she didn't lose it completely. She became an Antenna and Cage is her Alpha. All Antenna must be killed. So, after killing all other Antenna, Cage and Rita face each other, and Cage delivers the final blow. He then destroys the Omega, ending the war.</p><p>Out of the three endings, I like this one the best. Rita can finally make her sacrifice that she decided on earlier. She's able to join everyone who died with her at Verdun, and the rest of the world is able to survive the Mimic invasion.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>Even with these three endings, people online have come up with lots of other ideas for endings. Also, recently (2024), there have been talks with Tom Cruise and Warner Bros to make a possibly sequel. With such a happy ending, there is still room to have more time shenanigans. So, how will they continue the story? What could they do?</p><p>Concluding class, I ask students to come up with a premise for the sequel.</p><p>One of the more creative endings from fans was Cage still retaining the time power from the Omega. After living his life with Rita, Cage finally dies of old age. But then, he wakes up back at the beginning of the final battle only to live his life again. The film could revolve around Cage becoming a bit of a demigod with the time power warping him. Ultimately, Cage has to figure out how to truly die.</p><p>Overall, <b>Edge of Tomorrow</b> is an incredible film. It's one of my strongest classes that revolve around a film. There's so much good in the film. This post is pretty long, and I never even talked about <b>Bill Paxton's</b> incredible performance as Master Sergeant Ferill. </p><p>I already spoiled the whole movie, but if you've made it this far without seeing it, you've gotta see it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the most beloved and revered spinoffs of Pokemon is Pokemon Snap for Nintendo 64. The idea of roaming around in a land while wild Pokemon "naturally" interact with each other and the environment has always given reality to people's imagination of how the real world of Pokemon could be.</p><p>For years, people have always said that they should make a modern update to Pokemon Snap and they finally did. Release on April 30th, <b>New</b> Pokemon Snap is the modern update every one had been asking for.</p><p>Back on the Nintendo 64, only 151 Pokemon were available, but 20 years later, there are now over 900 Pokemon. This game doesn't have all 900, but it has an incredibly balanced variety of Pokemon from all the different generations. It's pretty amazing how much New Pokemon Snap doesn't focus on just one generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>New Pokemon Snap plays almost identically to the original. You character hops into a pod and is pulled through the world on a mostly linear track. Your job is to take photos of Pokemon that appear in the environment. </p><p>Through the game, you unlock some ways to interact with the Pokemon. In New Pokemon Snap, you can throw out food for them to eat, throw orbs to light up pokemon, and play music. These interactions can change the course of your pod, or unlock other things.</p><p>Expanded from the original is the possibility of different tiered photographs. Depending on the interactions you before with Pokemon, they could perform a unique pose or even a special pose.  Every Pokemon now has 4 level of photographs to be taken. Tier 1 is a stand photo and Tier 2 is typically the Pokemon eating food. Tier 3 and Tier 4 are reserved for unique poses</p><p>With 200 total Pokemon in the game and each Pokemon having 2 unique poses, that's 400 unique photographs you need to take. It is a bit overwhelming, especially towards the end of the game when you're missing many of these photos. When you only get 1 or 2 new photos in a single run, it gets VERY repetitive and VERY boring quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>High Score</b></div><p>All photos in the game give you a score. If you get a "perfect" photo, it'll be worth 4000 or more points. All of these points add up to the total score of your Photodex. Pokemon Snap came out right at the beginning of Golden Week, so I had an entire week off from work to devote to this game. I was playing this game almost every day for HOURS after its release, so I was flying through the game.</p><p>Additionally, you can connect online and compare your Photodex score to everyone in the world. At my peak, I was able to become nearly 800th place in the world.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I could not keep up this pace forever. Vacation had finished, and I had to get back to work. Everyone else in the world who played video game for a living continue on without me.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnout</b></div><p>As mentioned above, once you do the broad strokes of everything in the game, all that is left is grinding. Finding all of the remaining photos, one by one. Slowly increasing the scores of your photos, one by one. Doing the same tracks, again and again and again. </p><p>There's not really much skill involved with the game. You wait 5 minutes to get the perfect photo, and if you miss it by a fraction of a second, you gotta do it again.  You try to get Pokemon to do what you want, but it occasionally goes wrong, and gets frustrating.</p><p>Eh, there's really no reason to push myself too hard in this game just to build my hatred for it. It's a good game and I like it, otherwise.</p><p>So, I put the game down. Here are my final stats in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it's a fun game with a lot of stuff to do. The Pokemon interactions are fun and interesting. Plenty of Easter eggs and hidden interactions to find that are really satisfying when you naturally find them.  Definitely worthy of the Pokemon Snap name. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock Bot" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>With the world in lockdown, late last year I decided to look into what it would take to start streaming video games on the Internet. I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer from Amazon, and after a lot of tweaks, I have my stream running pretty well through OBS and broadcasting to Twitch. I've had a small following, too, so I've made a Discord to chat with people while I'm not streaming.</p><p>You can find me on Twitch here: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock">https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock</a><br/>You can join my Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK">https://discord.gg/...</a></p><p>These days I've been playing a lot of Let's Go Eevee on stream. In each stream, I hunt for Shiny pokemon and eventually I plan on collecting all of them. In order to make my streams more engaging, I have created a Chat Bot that has various games and activities. This is <b>Schock Bot</b>.</p><p>Schlock Bot is a locally run program. When it is active, it'll connect to Twitch and Discord. It will read every message in the Twitch chat and every message in the Bot channel on Discord. If a command appears, it will respond. It is written in Java with connections to MySQL. Recently, I retro-fitted Tapestry into it, so it will also host webpages, which I use as Twitch overlays.</p><p>On Git-hub, you can view all the current functionality and how to use it. For Twitch Chat, its main function is taking bets on which Shiny Pokemon will appear next in Let's Go. Also, there's a guessing game, which will give the Chat hints on a Pokemon. The first one to guess will get points!</p><p>You can view the entire project here: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot">https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot</a></p><p>It's been really fun getting back into programming. It is really satisfying that while building this thing everything really came together. And then being able to use it immediately on stream and have real people interact with it. It's great. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Plans</b></div><p>Rock blocks are always what slows down progress and kills motivation, though. Nearly everything I've been able to think of, I've been able to put into this, but there are 2 major things I wish to add that have not been working.</p><p><b>One</b>, I want to be able to listen for Channel Points redemptions and other Twitch notifications. Apparently you do this through Web hooks, but I haven't been able to get it working. With this working, I could automate a few things in the background rather than doing it manually.</p><p><b>Two</b>, I have Schlock Bot hosting web pages, which are connected in Twitch and displayed. But, again, I'm manually turning on and off their visibility. I want to make a host of other webpages that show the most recent followers and display graphics or play sound effects. I'm having trouble getting these pages working. There would need to be some kind of Ajax thing that would listen for a prompt, and then react accordingly.</p><p>With both of these things working, viewers could redeem points and have graphics show up on my stream or have a sound effect play.  Ya know, just like all the other obnoxious streamers.  Some day, this'll happen.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Most Played Games in 2020" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/most-played-games-2020">Most Played Games in 2020</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 20, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Legend of Crystania is a film that has had a significant impact on me. Unlike any of movie, it wasn't because of the story, characters, art, or music. It was because, 14 years ago, my college friends and I and over 25 members of our college anime club, SPAMM, created a feature length fandub of the film. To this day, I have yet to know anything about the official story or characters other than it's connection to Lodoss War.</p><p>Our film was entitled The Secret of Crystania, and you can view it here: <br/><b><a href="/old/v7/the-secret-of-crystania" title="/the-secret-of-crystania">theschlock.com/the-secret-of-crystania</a></b></p><p>Every since moving to Japan, I often go to Yahoo Auctions and when I'm there, I always search for Crystania. Over the last 10 years, many pieces of Crystania memorabilia has surfaced. Usually the prices are very cheap compared to well known anime productions of the time, so buying these things has worked on quite well. Recently, some very interesting things has shown up there, too.</p><p>I have scanned in all of my memorabilia, and you can take a look at it all below.</p><div class='title'><b>Theatrical Run Items</b></div><p>The Legend of Crystania premiered in Japanese theaters during the Tsunogawa Anime Festival on July 29th, 1995. It was part of a double feature along with the Slayers movie. Obviously, Slayers was incredibly popular, so people were basically suckered into seeing Crystania, too.</p><p>I have found a ticket from that event, which has a March 27th, 1995 date on it for some reason. Were they selling tickets that far in advance? Looking around all tickets have that date on them. I don't know why.</p><p>Additionally, I found a flyer for the premiere event as well as a film pamphlet. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0728_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As films release in Japan, theaters will sell a pamphlet book of the film with shots from the film, story explanation, and occasionally production notes, interviews, and other behind the scenes stuff. This particular book also has several pages of ads for additional Crystania mechandise. Most of the time these books are sold, but maybe these were given away with the premiere. I've scanned the pamphlet and the flyer and included them below.</p><p>Legend of Crystania - Film Pamphlet (20 pages)<br/><span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span> <span class='ja'>パンフレット</span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm/">https://drive.google.com/.../1c8g83Hvg7Z6VQ0-c5SMrJeXM-NJNapjm</a></p><p>Slayers / Legend of Crystania Premiere Flyer<br/><span class='ja'>スレイヤーズ</span> <span class='ja'>はじまりの冒険者たち　レジェンド・オブ・クリスタニア</span> <span class='ja'>映画</span> <span class='ja'>チラシ</span><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy/">https://drive.google.com/.../1gUuA27jhyLwaO5PghHqRcZ9o8R2MX5Hy</a></p><div class='title'><b>Home Release Items</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0576_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original home release of Legend of Crystania was on VHS in Japan on March 8th, 1996. But, it was a decaying format and LaserDisc was the new hotness. LaserDisc took an incredible hold in Japan and almost all the modern popular anime releases got a LaserDisc release through the late 90s. The LaserDisc version of Crystania was released on March 23rd, 1996, and by the end of the year, the 3-part 6-episode OAV sequel was released on LaserDisc, too.</p><p>The LaserDisc version of Legend of Crystania is the most high quality release to date. In America, we got a DVD version in 2000, but the DVD version released by ADV was a transfer of the LaserDisc. Additionally, the American DVD has subtitles and other English edits burned directly onto the video. This cuts out some of the original video.</p><p>I picked up two copies of the movie as they weren't too expensive.</p><p>The VHS tape shows up on Yahoo Auctions from time to time, but I think it's unnecessary to own since the LaserDisc is the definitive version.</p><div class='title'><b>Animation Cels</b></div><p>Around 7 years ago, as I was looking through Yahoo Auctions, I first searched for Crystania and saw that some was selling animation cels. I had always dreamed or had a fantasy of owning animation cels of Crystania, but owning such things seemed incredible cost prohibited in my mind, considering cels of popular shows go for hundreds of dollars.  </p><p>Luckily, Crystania is not popular, nor even really all that good. I purchased my first cels and posted about it here: <a href="/old/v7/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania" title="/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania">theschlock.com/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania</a>.</p><p>The years went on, and occasionally more and more cels would appear on Yahoo Auctions. Today, I own 15 cels from the film. I have scanned them all, and added them in the gallery below.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/crystania_memorabilia/IMG_0570_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Production Collections</b></div><p>Recently, these two items appeared on Yahoo Auctions and I immediately put all of my money behind acquiring them.

| March 27, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There are two major goals of Pokemon as the original theme song of the anime states: (1) <I>To catch them is my real test</I> and (2) <I>To train them is my cause</I>. For many people, battling (number 2) is their most favorite thing about pokemon. They build up their best pokemon, and battle online or battle their friends. Catching every Pokemon in the game (number 1) has always been my real goal.</p><p>In Pokemon games, the Pokedex (perhaps short for Pokemon Rolodex or Pokemon Index) is a complete list of all Pokemon available in the game. Whenever you caught a specie of Pokemon, it is registered in your Pokedex as being caught. When the Pokedex is complete, you have essentially caught every Pokemon in the game. Once complete, you will receive a diploma detailing your accomplishment. :)</p><p>To catch Pokemon, you usually just find them out in the wild. Over time with more and more Pokemon added to the mythos, it no longer became feasible to have every single Pokemon available in the wild. As such, the Pokédexes were split between Regional dexes and the National dex. The National Pokedex is a complete list of all Pokemon, and the Regional Pokedex is the list of all Pokemon available in that particular game.</p><p>If certain Pokemon weren't available in the game, then you would have to either migrate Pokemon from a previous game or trade from another game in the same generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Completing the National Pokedex for the first time</b></div><p>Back in <a href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete" title="/pokedex-nearly-complete">December 2014</a>, I wrote about how I was close to completing my life-long goal of collecting every single Pokemon. In Pokemon White, my National Dex was at 647 out of 649, and for Pokemon X/Y and ORAS, I was at 717 and 716 out of 720.</p><p>A few months later, I was able to catch the few remaining Pokemon I needed.</p><p>In Pokemon White, I bought a used copy of Pokemon Black 2. That save file already completed the game and has a Meloetta and Latios on there. I transferred them over, and was able to get my Diploma for completing the dex. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Pokemon White</b> and Generation 5 was complete.</p><p>I migrated both Pokemon forward to Pokemon X/Y, which were both missing in my games.

Most recently, Generation 8 has begun with the release of Pokemon Sword and Shield in Nov 2019.  As of today, there are 890 total Pokemon across all games. </p><p>Unfortunately, the National Pokedex is being phased out due to the unsustainable amount of Pokemon.  Previously, Pokemon Sun and Moon were the first games to no longer include the National Pokedex. And now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are the first to actually no even allow many Pokemon from previous generations. In both games, you could only complete the Regional dex.</p><p>Not including the National Pokedex in both games completely killed off my enjoyment of those games. I really just sped through them, beat 'em, and moved on. I did not linger nearly as long as I did with Pokemon X/Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (ORAS).</p><div class='title'><b>The Modern National Pokedex</b></div><p>Pokemon Sword and Shield were released missing A LOT of features available in previous generations. Besides the National Dex, the most notable missing feature was the GTS, Global Trade System, which allowed players to easily trade which Pokemon they wanted.</p><p>Last month, they feature were released in <b>Pokemon Home</b>. This is an online database where you can store all of your Pokemon. It can be accessed from your Nintendo Switch and from your Phone. On your Phone, you're able to access the GTS, where you can trade any Pokemon you have in your Home account. You can organize all of your Pokemon, too. There are also many collection and trade challenges that will give you achievements and stickers when you complete them.</p><p>But, within Pokemon Home, the National Pokedex had returned.</p><p>From previous generations on the Nintendo 3DS, you could migrate your Pokemon forward using Pokemon Bank, a similar service on the 3DS. And with currently released Pokemon games on the Switch, you could grab Pokemon from them.</p><p>On the Nintendo 3DS, I began moving Pokemon from Pokemon X and Omega Ruby into Pokemon Bank, and then into Pokemon Sun and Moon and also Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. I didn't take too long to collect the remaining Pokemon I was missing from both games to complete the <b>Alola Regional Dex</b> in both games.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>All of my Pokemon from all of my previous games were moved into Pokemon Bank, and then migrated to Pokemon Home.

It did not take long to transfer over the previous Pokemon and catch new ones.</p><p>In August 2020, I was able to complete the <b>Isle of Armor Regional Pokedex</b>, and in October 2020, I could complete the <b>Crown Tundra Regional Pokedex</b>.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b></div><p><I>Update! February 2022</I></p><p>Pokemon Legends is a reimagining of the Sinnoh region (generation 4) as your character is thrown into the past when Pokemon were first being discovered and Pokemon technology was being invented. Pokeballs had just been invented, and you join a clan whose purpose it is to discover and catalog ever Pokemon species in the region.</p><p>This game felt tailor-made for me. Finally there was a Pokemon game whose sole purpose was the complete the Pokedex. Also, the gameplay was incredibly fresh for the franchise. You no longer had to battle Pokemon to catch them. You could simply sneak up behind them and throw a ball. You could dodge attacks, and move around. When you did battle Pokemon, battles happened right where you were. There was no separate battle screen. Everything in the game was open. I played this game day in and day out after its release. I wanted to explore everywhere and catch everything.</p><p>Upon completion of the Pokedex, you weren't awarded a Diploma or anything. I mean, you were the first to ever complete the Pokedex (lore-wise) so they wouldn't have had any Diplomas laying around. But, they did have an awards ceremony.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_speech.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_speech.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_speech_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_speech_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_speech_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_charm.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_charm.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_charm_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_charm_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_charm_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_dex.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_dex.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_dex_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_dex_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2202_gen8_legends_dex_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</b></div><p><I>Update! November 2022</I></p><p>So soon after the release of Pokemon Legends came the new generation of pokemon, Scarlet and Violet. SV were completely open games like Pokemon Legends. You could explore wherever you wanted. And now, you could complete the story in whatever order you wanted, too. Although, there was still a hint of linear progression. As you completed Titans, you could glide around the environment, jump higher, and climb mountains. Pokemon hid themselves in all manor of places throughout the region.</p><p>I absolutely devoured this game. Exploration is one of the most interesting things for me in games, and being able to find new things in a vast open world and collect them kept me playing this game for hours upon hours after its release. Luckily, it came out during test week, so I had a lot of free time.</p><p>Much like Sword and Shield, the Paldea regional dex has 400 Pokemon, with over 100 of them completely new for generation 9. And much like Pokemon Legends, going into and out of battles was very fast. Catching Pokemon was very fast, too.  It started to become clear that completing the Pokedex would just be a matter of putting in the work rather than having to grind out tons of levels and evolutions. So many Quality of Life features have been added over the years, that it went pretty quickly.</p><p>Only a week after the release of Scarlet and Violet, I had completed the <b>Paldea Regional Pokedex</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2211_gen9_violet.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2211_gen9_violet.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2211_gen9_violet_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2211_gen9_violet_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2211_gen9_violet_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Future, again</b></div><p>More expansions have been announced for Scarlet and Violet, and I'm sure each of the new sub-regions will have their own Pokédexes.
