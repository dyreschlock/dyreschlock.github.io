It's so difficult to learn because nearly every aspect of the language is different. The words, the grammar, the ideas, the culture, and the way Japanese is used all differ from English. </p><p>In fact, the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" title="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">Foreign Service Institute</a> classifies Japanese as a Category IV language, which requires a minimum of 2200 hours of class time (88 weeks of 5-hour daily training) to achieve a General Professional Proficiency level. It is the Institute's high ranking, shared only by Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.</p><p>The best way to learn Japanese, and any language, is to be immersed in the language. Have daily contact with the language, and try to find a balance of using all four or five methods of communicating with a language. These four methods are: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Sometimes, people break speaking into two methods: speaking written or prepared words and speaking your own improvised thoughts. Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing is also the order of difficulty of performing them.</p><div class='title'><b>Listening</b></div><p>By being in Japan, listening becomes a daily routine. However, it can be easy to shut everything out and ignore what it said around you. In your native country listening to your native language, you can hear and understand everything around you. You are part of the public consciousness. In a foreign country with a foreign language, you're no longer able to naturally understand everything. You have to work at it. And work is often exhausting, which makes it easy to tune out others.</p><p>There's a lot to understand, and it's possible that there's some things that you'll never understand. But, as time goes on, you will have the ability to understand some things, and be able to connect dots to understand things. If you get in the habit of tuning out others, you rob yourself of the ability to naturally understand your surroundings. So, don't tune out too much. Make attempts at understanding.</p><p>When you hear common phrases, or sometimes when people talk with you. Try repeating what they say. This may seem stupid, but this is how babies naturally begin to learn languages. Which, also may seem stupid for you. Of course, as adults, we can also learn the rules of the languages and compare them with our own language. The combination of these two things will allow use to learn the language.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>Listening becomes the easiest method of communication in Japan because you have so many passive opportunities to practice. Writing is the most difficult because you are not only outputting what you know of the language, but you have to activity do it to get better at it. It takes the most work and time out of the others.</p><p>Unlike English with its 26 letters (or 52, including both upper and lowercase alphabets), Japanese uses three sets of alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana have 46 characters each. Kanji, on the other hand, has over 10,000. Although, there are hundreds or thousands of kanji that are outdated. High School graduates are expected to know the most common 2,000. The Genki books only go through about 320.</p><p>All three of these alphabets are used together. Take a look at this sentence:</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span></p></p><p>The first two characters are <span class='ja'>ジム</span>, katakana. Katakana is almost exclusively used for foreign words in the Japanese language. Both Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, so each of the characters have specific sounds that are said the exact same way wherever they are in the sentence, with a few exceptions. <span class='ja'>ジム</span> is my name, Jim, which is phonetically spelled.</p><p>The next two characters are <span class='ja'>先生</span>, kanji. In sentences, kanji are used for solid words, such as Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives. In this sentence, we have 3 words using kanji: <span class='ja'>先生</span>, <span class='ja'>店</span>, and <span class='ja'>行く</span>. <span class='ja'>先生</span> is <i>sensei</i>, or teacher. Combined with my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生</span>, it's used as a suffix to denote that I'm a teacher. Generally, non-casually, when referring to other people, you use a suffix with their name. <span class='ja'>店</span> is <i>mise</i>, or store. And, <span class='ja'>行く</span> is <i>iku</i>, or the verb, to go.</p><p>The other characters in the sentence (<span class='ja'>は</span>, <span class='ja'>に</span>, <span class='ja'>きます</span>) are hiragana. This is getting ahead of ourselves, but they are used in the sentence as particles and a conjugation. Using <span class='ja'>は</span>(wa) after my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生は</span> denotes that I'm the subject of the sentence. Using <span class='ja'>に</span>(ni) with shop <span class='ja'>店に</span> denotes the direction of the action. And, <span class='ja'>行きます</span>(ikimasu) is the present positive conjugation of the verb <span class='ja'>行く</span>, meaning to go.</p><p>Putting the meaning together: Jim goes to the store. (or Mr. Jim goes to the store.)</p><div class='title'><b>Hiragana and Pronunciation</b></div><p>Even though there are three writing systems, both katakana and kanji can be written in hiragana, which is the first alphabet we'll learn. Additionally, every hiragana character can be written in Alphabetic characters, which is where we'll start when learning words. This is called Romaji.</p><p>Let's go back to our sentence.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span><br/><span class='ja'>じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span><br/>jimu-sensei wa mise ni ikimasu</p></p><p>Looking at the sentence in Romaji can help with pronunciation. Each hiragana has a specific sound and pronunciation doesn't change based on spelling as in English. Here's all the Hiragana, with Romaji to the right.</p><p><div class="columns center"><div class="column"><span class='ja'>あ　い　う　え　お</span><br/><span class='ja'>か　き　く　け　こ</span><br/><span class='ja'>さ　し　す　せ　そ</span><br/><span class='ja'>た　ち　つ　て　と</span><br/><span class='ja'>な　に　ぬ　ね　の</span><br/><span class='ja'>は　ひ　ふ　へ　ほ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ま　み　む　め　も</span><br/><span class='ja'>や　　　ゆ　　　よ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ら　り　る　れ　ろ</span><br/><span class='ja'>わ　　　　　　を</span><br/><span class='ja'>ん</span></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">a <span class='ja'>　</span>i <span class='ja'>　</span>u <span class='ja'>　</span>e <span class='ja'>　</span>o<br/>ka<span class='ja'>　</span>ki<span class='ja'>　</span>ku<span class='ja'>　</span>ke<span class='ja'>　</span>ko<br/>sa<span class='ja'>　</span>shi<span class='ja'>　</span>su<span class='ja'>　</span>se<span class='ja'>　</span>so<br/>ta<span class='ja'>　</span>chi<span class='ja'>　</span>tsu<span class='ja'>　</span>te<span class='ja'>　</span>to<br/>na<span class='ja'>　</span>ni<span class='ja'>　</span>nu<span class='ja'>　</span>ne<span class='ja'>　</span>no<br/>ha<span class='ja'>　</span>hi<span class='ja'>　</span>fu<span class='ja'>　</span>he<span class='ja'>　</span>ho<br/>ma mi mu me mo<br/>ya<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yu<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yo<br/>ra<span class='ja'>　</span>ri<span class='ja'>　</span>ru<span class='ja'>　</span>re<span class='ja'>　</span>ro<br/>wa <span class='ja'>　　</span> <span class='ja'>　　</span>wo<br/>-n</div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Speaking in terms of English pronunciation, the overall Japanese language is based on 5 vowel sounds with a combination of the above consonants. The vowel sounds do not change when paired with other characters.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that ji, from my name <span class='ja'>じむ</span>, is not listed in the alphabet. There are certain characters that can take a <i>ten-ten</i> mark or a <i>maru</i> mark to slightly expand the alphabet. <span class='ja'>し</span>(shi) becomes <span class='ja'>じ</span>(ji).</p><div class='title'><b>Kanji and Readability</b></div><p>Note: Often students wonder, if you can write a sentence using only hiragana, a much less complex writing system, why ever use the other two? Why not write everything in hiragana.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span> vs.<span class='ja'>　じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span></p></p><p>Coming from English, it makes sense to write everything using a limited number of characters, but the overall readability of the kanji sentence is far higher than the second. In fact, I added spaces in the hiragana sentence to improve its readability, but you still have to read each character to understand the words. The kanji sentence doesn't even need it.</p><p>While we don't use Kanji in English, the idea of using symbols to form a familiar shape representing a word is not so foreign. We've been reading and writing English since we were children, and one of the natural passive techniques we've developed is recognizing a word purely based on its shape. As long as the shape of the word fits the pattern we're used to, we can read and understand the word immediately without looking at each of the letters.</p><p>Kanji works the same way. Once you know the meaning of the kanji, you don't even have to read the whole sentence. Because there are so many kanji, much of a sentence's ambiguity is also removed. When I say, "light" without any context, do I mean something that shines on to a surface or something that's not heavy? Much like English, Japan has words written in Hiragana the same way with different meanings. But when using Kanji, the meaning is clear.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Again, learning Japanese is not a simple process. Just takes things step-by-step. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. And, always try.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Culture Shock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/culture-shock">Culture Shock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 19, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Culture shock is the overall swing of excitement and depression that comes with being in a foreign country for an extended period of time. Almost everyone has some form of culture shock, but it is different for each person and each person deals with it in different ways.</p><p>It can sometimes happen abruptly from a situation or incident, or slowly build from small problems over time. Sometimes, incidents of culture shock can happen immediately upon arrival. Other times, it might be months until feeling some kind of culture shock. For me, there have been two periods where I've lived in Japan, now and study abroad in college. Both circumstances for living in Japan were entirely different, so the conditions of experiencing culture shock were entirely different, too.</p><p>Either way, when living in a foreign country, culture shock follows 4 (or 5) overall stages and the overall graph of your steady mood usually looks like this.</p><p><canvas id="fullChart" /></p><p>Going up, then down, back up and eventually returning to equilibrium. The four main stages are <span class="rainbow_mag"><b>The Honeymoon Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_voi"><b>The Frustration Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_blu"><b>The Adjustment Phase</b></span>, and <span class="rainbow_gre"><b>The Adaption Phase</b></span>. The fifth extra phase is <b>The Reintegration Phase</b>, when returning to your own country.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Honeymoon Phase -</b></div><p>When people think of culture shock, they often think of it as something negative. But, the overall feeling of experiencing life in a new country is often met with excitement. There are so many new things to experience differently from your own country. New food, new buildings, new money, new people, new stores. If you're a fan of your new country, touching things that you've dreamed of for the first time is an amazing experience you'll probably never forget.</p><p>All of these new experiences raise your overall mood level, and we move up the curve.</p><p>If you're only in a foreign country for a short amount of time, especially on vacation or a very short study abroad, this is probably the only part of the curve that you'll experience. This was the case when I studied abroad. Every day felt like a vacation. Exploring Nagasaki and writing blog posts about it was an amazing adventure that had something new and interesting each day. I never experienced any cultural problems large enough to pull me down.</p><p>So, in short, the honeymoon phase is meeting differences in culture with joy and excitement.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Frustration Phase -</b></div><p>The shock phase is the opposite. This is what happens when meeting differences between your countries and cultures has problems. This is also what people think of when they hear, Culture Shock.</p><p>Again, this can happen gradually over the course of several incidents or perhaps even one big incident. Problems are caused by not really understanding what people are saying. Or by people not really understanding you. Problems are caused by something someone said or did that was different than what you expected. Problems are caused by someone putting you into a situation where you felt uncomfortable and you felt trapped. And problems are also caused by small differences in culture that annoy and bother you that built over time.</p><p>It's easy to feel alone when you're in a foreign country. People often describe this feeling as being put into a box. In a foreign country, you don't have the same comforts as your normal routine. If you have a problem, you may not have a way to comfort yourself. And often when seeking those comforts, you can't find an equivalent and often don't know how to ask for it. So, for any problems, you hide in your box and you wait for this feeling to pass. Or, you wait until you're back home.</p><p>Often as you recluse, anything foreign or anything outside of your normal will reinforce these feelings and put you further into a spiral you cannot break from.</p><div class='title'><b>Experience</b></div><p>Often when you're in a foreign country for a short amount of time, you probably won't have enough time for these problems to really build and hit you. And if you do have problems, you only have to wait until the end of trip. There's a fast-approaching light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>That doesn't mean it won't happen for short trips, but be prepared that it might. It really comes down to expectations. Making too many assumptions without verification often leads to problems.</p><p>Frustration and Shock is much more common to occur after several months of living in the country. After meeting with people and working with people, making friends, and hanging out, you begin to feel like you're accepted, and like you've become part of the society.</p><p>But, you are pushed away. Your friends or co-workers do something that clearly shows they do not truly accept you as part of their society. You're just the foreigner, and you'll always be the foreigner. Once again, you made an assumption that you thought was fact.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adjustment Phase -</b></div><p>The overall strategy of Culture Shock is not to avoid it, but learning how to deal with it. This is the adjustment phase. Much like frustration, the ways that people naturally adjust are different for each person, but there's always room to learn and try new ways of returning back to natural mood level.</p><p>Skipping to the punchline, the overall best way of adjusting and understanding the situation better is to talk about it. Talk with your co-workers and friends about why you felt uncomfortable. Talk to other foreigners about similar situations, how they felt and how they overcame it. By talking about it, I mean opening a dialogue and expressing ideas. By talking about it, I <b>do not</b> mean to confront them about what they said and try to teach them why it's bad. </p><p>On one hand, they could absolutely be out of line and did something worthy of being called on. But, on the other hand, within their culture, it could be a socially-accepted action. If you call them on it, you're only reinforcing your foreign divide between them, and possibly reinforcing their behavior. Often in these scenarios, it's up to you to change. It's up to you to ask others and inform yourself about why any misunderstandings may have happened.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Tricks</b></div><p>Above is the overall best way to adjust, but there are several tricks to help elevate your mood.</p><p>If you're being overwhelmed by too many things outside of your comfort zone, try to reconnect with things from your home country. It's a good way to feel like you're normal. Buy some foreign food from your country. Or watch a movie. Or visit somewhere that reminds you of home. Call your parents or call your friends back home. If you feel like an outsider, take a vacation and be an outsider, if only for a few hours or a day.</p><p>It's also pretty simple, but exercise. Exercise is a great way to mentally relax. Often as you blow off all of your physical strength through exercise, your mental strength will get exhausted, too. Then, you're able to move through your emotions and process them. Maybe meditation is your thing instead of exercise? Singing is fun, too.</p><p>Whether its food or exercise or singing, finding some way of centering yourself can slow or stop your downward fall, so you can begin the climb back up.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adaption Phase -</b></div><p>The Adjustment Phase course corrects your mood and brings your back up to normal, through the Adaptation phase.</p><p>The more you understand about your foreign country, the more you can understand about how you fit into it. When you can successfully apply that knowledge to your life, you feel like you've had a win. You feel like you've overcome a barrier and become closer to your new home. <b>This is your overall goal</b>. Overall understanding and adaptation isn't something that happens over night. It takes time, patience, and communication. And often new problems occur. </p><div class='title'><b>Reoccurrence</b></div><p>Culture Shock and frustration isn't a single event. It's often multiple events throughout your life in a foreign country that make you feel like a foreigner and not accepted. Once you feel you've adapted, it's not uncommon for something new and unknown to happen and bring you back down.</p><p>Also, it's not uncommon for people to cling to quick fixes or escape rather than truly reach out, communicate and understand the problem. If you hold on to grudges and problems, you will never fit in and you'll always be an outsider. </p><p>Ultimately, your goal is to fit in society as best as you can. You must adapt in some ways in order to do this. This doesn't mean losing part of yourself. It means gaining a new part of yourself. Gaining the ability to fit into both societies.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Reintegration Phase -</b></div><p>If you're in a foreign country to live forever, then adaptation is the goal. But most foreigners will eventually go back to their country, either for a trip or for good. Then, the whole cycle begins again, but often it can be more severe. This is The Reintegration Phase, also sometimes known as Reverse Culture Shock.</p><p>If you've adapted and integrated in your foreign country, now YOU are the foreigner when you return home. You are expected to pick up life exactly as you left it, but you are different. You've changed. You do things differently than before. You talk different than before. Your personality may have changed, too. Depending on the length of time you've been away, your country has changed, too.</p><p>If you've been integrated in your foreign country for a while, you can often forget what it's like to no longer have a foreign bubble around you. You suddenly instantly passively understand everyone and everything around you, whereas in your new country, you become comfortable in certain levels of understanding. </p><p>People make a lot of assumptions about you, too, because they don't see you as anything different than themselves. Adjusting is often a harsh reality of what you've left behind.</p><p>This is normal. But, you've been here before. Honeymoon phase, Frustration phase, Adjustment phase, and Adaptation phase. Do your best, and don't give up. Communicate, Exercise, and Adapt.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Virtual Tokyo Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/virtual-tokyo-marathon">Virtual Tokyo Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 18, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As the pandemic began, live events around the world were canceled and marathons were no exception. Luckily for them, the virus landed under their “acts of god” clause in their contracts, so they didn’t need to issue any refunds. But they had to adapt to the situation, just like everyone else and all other companies in order to stay in business.</p><p>In lieu of being able to do physical marathons, many organizations began to host Virtual marathons, and many of these virtual marathons were free or significantly cheaper than doing them in person. To run them, you needed to download a GPS tracking running app, like Strava, and record a run with the same length as the race within the correct time period.</p><p>These virtual marathons became so frequent and so cheap that throughout 2021 I was running one nearly every weekend. In 2018, I set a new personal record in distance having run a total of 367km in official races over the entire year. I spent nearly $1000 doing this, too. In 2021, I ran 365.6km in all of my races combined, only spending $200. This was an absolute godsend, even though my race times weren’t nearly as good.</p><p>The Tokyo Marathon was a race that had been on my bucket list ever since I started running in Japan. Every year I applied, but every year, I was unable to win the entry lottery for general entry. Much like all other marathons, it had been canceled in 2020 and pushed to 2021. Then canceled again and pushed to 2022. </p><p>Finally, this year, the Tokyo Marathon was finally held again, but only for the elite and career marathon runners. There was no general entry. To make up for this, they added an online component. Anyone who had general entry in the race could participate online for free. Additionally, the general entry became open to everyone for 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. This was finally my chance! Not only that, I only had to run a half marathon rather than a full.</p><p>On March 5th, in the yet still snowy country-side, I ran my half marathon and completed the race. The app was very cumbersome, and I wasn’t really sure if my time actually registered. But today! I got my medal in the mail.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Perhaps it is not a legitimate Tokyo Marathon medal, but it is good enough for me!

| April 2, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the main goals of Pokemon is to catch every species of Pokemon available. I've talked about this before in my post about the <a href="/old/v7/completing-the-national-pokedex" title="/completing-the-national-pokedex">National Pokedex</a>. But, it's possible to take this a step further. These days, for every Pokemon, there is a 1 in 4096 chance that it will be <b>Shiny</b>. A Shiny pokemon is a rare variant that appears in a different color. </p><p>Recent Pokemon Games have had methods of increasing the odds of getting a Shiny Pokemon. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've been streaming video games on Twitch. And, in particular, I've been streaming hunts of Shiny Pokemon through these methods. When streaming on Twitch, I have HTML overlays in OBS that shows my progress of catching all Shiny Pokemon in the game, so I can keep track of what I have left to catch.</p><p>I've been streaming Shiny Hunts in <b>Let's Go Eevee</b>, and recently with the release of the excellent <b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b>. Additionally, <b>Pokemon Go</b> makes it VERY easy to catch Shiny Pokemon. Not only is there is an increased base Shiny catch rate of 1 in 512, but often there are events that increase the odds as much as 1 in 20. So, I made a similar list to track my Shiny progress there, too.</p><p>You can view copies of these lists from the following links:</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><b>Pokemon Let's Go Eevee</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo">Shiny Completion List</a></div><div class="column"><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/dex" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/dex">Shiny Completion List</a><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/order" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/order">Shiny Catches</a><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/missing" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/missing">Remaining Shiny Pokemon</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><b>Pokemon Go</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/go" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/go">Shiny Completion List</a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>With all these lists keeping track of Shiny Pokemon, I was curious about my Shiny Progress across all Pokemon games. I have caught a few Shiny Pokemon in the main games, too, through events and randomly (though, rarely) in the wild. Combining all the counts from the above lists and the main games, I made an overall Shiny list.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><b>All Games Combined</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex">Overall Shiny Completion List</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast">&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These lists are mostly up to date, but because I am manually entering data, it's really easy for them to get out of date. The index page for all of these lists has the date of when they were last updated.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon">Shiny Pokemon Index Page</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast">&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Also, all of these lists are part of the schlock-bot project in git-hub.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's Go Eevee</b></div><p>I became interested in Shiny Hunting thanks to Let's Go. While watching various YouTube videos during the pandemic, one video showed that you could find a Shiny in about 20 minutes by catching the same Pokemon over and over again. I tried it out, and it worked! I caught my first Shiny Magikarp.</p><p>In Let's Go, you can increase your chances of getting a Shiny by doing three things. One, when you complete the Pokedex, you'll get a Shiny Charm. This will give you 2 extra chances for a Shiny. Two, when you use a Lure in the game, it'll give you 1 extra chance. And Three, the biggest one, when you catch the same Pokemon, you build a Catch Combo. When that combo reaches 31 and above, you'll get 11 extra chances for a Shiny. With all three combined, this gives 15 chances out of 4096, the equivalent to 1 in about 274.</p><p>It was incredibly satisfying to start up a stream, and usually have a shiny appear once every hour. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>While streaming, I would record my shiny catches using <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">schlock-bot</a>, and use that <a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo">above overlay</a> to display my progress.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b></div><p>I am in absolute love with Pokemon Legends Arceus. Since its release two months ago, I've been streaming the game, and shiny hunting has been pretty easy.</p><p>Much like Let's Go, there are several methods of increasing chances for Shiny pokemon to appear. One, the Shiny Charm will give 3 extra chances this time. Two, the overall goal of the game is to complete the Pokedex. You do this by more than just catching Pokemon, though. If you complete an entry, you'll get 1 extra roll. But, if you perfect the entry, you'll get another 2 extra rolls. With all of these combined, you'll 7 chances out of 4096, the equivalent of 1 in about 586.  Just in the wild!</p><p>Additionally, there are Mass Outbreaks and Massive Mass Outbreaks of Pokemon. Including all of the above, Pokemon in mass outbreaks have a Shiny chance of 1 in about 128! In Massive Mass Outbreaks, chances are 1 in about 216. These chances are even better than Let's Go!</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Pokemon Legends is my favorite Pokemon game of all time, it is incredibly satisfying to fly around and collect Shiny Pokemon. Much like Let's Go, I recorded my shiny catches using <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">schlock-bot</a>, which updated the above display lists.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Go and Others</b></div><p>People have been Shiny Hunting on Twitch and YouTube forever, but I don't think it became mainstream and accessible until Pokemon Go. As mentioned above, the overall base Shiny rate is increased to 1 in 512. I think this was their incentive to keep people playing because if you play for 3-4 hours straight in a day, you have a pretty high chance of finding a Shiny pokemon. </p><p>Furthermore, Pokemon Go often has events that make Shiny hunting easier. One way is increasing the spawns of particular rare Pokemon, which gives you more to catch and more chance for a Shiny to appear. Another way is increasing the base odds of a Shiny appearing. The most common of these events is the Community Day, which boosts the odds up to 1 in 20! You are virtually guaranteed to catch several during the event!</p><p>Because of Pokemon Go, I think Game Freak has made Shiny hunting more accessible in the main games, too. Also with Pokemon spawning in the overworld (instead of random battles), you can easily see whether a Pokemon is Shiny. You can check WAY MORE pokemon these days than you could before.</p><p>In my free time, I still stream on Twitch, and usually I'm playing Pokemon. So, feel free to stop by and say hi!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Capsule Machine Capsule" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/capsule-machine-capsule">Capsule Machine Capsule</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A miniature capsule machine for my shelf.</p><p>Now that I had one, I needed to have them all! I searched for the set on the Internet and learned what I could. This particular set was called <span class='ja'>ガチャガチャマシーン</span>３ (or Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3), and it was released in December 2021. So, it was already out in the wild for 3 months. I learned that you can buy full distributions of some capsule times on Amazon.  For Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3 that consisted of 24 capsules, which was 3 complete sets of 8 items: 3 red machines, 3 white machines, 1 pack of capsules, and 1 set of metal shelves.  So, the Capsules I had gotten were a 1/8 rare pull. The red machine was a typical 3/8 pull.</p><p>I continued searching on Yahoo Auctions to find someone selling the missing items in my set, but most people were selling a full set of 8 or selling the rare pulls for a lot of money. Eh. I gave up. One capsule machine is good enough. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Update - March 2023</b></div><p>This has continued to nag at me over the last year. The other day, I was back on Yahoo Auctions looking around and I saw an auction for the two unique pieces of the set I was missing: the white capsule machine and a set of the shelving. It was only $10, so why not?</p><p>Not long after they arrived in the mail. The White capsule machine was in perfect condition, looking amazing and working well. The shelving was not.

I had already streamed some Playstation games using the native share method, but I wanted to stream Switch games, too.</p><p>I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer external capture card (after the Elgato one didn't work) and it worked pretty proficiently. OBS uses a lot of power when running, so I have to limit my streams to 720p or else the battery can't charge itself fast enough from all the power usage.</p><p>I streamed Let's Go Eevee almost daily for multiple hours. Unfortunately, Nintendo did not release end of the year stats as they did for previous years. :(</p><p>In July, I was finally able to order a Playstation 5. I had tried getting one in Japan, but there were so few shipments and retailers had many weird hoops to go through to get one. I got mine directly through Sony online in America, so I had my mom ship it to me, which was a little expensive. :( </p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p>With a Playstation 5, I started playing some more games on stream rather than just Pokemon. Although, every game I played was an enhanced version of a Playstation 4 game (or simply a Playstation 4 game). <b>Final Fantasy VII Remake</b> got a PS5 version. <b>Death Stranding</b> got a PS5 version.</p><p>The first game I played through on stream was <b>Control</b>, a some cerebral action-adventure set in a retro corporate setting. You play as Jesse, who is appointed as the new director of the FBC, and you tear through the depths of the vast headquarters looking for your brother and the secrets of the organization. It was neat, and free with PSN from a few months prior.</p><p>My absolute favorite game of the year was <b>Outer Wilds</b>. It's a very simple game where you play as an alien species on a small world. The sun will go super nova at the end of the day, and you explore all the planets and other locations of your solar system to discover the ancient history of your species, as well as find a way for life to survive the super nova. It's an incredible experience where you are given the tiniest spec of a hint at the beginning of what to do, and from there, everything is found through your own exploration and experimentation.</p><p>Anyways, here are my stats:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Even though Nintendo did not release play stats for the Switch, with the termination of the Wii U and 3DS online services, Nintendo did make a webpage where you could see your lifetime stats from both platforms.</p><p>Compared to the 900 hours I played on my Nintendo Switch last year, 1102 lifetime hours on the 3DS seems a bit low.

Each form is a letter of the alphabet, plus a question mark and exclamation point. Unown is special because it was originally only available at physical events. And at those events, only specific letters were available. Over time, it's become easier to catch at least one form of Unown, but certain letters have only been available a few times.</p><p>So, which letters are the most common? Which ones are rare? And where have they been released?</p><p>I've been keeping track on this page: <b><a href="/apps/pokemon/unown" title="/apps/pokemon/unown">/apps/pokemon/unown</a></b></p><p>This page shows the data in 4 ways:<br/>1. It shows which ones I'm missing and which events they were available at.<br/>2. It shows an ascending list of the rarest Unowns and their events from the last 3 years.<br/>3. It shows an ordered list of how many times each Letter has been available, and which events.<br/>4. And, it shows each individual event where Unown had been available, and which ones were there.</p><p>I use this page to determine whether or not I should throw away some Unown after I catch them. If I go to an event in Japan, and a particular form appears that has not appeared back in the US, I'll hold on to more than usual so I can trade with people.</p><p>The Exclamation Point, for example, was available at Go Fest in 2019, but has not been available since.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dune" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dune">Dune</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 2, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dune is like a dream. The film is told with subtle movements, occasionally abstract visuals, and ambient overwhelming music that guides you forward through the story. There are a few action sequences, but they serve more as a bullet point to the overall story being told.</p><p>It is directed by Denis Villenueve, who also directed Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, two of my absolute favorite films of the last few years. The motion picture score is done by Hans Zimmer, who wrote the music of Blade Runner 2049 and many Christopher Nolan films. While his Nolan scores are very similar, the music of Dune sets itself apart to build a dreamlike state.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Story of Dune</b></div><p>The story of Dune begins its focus on Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides and heir to their House. House Atreides has become strong in both political and military power within the houses of the known universe, so the Emperor decides to install them as fief of Arrakis, Dune, deposing House Harkonen. House Harkonen have a long hatred of the Atreides, and the Emperor uses this opportunity to push the Harkonens to wipeout House Atreides.</p><p>Paul is the son of Lady Jessica, a devout member of the Bene Gesserit, a secret order of women who train their bodies and minds to obtain superhuman abilities seen as magic to outsiders. Over centuries, they have carefully steered bloodlines of the powerful Houses of the universe to birth a human with the most powerful mental abilities ever seen. They believe this person would be able to control the known universe and bring everlasting peace. Lady Jessica gave birth to Paul in defiance of the order, giving him the seeds of this power. </p><p>Arrakis is the most politically important planet in the universe. The surface is covered in desert, and within the sands is a substance called spice. Spice is a powerful hallucinogen that will unlock a person's mind to its full capabilities. Genetically engineered and breed humans of the Spacing Guild use its power to unlock intergalactic space travel allowing humans to travel across galaxies. It is the most important and priceless substance in the universe. Those who control Arrakis harvest the spice and sell it within the universe's market, giving them immense wealth.</p><p>Prior to Paul's arrival on Arrakis, he has dreams showing his possible futures. On Arrakis, these dreams lead him to understanding the culture of native Arrakins known as Fremen. Spice opens and unlocks his mind to more dreams powerful and predictive. As his House is attacked and destroyed by the Harkonens, he and his mother are forced in the desert where the spice surrounds him. They find the Fremen and are accepted into their city.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Meaning of Dune</b></div><p>Dune 2021 is only Part 1 of a long long story that lasts thousands of years. It's doubtful that this movie series will actually make it that far, though. I think Villeneuve has said he only plans on adapting Paul's story, and not continuing the story of his children which continue into millennia. There is such a huge time gap, and it's somewhat disconnected from the purpose of the story, anyway.</p><p>Overall, the meaning and purpose of Dune is to show the consequences of faith and charismatic leadership.</p><p>The Bene Gesserit have seeded prophecy across the universe. Over generations, simple rumors and tales of a promised warrior destined to save their people from evil has turned into religion and faith. These religions consume planets and create populations of devote followers. All under the guise of the Bene Gesserit projecting themselves as deities.</p><p>The Arrakins and Fremen see Paul arrive on Dune and they see this prophet. Paul's interest and obsession of Arrakis as well as his mental conditioning allows him to quickly adapt and understand their culture. Arrakins confuse this as prophecy. All they have ever known is oppression and with the emergence of hope, they cling to it and force themselves and Paul into it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" /></p><p>Spoilers, but this will be the center-piece of Dune Part 2. Continuing with further spoilers, ultimately, this holy crusade is inevitable and worlds worth of people and civilizations die as a result. That'll be Dune Part 3, which I hope to god they are able to make.</p><div class='title'><b>The Weight of Responsibility</b></div><p>Something Dune Part 1 does exceedingly well is show how Paul takes reluctant responsibility. There have been many stories of reluctant heroes, and they always whine about not wanting to do what they have to do. Paul states at the beginning that he does not want to lead.</p><p>With the death of his father, he is now Duke Atreides. He doesn't try to ignore his potential political power as head of his House. He thinks of ways of how to use it to turn the situation into his favor. He accepts his responsibility.</p><p>In the final act of the film, a Fremen warrior forces him into combat where the victor is determined by the death of the other. Paul easily outmatches him, but attempts to find a middle ground having never actually killed before. While other stories would have the hero give up or whine about it, Paul understands that he must kill. And so he does.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" /></p><p>This death weighs on him. Yes, it's his first kill, but it's also the first direct casualty on his path forward. A path that he is forced to take and he will not back down from. He confirms this by saying that his road leads into the desert, not off world. He takes responsibility for what he must do, but also feels the weight of it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Design of Dune</b></div><p>While the story subtly builds, the design and music become the most dynamic parts of the film. The technology and structures of Dune are never explained in the film, so we're presented with vehicles and tools that appear to work like magic, their shapes often abstract. Many shots in the film show their immense scale. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" /></p><p>The size of a single person cannot even be measured against these enormous objects. However, their reach and power extends far beyond their size.</p><p>Every person in Dune is descent from humans. Over millennia of genetic engineering, conditioning, and life on distant separate planets have turned many human sub-specie into something alien. Their design make them feel alien, too, unlike other science fiction works.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h01m46s188_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h01m46s188_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h01m46s188_t.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h04m06s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h04m06s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h04m06s574_t.webp" /></p><p>Visually, I think Dune is stunning.

Prior to the film's release, Hans Zimmer released <b>The Dune Sketchbook</b>, which featured music from the movie but presented them in a meandering build, like he was trying to find the sound from his ideas, like an artist uses a sketchbook. As such, some tracks are very even and don't really work together as a complete album.</p><p>A few weeks later, <b>Dune The Motion Picture Soundtrack</b> was released. This album had 22 tracks of score that was directly included in the film. No extras or changes like the Sketchbook. However, tracks that were extended in the Sketchbook were not included in the Soundtrack. </p><p>After the movie was released, I combined both albums together to create a more complete musical journey analogous to the build of the film. Some sketchbook tracks didn't work as they were too uneven, so I put Moon Over Caladan first, and removed Song of the Sisters. If you did include Sone of the Sisters, it would go after The One, but I think it breaks up the movement from the Gom Jabbar to Leaving Caladan. It also has redundant sounds from Bene Gesserit.</p><p>Here is my arranged tracklisting combining both albums.</p><p class='img'><table class="tracklisting"><tr><td class="number">1.</td><td class="title">Moon Over Caladan</td><td class="notes">The Dune Sketchbook — Track 6</td></tr><tr><td class="number">2.</td><td class="title"> Dream of Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">3.</td><td class="title"> Herald of the Change </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">4.</td><td class="title">I See You in My Dreams</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">5.</td><td class="title"> Bene Gesserit </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">6.</td><td class="title"> Gom Jabbar </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">7.</td><td class="title"> The One </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">—</td><td> Song of the Sisters </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">8.</td><td class="title">Paul's Dream</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">9.</td><td class="title"> Leaving Caladan </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 6 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">10.</td><td class="title"> House Atreides </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">11.</td><td class="title"> Arrakeen </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">12.</td><td class="title"> Ripples in the Sand </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">13.</td><td class="title"> The Shortening of the Way </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">14.</td><td class="title"> Visions of Chani </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 9 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">15.</td><td class="title"> Night on Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 10 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">16.</td><td class="title"> Armada </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 11 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">17.</td><td class="title"> Burning Palms </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 12 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">18.</td><td class="title"> Stranded </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 13 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">19.</td><td class="title"> Blood for Blood </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 14 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">20.</td><td class="title"> The Fall </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 15 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">21.</td><td class="title"> Holy War </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 16 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">22.</td><td class="title"> Sanctuary </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 17 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">23.</td><td class="title"> Premonition </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 18 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">24.</td><td class="title"> Ornithopter </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 19 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">25.</td><td class="title"> Sandstorm </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 20 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">26.</td><td class="title"> Shai-hulud </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">27.</td><td class="title"> Stillsuits </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 21 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">28.</td><td class="title"> Mind Killer </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">29.</td><td class="title"> My Road Leads into the Desert </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 22 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">30.</td><td class="title"> Grains of Sand </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 9 </td></tr></table>A third album was released to accompany an art book, <b>The Art and Soul of Dune</b>. All of these tracks are ambient versions of music already included in the previous two albums. It's meant as a background accompaniment as you read and view the content of the book. Overall, because they're too ambient and usually redundant, they don't really fit into my arrangement.<b>The Lore of Dune</b>Dune has always been a story and world that many people have considered impossible to adapt (yet this is the third adaptation). After watching the 1984 film and 2000 television mini-series, it seems like it's pretty easy to adapt. Although, both productions are severely flawed. Also, I've never read the book, so I don't know what I'm talking about.Apparently the books are incredibly dense with lore that would completely slow down and obscure any movie or TV show. Watching videos on YouTubes and reading about Dune online, completes the picture for me as Dune 2021 skips over A LOT of stuff.Prior to watching to watching Dune 2021 in theaters, I didn't know anything about the story or lore of Dune. What I had seen before, I had completely forgotten. But, I was still able to understand character motivations and what everyone was doing. The story in Dune 2021 is presented well enough that you don't need encyclopedic knowledge of the source material. On the reverse side, if you have this encyclopedic knowledge, I think it only enhances what is going on.You don't need to know that humans have completely rejected computers and robots, and that people have been engineered, trained, and conditioned into biological thinking computers, called <I>mentats</I>. That's what this guy is, by the way.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" />The movie doesn't tell you that Paul has also been trained as a mentat, which gives him the ability to learn about Arrakis and the Fremen incredibly quickly.Everything you need to know about the overall lore of Dune is hinted at or mentioned briefly. Despite not giving you enough information, the movie respects the viewer enough to make those connections in the future, or review the source material to confirm your connections.<b>The Future of Dune</b>The end of Dune Part 1 is the most jarring part of the film. There's no real ending to the film at all. It just stops. I suppose this was alluded to at the beginning when the full title of the film "Dune Part 1" was revealed. It makes sense as this is a single part of an overall story, but it's still jarring. Dune Part 2 will continue directly where Part 1 ends. And I expect Dune Part 3 will be the conclusion of Paul Atreides story. Denis Villeneuve has professed in interviews that he is a lifelong fan of Dune, and it has always been his dream to create a series of motion pictures that perfectly capture and encapsulate the story of Paul Atreides. I imagine that we will get a complete trilogy of Paul's story. But, the further story of his children may or may not be told.I imagine that Villeneuve will probably move on to something else after three Dune films, but the greedy studio will push ahead with Children of Dune. I suppose that is our problem in the future to deal with.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" />I eagerly anticipate what will come in the future.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Edge of Tomorrow" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/edge-of-tomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Ultimately, its low marketing budget and audience's saturation of mindless sci-fi action led to its poor box office returns, labeling it a bomb. But, this film is very underrated and under-appreciated, and it's a shame.</p><p>The overall story focuses on a single decisive battle between humanity against an invaded alien horde conquering most of Europe. Loss of this battle will result in the loss of the planet and life on Earth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tom Cruise is the star of the film, which both helps and hurts the film. One year prior, Tom Cruise starred in Oblivion, which wasn't that great. I think the reception of that film hurt this one quite a bit because people didn't want to see another stinker. At the time, I think Tom Cruise was seen as very humorless and self-serious because of viral clips online. But, his ideas created a lot of the humor and light-hearted situations in this film.</p><div class='title'><b>William Cage</b></div><p>Tom Cruise portrays William Cage, the head of an advertising firm forced to join humanity's army because of his ROTC training in college. He is a coward and does marketing in the guise of journalism for the army to sway humanity's trust into their war efforts. To avoid battle, at the beginning of the film, he tries to blackmail the leading general of the frontline to avoid going to combat. He's arrested and thrown into the army with the new recruits.</p><p>While training with the new recruits, he doesn't know how to operate his weapons, he tries to run away from battle, and tries to convince others to get him out. In the battle, he squadmates are killed by alien enemies, known as Mimics, while he avoids getting hurt. As a final act, before the enemy kills him, he grabs a claymore mine and sacrifices himself as he blows away the enemy towering over him. Dead.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage awakes the previous morning, alive. The sergeant alive. His squad alive. He relives the same day again as it happened before. Once again, he's thrown into battle.

Her victory was the first time humanity had hope at actually defeating the enemy, so she became an symbol for the war effort.</p><p>Cage first meets Rita in battle on his first day, but she is immediately killed by incoming fire. So, on Cage's second day, he tries to save her, but he is killed.

The goal of this class is for students to become more familiar with listening to and speaking native English with correct feelings and expressions. The majority of the class focuses on listening. Students will get a script with various words missing from the dialogue. While listening and watching the scene, they'll fill in the blanks with what's missing. We'll also go through the meaning so students can keep up with the story.</p><p>These listening activities lead to Performance Tests. Rather than doing a final Listening Test for the unit, students will make pairs and perform a scene from the film. Students will not only memorize and say the correct dialogue, but must act the scene with correct expression and feelings with their voice, face, eyes, and body.</p><p>The first performance test is when Cage meets Rita on the battlefield after days of trying to save her. From his actions, she realizes and understands Cage's situation. She throws down her weapon, and exclaims, "Find me when you wake up." Cage confused by the response replies, "What?" Rita, one more time clearly orders, "Come find me when you wake up," and they're both killed by an explosion.</p><p>Because the dialogue is so short, students exchange roles. My grading mainly focuses on the student performing as Rita. Cage's response is important to support Rita's dialogue, but ultimately it's Rita's dialogue that is key to this scene. Students must make a distinction between how the dialogue is said first compared to the second time when it is so clear, without any misunderstanding.</p><p>Again, check the <a href="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow">course page</a> for the full performance criteria, as well as worksheets.</p><div class='title'><b>Defeating the Mimics</b></div><p>Following orders, Cage ditches his squad during training to find Rita during her training. He tells her about what's happening, and she understands. She tells him that she used to have the power to reset time, and she used to win the battle at Verdun. She lost the battle when she was wounded and a medic transfused her blood.</p><p>Both of them go to meet Dr. Carter, played by Noah Taylor, a scientist who had previous helped Rita during the Battle of Verdun and understands how the Mimics operate. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Mimics operate as a single entity. The normal orange enemies are the Drones. They operate as an unthinking appendage of the horde. Killing them has no real effect. The larger blue enemies are the Alphas. These act as the enemy's eyes, ears, and nerves. When killed, an alpha sends a signal to the brain, which is called the Omega. When the Omega receives this signal, it restarts the day and corrects its course to victory.</p><p>On the first day, Cage killed an Alpha, but Cage was covered in the Alpha's blood. By absorbing the Alpha's blood, he also absorbed the Omega's power of resetting the day. When Cage dies, the Omega resets the day, and everything starts again.</p><p>To win the war, the Omega must be killed. Cage and Rita train together to make Cage mentally strong enough to kill the Mimics. Each day, Carter searches for the location of the Omega. As Carter gets closer to finding the Omega, Cage and Rita work on a strategy for plowing through the battlefield and reaching the location of the Omega.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Second Performance</b></div><p>After days and days of dying and little progress each day, Cage and Rita make it to a farmhouse miles inland from the battle.

They convince Cage's squad to join them, and they fight through hordes of drones without the safety of being able to die and try again. The Omega seems to be throwing all of its troops against them, almost as if it knows that they are coming.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h52m37s485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Rita and Cage make it to the Omega after each of Cage's squad members are killed off.

With the enemy destroyed and inert, the war is over and the battle is no longer necessary. All of his squad members are alive having never entered battle. Rita, too. The film ends with Cage meeting Rita at the base.</p><div class='title'><b>Morals</b></div><p>There are several morals to be learned from the film that I like to imbue on students. The first moral or lesson is the importance of repetition and continuous efforts towards your goal. Winning the entire war seemed absolutely impossible at the beginning of the film, but it was through Cage's reluctant yet continuous efforts that he gained the confidence and knowledge needed to win.</p><p>Additionally, he was not successful on his first attempt or even his fiftieth attempt. Cage constantly experienced failure and learned from his failures every day to progress further and further to eventually achieve victory. These efforts ultimately rewarded him with the ability to know what to do in an unknown situation when he no longer had the ability to reset the day at the end.</p><p>Also, through all of his daily failures, he showed his bravery. In the beginning, he was a coward who would do anything to run away from battle and danger. But, even on his first day, he showed bravery by killing himself to destroy the Alpha. That small showing of bravery gave him this power, and each day he showed more bravery trying to save his squad mates, and save Rita, too.</p><p>One of the key quotes in the film is <b>"Battle is the Great Redeemer."</b> Battle shows a person who they truly are as they shed whatever person they were in society. Cage was ultimately victorious because, at heart, he was courageous and brave. When pushed to the ultimate limit, what kind of person are you, really?</p><p>All morals are important for life, and the film shows this through Cage's journey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Original Script Ending</b></div><p>The finished film we received has a pretty happy ending overall, and doesn't necessarily play by its rules at the end. The whole film Cage always goes back to the base. But now, just to wrap everything up in a nice bow, he goes back to before he dishonored himself with the general, escaping punishment. His overall sacrifice ended up rewarding him with a happy ending.</p><p>The original script was not so kind. Leading to the final battle, it seemed like the Omega knew they were coming. One of Cage's squad mates even yells this out, "They know we're coming, man!" This is because, in the original script, in this battle previously, they had killed an Alpha. Killing an Alpha resets the day, but anyone outside of the Omega living that day wouldn't know it. </p><p>The Omega knows they are coming, and kills them all off one by one. The Mimics take over the Earth, and humanity is lost.</p><p>Tom Cruise and the production crew did not like this ending for several reasons. Thematically, it didn't really fit with the direction of the story towards the end. It didn't make sense for Cage to learn everything and grow, just to be killed in the end. Also, it wouldn't balance the overall feelings of the film. There are some comedic moments, but everything is so tense. There needs to be some relief. And, we've seen everyone die over and over again throughout the film that seeing more death wouldn't really have the weight to it.</p><p>I think they made the right choice.</p><div class='title'><b>Novel Differences and Ending</b></div><p>Edge of Tomorrow is adapted from a Japanese "light" novel entitled, <b>All You Need Is Kill</b>, by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It has since been adapted to a manga, too. There are some key differences in the story that lead to a different ending than both movie versions. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The biggest overall difference in the story which leads to many other story differences is that there's a fourth Mimic type. In addition to Drones, Alphas, and the Omega, there are also <b>Antennas</b>. For every Alpha, there is an Antenna, and the Antennas receive the signals sent from the Alpha to trigger the Omega to restart the day. For Rita and Cage to destroy the Omega, they must first destroy all of the Antennas, and then the Omega.</p><p>In the end, Cage and Rita (actually his name isn't Cage in this, but it doesn't matter) eventually destroy every Antenna and land the final blow on the Omega. But, the day resets. Even killing all the Antenna didn't work. This was because an Antenna still existed.</p><p>Much like Edge of Tomorrow, Rita had previously gained the time power from fighting in Verdun. But, when she lost the power, she didn't lose it completely. She became an Antenna and Cage is her Alpha. All Antenna must be killed. So, after killing all other Antenna, Cage and Rita face each other, and Cage delivers the final blow. He then destroys the Omega, ending the war.</p><p>Out of the three endings, I like this one the best. Rita can finally make her sacrifice that she decided on earlier. She's able to join everyone who died with her at Verdun, and the rest of the world is able to survive the Mimic invasion.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>Even with these three endings, people online have come up with lots of other ideas for endings. Also, recently (2024), there have been talks with Tom Cruise and Warner Bros to make a possibly sequel. With such a happy ending, there is still room to have more time shenanigans. So, how will they continue the story? What could they do?</p><p>Concluding class, I ask students to come up with a premise for the sequel.</p><p>One of the more creative endings from fans was Cage still retaining the time power from the Omega. After living his life with Rita, Cage finally dies of old age. But then, he wakes up back at the beginning of the final battle only to live his life again. The film could revolve around Cage becoming a bit of a demigod with the time power warping him. Ultimately, Cage has to figure out how to truly die.</p><p>Overall, <b>Edge of Tomorrow</b> is an incredible film. It's one of my strongest classes that revolve around a film. There's so much good in the film. This post is pretty long, and I never even talked about <b>Bill Paxton's</b> incredible performance as Master Sergeant Ferill. </p><p>I already spoiled the whole movie, but if you've made it this far without seeing it, you've gotta see it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the most beloved and revered spinoffs of Pokemon is Pokemon Snap for Nintendo 64. The idea of roaming around in a land while wild Pokemon "naturally" interact with each other and the environment has always given reality to people's imagination of how the real world of Pokemon could be.</p><p>For years, people have always said that they should make a modern update to Pokemon Snap and they finally did. Release on April 30th, <b>New</b> Pokemon Snap is the modern update every one had been asking for.</p><p>Back on the Nintendo 64, only 151 Pokemon were available, but 20 years later, there are now over 900 Pokemon. This game doesn't have all 900, but it has an incredibly balanced variety of Pokemon from all the different generations. It's pretty amazing how much New Pokemon Snap doesn't focus on just one generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>New Pokemon Snap plays almost identically to the original. You character hops into a pod and is pulled through the world on a mostly linear track. Your job is to take photos of Pokemon that appear in the environment. </p><p>Through the game, you unlock some ways to interact with the Pokemon. In New Pokemon Snap, you can throw out food for them to eat, throw orbs to light up pokemon, and play music. These interactions can change the course of your pod, or unlock other things.</p><p>Expanded from the original is the possibility of different tiered photographs. Depending on the interactions you before with Pokemon, they could perform a unique pose or even a special pose.  Every Pokemon now has 4 level of photographs to be taken. Tier 1 is a stand photo and Tier 2 is typically the Pokemon eating food. Tier 3 and Tier 4 are reserved for unique poses</p><p>With 200 total Pokemon in the game and each Pokemon having 2 unique poses, that's 400 unique photographs you need to take. It is a bit overwhelming, especially towards the end of the game when you're missing many of these photos. When you only get 1 or 2 new photos in a single run, it gets VERY repetitive and VERY boring quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>High Score</b></div><p>All photos in the game give you a score. If you get a "perfect" photo, it'll be worth 4000 or more points. All of these points add up to the total score of your Photodex. Pokemon Snap came out right at the beginning of Golden Week, so I had an entire week off from work to devote to this game. I was playing this game almost every day for HOURS after its release, so I was flying through the game.</p><p>Additionally, you can connect online and compare your Photodex score to everyone in the world. At my peak, I was able to become nearly 800th place in the world.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I could not keep up this pace forever. Vacation had finished, and I had to get back to work. Everyone else in the world who played video game for a living continue on without me.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnout</b></div><p>As mentioned above, once you do the broad strokes of everything in the game, all that is left is grinding. Finding all of the remaining photos, one by one. Slowly increasing the scores of your photos, one by one. Doing the same tracks, again and again and again. </p><p>There's not really much skill involved with the game. You wait 5 minutes to get the perfect photo, and if you miss it by a fraction of a second, you gotta do it again.  You try to get Pokemon to do what you want, but it occasionally goes wrong, and gets frustrating.</p><p>Eh, there's really no reason to push myself too hard in this game just to build my hatred for it. It's a good game and I like it, otherwise.</p><p>So, I put the game down. Here are my final stats in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it's a fun game with a lot of stuff to do. The Pokemon interactions are fun and interesting. Plenty of Easter eggs and hidden interactions to find that are really satisfying when you naturally find them.  Definitely worthy of the Pokemon Snap name. :)<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/11">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/9">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
