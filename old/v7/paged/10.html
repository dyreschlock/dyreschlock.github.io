She continues throughout the day as everything had happened before. By the end of the day, she changes her actions to avoid the situation that led to her death. But, she's murdered again in a different way by the same person.</p><p>Thus, the mystery and suspense continues in sometimes unexpected ways as Teresa stumbles into various death scenarios to ultimately find her killer.</p><div class='title'><b>High School Expression Class</b></div><p>Since 2019, I've been using this film in my 1st year Expression classes. This was actually the first film I decided to use, too. Despite being a horror film, it is PG-13. There's no blood or nudity, so it's a very school friendly film, besides the idea of suicide. Here are the full <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course contents</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jessica Rothe is also really great in the film. She puts in all of her efforts in each of her scenes to bring out feelings of tension and mystery. Her acting is very expressive which makes it easy for students to understand her thoughts and feelings without necessarily understanding what is said. Broussard does a pretty good job with this, too, and complements Rothe together as Tree and Carter.</p><p>Another reason that I really like the film is the overall journey Teresa takes from beginning to end. Throughout her adventure, she's able to examine her life and understand how terrible she's been to others. By the end, she's changed into a better person.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the class ends, I mention to students that people often go through life working on one thing to the next without truly examining their life. It's important to think about the kind of person you really want to be, and think about what you can do for yourself and others around you to accomplish your goals and their goals, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Class Contents</b></div><p>You can view the whole list of course contents on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. After watching portions of the film, I have questions for students to answer about the contents. Or, we'll watch a particular scene again and again for listening. For questions, we'll watch the film with English subtitles. For listening, there are no subtitles. Sections of listening are often followed by double-checking the meaning of the dialogue.</p><p>The main fun of the course are the performance tests. Two students will make a pair and perform dialogue together. The full grading criteria is on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. Grading for the performance test is based on the correctness of the spoken dialogue, the expressiveness, and also cooperation between both members because acting isn't something done alone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first performance scene is about 25 minutes in the film between Tree and Lori. Tree has already been killed twice, so she confesses to Lori about what's going on and how she feels. Lori doesn't believe her. In the scene, one student is Tree, and one student is Lori. While performing the dialogue, they should correctly show these emotions through their voice, body movements, and facial movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The second performance test is way more intense. After dying 5 or 6 times, Tree is sent to hospital. The killer is there, too, but Tree escapes in Gregory's car. She's then pulled over and arrested on an empty highway. She thought she had gotten away, but the killer catches up with her and confronts her in the back of the police car. Through frustration, fear, and confusion, she snaps at the killer. "What do you want? Why are you doing this? Who are you?"</p><p>This is the performance. One student stands over the other, and Teresa says these words with passion and emotion. Then, they switch roles. I think it's easy for students to understand her frustration and fear, but students should really try to push their voices to match the emotion. Not too loud, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final performance is the opposite. After realizing her terrible behavior and how she has treated her father, Teresa finally meets him at the restaurant and apologizes. She holds his hands, and whole heartedly says, "I'm sorry" and "I love you."</p><p>In a pair, one student is Teresa and the other is the father. They hold hands, and one student expresses these words to the other. This isn't so easy to do. Eye Contact is important. Also, students should try to think of their own parents to correctly express their feelings.

But Nintendo takes its time to fully realize their vision for each game, and rarely does that vision ever fail.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The original Legend of Zelda was too much for me as a kid, and Zelda was too hard. A Link to the Past was absolutely perfect. The environments, the music, the dungeons, and items and puzzles. You always felt like that progress you made was an accomplishment. Ocarina of Time fully realized that vision in 3D, though it has aged a lot. Twilight Princess modernized that vision.</p><p>Having fully realized their vision, they tried to innovate with divisive results. They released a direct sequel to A Link to the Past entitled A Link Between Worlds, which opened up the world. No longer did you have to follow a linear story path from dungeon to dungeon. With people used to the idea, Breath of the Wild fully realized their direction for the future while still holding true to the past. A complete open world where exploration unveils the story and many other secrets.</p><p>Below is my tier list of Zelda games. I'm very traditional when it comes to Zelda, so I don't think the results are much of a surprise.</p><p>GOAT Tier - A Link to the Past, Breath of the Wild<br/>S Tier - Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, A Link Between Worlds.<br/>A Tier - Wind Waker, Minish Cap<br/>B Tier - Skyward Sword<br/>— others</p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: The follow-up to Breath of the Wild entitled The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is an absolute masterpiece of exploration, story, and innovation through gameplay. It's hard to think of a game dethroning Wild, but it is better in every way. It stands alongside A Link to the Past as the Greatest Of All Time for me.</p><div class='title'><b>5.

You play as Gillian Seed who had lost his memory and joined the Junkers, a police division which specializes in hunting down the Snatchers. Ultimately, the plot is uncovered and Gillian Seed gets more answers to his past. </p><p>Snatcher was Hideo Kojima’s second game as a sole director. The Sega CD version was the one I played back in the day. It was released in 1994 and was the 4th iteration having prior been released on PC-8801 (1988), MSX (1988), and Turbo CD (1992). This was the only American release, and it was complete with English voice acting and cutscenes. </p><p>The music is very futuristic 90s synthwave that matches the grimey, dirty, and metallic feeling of Neo Kobe City. As the story builds, the music builds with it. It was one of the first games I played where the music set a tense mood and atmosphere rather than just being background music. Snatcher’s sound and music was written and arranged by Akira Yamaoka. This was one of his first games, too. Later on, he would curate and write music for DDR, and ultimately move on to create the Silent Hill series.</p><p>I will always love Snatcher, and I don’t think I’ll ever knock it off my No. 1 position as my favorite game of all time.</p><div class='title'><b>My Favorite Games</b></div><p>As you can see from my list, my favorite games tend to be the ones that allow exploration of a massive world, have a compelling story with unique and distinct characters, and have a unique and memorable soundtrack that accurately compliments the setting, the gameplay, or the story. I tend to value those aspects over the actual gameplay.</p><p>It’s interesting to see how my favorites list has changed over the last few decades. You can view my list from 2007 below. Over time, I can’t really see this list changing much more. I think the top entries are pretty much set.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock">Schlock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was 30 minutes long, and only showed movie trailers.  Mostly trailers for new movies, but some old ones, too.</p><p>One such episode featured a movie called Schlock<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY</a></p><p>It was one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, hilarious-not-hilarious, trying-too-hard things I'd ever seen at that point.  Over the next few years, I searched around pawn stores, video stores, and old rental stores trying to find a copy of it on VHS, but it seemed like no one even heard of it.<br/>The name was pretty unique, so I used it as my screen name for AOL and everything else since.</p><p>In October 2001, it was finally released on DVD, and on my birthday that year, I was finally able to see it.  I had a bunch of people over to my dorm room, both friends from MN and college.</p><p>It didn't necessarily live up to my expectations, but I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, there were some pretty great moments in the film.

I think 10 years ago, the DVDs were going for the same price they are now, $150.</p><p>But now, once again in my birthday month, Schlock has been released again, now on Bluray, and in a rather nice package.  The booklet had a story about how John Landis scrapped together what he had to make it.  There's a reversible cover.  The movie is a 4k restoration.  There's a few commentary tracks.

Now, 18 years later, my store has been closed for good. Obviously the rise of the Internet economy slowly chipped away at Toys R Us's market share, but the real death move began in 2005 when <b>Bain Capital</b> bought the company. </p><p>In 2005, Bain Capital and KKR bought Toys R Us for around $6.6 billion. In order to pay for this sale, that put up some cash, but they mostly shifted debt that they already owed into Toys R Us in order to cover the rest of the cost. In more detail, Toys R Us already had about $1 billion debt at the time of sale. Bain Capital and KKR payed $1.3 billion, and shifted $5.3 billion in debt into Toys R Us. As such, Toys R Us was now around $6.3 billion in debt and only valued at $6.6 billion. It was damn near bankrupt immediately. How is this legal?

Its market-share dropped. Its profits dropped. And Amazon, Target, Wal*Mart, and other retailers began to leave it behind.</p><p>By the way, Bain Capital did the exact same thing with KB Toys 10 years prior.

His field is the study of ethics and Japanese thought.</p><p>The lecture was given in Japanese and translated into English by Alex Bennett, who is currently a professor at Kansai University and has written and translated many books on the Japanese Budo arts.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my 3rd time attending the seminar.  Every year I’m able to get amazing insights into budo martial arts and learn about their connection to Japanese psychology and culture.  I previously wrote about the main lecture from the first seminar I attended two years ago: <a href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan" title="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan" title="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">March 4th, 2016</a>.</p><p>Overall, I felt the contents of the lecture did not match the title, but the main idea expressed in the lecture was another fascinating look at an explanation for Japanese culture.  The theme carried through the explanations and examples was that of <i>onozukara</i> and <i>mizukara</i></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」</span></span></b></div><p>Takeuchi<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>先生</span></span> explained the cooperative duality of these two forces behind the decisions and actions of people in Japanese culture and society.</p><p><i>Onozukara</i> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>おのずから</span></span> - <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>自然の働く</span></span><br/><i>Mizukara</i> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>みずから</span></span> - <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>自分の能力</span></span></p><p>Let’s do <i>mizukara</i>, first.  <i>Mizukara</i> is the effect from oneself.  It’s the idea that an action or decision you made came as a result of your own willpower.  <i>Onozukara</i> is the workings of nature, the idea that there is an overwhelming force behind a decision or action that made or allowed it happen.</p><p><i>Mizukara</i> is pretty easy to understand, but <i>Onozukara</i> is much more ambiguous.  In western countries, <i>onozukara</i> could be similar to the will of god.  God is an outside influence, and people often thank God for giving them fortunes, or blame God for misfortunes.  This was brought up in a question after the lecture had finished.</p><p>But for Japanese people, the idea of God is not a singular entity.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>先生</span></span> mentioned if you asked a Japanese person who they pray to when they pray, they would not have an answer.  They wouldn’t know.  The will of nature is a result of many different factors and moving parts within the world and society.</p><p>As another example, another question was asked, "Did you decide to do this lecture? Or was it the will of nature?"  He replied that he did want to do lecture, but he was also asked by many people to do it.  The people he knew and the connections he’s made throughout his life knew his expertise that made him qualified to give a lecture on this subject.  In that way, there was a force that created the opportunity for him to accept.  So, this lecture was a result of the actions of both nature and self.</p><p>So, the idea of <i>onozukara</i> is the force of everything around us.  It’s the connections we’ve made with people in our lives, the opportunities society gives us, and nature itself.  It is not, directly, "the will of God."</p><div class='title'><b>Example within Japanese Language</b></div><p>These two concepts aren’t something that is thought of on the surface level.  People aren’t consciously thinking about the will of themselves or nature when making decisions.  But there are examples within the Japanese language that build on this idea.</p><p>The main example given was <b>I am to be married</b> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>結婚することになった</span></span>.  When people get married in Japan and they announce it to their family and friends, they use this phrase.  It’s very passive and reflects the idea of <i>onozukara</i>.  Getting married is simply a matter of course.  It’s natural.  Additionally, the effect of getting married wasn’t just decided or caused between the two involved.  It was the culmination of the people around them and their families’ blessings and good intentions.</p><p>He did mention later in the lecture that a lot of young people these days use a more affirmative phrase when speaking informally about marriage, <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>結婚することにした</span></span>, <b>we’ve decided to get married</b>.  The two getting married take responsibility for their marriage as opposed to passively excepting it as a matter of nature.</p><p>There could be any number of reasons for why this is becoming more popular.  Perhaps young people aren’t being taught more tradition methods of speaking than they were before.  Maybe people aren’t getting married as often as before, so they don’t hear the phrase enough.  Or perhaps, as English and the western world becomes more prevalent in Japan, people are becoming more direct and affirmative when expressing themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Connections to Budo</b></div><p>As a practitioner of a budo martial arts, we also seek for our movements to become natural.  In the beginning, we chose to study a martial art of our own free will (<i>mizukara</i>).  We all have our reasons for wanting to do it, whether it be for health, for friends, for fun, or because it looks cool.  We start from ourselves.</p><p>There Japanese word <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>習う</span></span> <i>narau</i> means "to learn", but literally, it means "to continually repeat things" and becoming accustomed to it.  As a result, over time, these actions become natural.  You no longer need to think to do them.</p><p>In Budo, we strive for this level of movement where the thought process is no longer a factor, and to become part of nature, the natural flow of life (<i>onozukara</i>).  When movements and actions are not performed naturally, they are not seen as being complete.</p><p>In Kyudo (archery), for example, when one reaches the level of complete mastery, the practitioner feels that the bow no longer exists.</p><div class='title'><b>The 3 points of Japanese Thought</b></div><p>Within the balance of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> is the concept of Japanese thought and 3 points that define it.</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>自然</span></span> <i>shizen</i> - nature<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>意気</span></span> <i>iki</i> - will power<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>諦念</span></span> <i>teinen</i> - resignation</p><p>The idea of <b>nature</b> leads to accidental fury that was must put up with.  It’s something that we must endure and grow from.  <b>Will power</b> is the willingness to put your body on line for what may happen.  And if something goes wrong, it’s your responsibility to <b>resign</b> yourself to the outcome, and not make excuses for the result.</p><p>Though, resignation does not mean to simply give up.  It’s about reconciling the efforts of one’s will with the movement of nature, and to be able to see something clearly for what it is.  And in some cases, recognize your powerlessness to deal with whatever comes.  We take for granted our power over nature and often think that we can overcome it, but in reality we cannot.  Nature is a much greater force.</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>申し訳ない</span></span> <i>moushi wakenai</i><br/>This phrase literally translates to "there were no reasons behind my actions" or "there is no verbal excuse for what I have done."  This is used as a strong apology in Japanese, but an actual apology means to explain your actions and why you were wrong.  This goes one step further by saying there can be no excuse for the action I’ve done.  In this way, you’ve accepted the outcome (resigned) and take full responsibility (will power).</p><p>On the other hand…</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>すみません</span></span> <i>sumimasen</i><br/>This is used as a light apology and basically means <b>excuse me</b> or <b>sorry</b>, but the direct and complete translation is something closer to "my actions were not clear or clean or complete," or "I wasn’t able to completely do this action myself."</p><div class='title'><b>Other Japanese Words</b></div><p>Much like the lecture on the cardinal virtues of Japan, speaker Seiichi Takeuchi wrote several books on the subject of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.  He wrote 4 books, actually.  3 of which are out-of-print and expensive!  On Amazon, they are being sold for nearly 7000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.  But, there was one book I could buy for only 500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」のあわいで</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>やまと言葉で</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>哲学する</span></span>.</b> or <i>onozukara to mizukara no awai de yamato-kotoba de tetsugaku-suru</i>.  <i>Awai</i> isn’t so easy to translate, but I was told, in this context, that it basically means between.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>先生</span></span> talked about this balance between both <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> in his lecture, so I think it makes sense.  <i>Yamato-kotoba</i> basically means words (<i>kotoba</i>) that encompass the spirit of Japan (<i>yamato</i>).  And lastly, <i>tetsugaku</i> is philosophy.  So, the title is basically <b>The Philosophy of Japanese Words and Their Existence Between the Balance of <i>Onozukara</i> and <i>Mizukara</i></b>.</p><p>The book starts off with a quick summary and definition for <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>, and then has chapter on specific Japanese words, phrases, or expressions, their history, and their connection to <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For example, <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ありがたい</span></span> (thanks), <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>めでたい</span></span> (congratulations), <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>あう</span></span> (when meeting someone), <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>あいする</span></span> (loving someone), and so forth.

It should be expressed as "I decided to …"  Even if something is decided by the will of the individual (<i>mizukara</i>), it is expressed as something that has been predetermined for him or her as a matter of course (<i>onozukara</i>).  This in turn indicates a tendency to accept things in one’s life and the world as being naturally preordained and to be accepted passively.  The Japanese philosophers Kuki Shuuzou identified three elements in the features of Japanese thought: "nature" (<i>shizen</i>), "chic" (<i>iki</i>), and "resignation" (<i>teinen</i>).  This means that based on "natural" (<i>onozukara</i>) conduct, when something occurs the individual decides from one’s self (<i>mizukara</i>) to confront the situation putting their own body on the line (for example, seppuku) in the spirit of "chicness" (<i>iki</i>), while also resigning (<i>teinen</i>) the self to go with the natural flow (<i>onozukara</i>).  The culture of Japanese thought is considered within the encounter between the movement of nature (<i>onozukara</i>) and exertion of the self (<i>mizukara</i>).</p><p>Japanese budo culture is the same.  According to Kuki, "The ideas of Japanese morality maintain a significant meaning in universal nature (of <i>onozukara</i>)…  Morality which must reach the stage of becoming 'natural' cannot be seen as complete."  The term "morality" (<i>doutoku</i>) can be replaced by the word "budo" here.  In bud, first engaging in rigorous training or study from your own volition (<i>mizukara</i>), if it does not ultimately become an inevitably natural (<i>onozukara</i>) activity then it "cannot be seen as complete."  To "<i>narau</i>" (learn) means "to continually repeat things" thereby gradually becoming accustomed (<i>nare</i>) to it, and "reaching the stage where it is natural."  In the culture of Japanese bud, there are correlations with moral, religious, and artistic thought in that one’s own efforts (<i>mizukara</i>) will finally proliferate into and connect with natural expansiveness and depth (<i>onozukara</i>).  Seen in this way, the features and potential become apparent.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Funayama 船山 in Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/funayama-in-winter">Funayama 船山 in Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 11, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Blade Runner 2049 was a very overwhelming film when I saw it the first time.  A lot of that came from the sound, music, and visuals.</p><p>The sound and music are very loud and unnerving.  It helps describe the enormity of the future and density of the city.  Much of the music drips of wet industry.  Loud sprawling flanges in wide shots.  Silence and subtle tones in movement.  The technology of the future feels organic and grown out of past that incorporated the technology into itself, rather than began anew.</p><p>The art design compliments the music well.  The future iterates on the future shown 30 years ago in the original Blade Runner.  Displays are blocky monitors rather than flashy holograms.  Communication is done through these displays, rather than a smartphone-like device that keeps constant communication between people.  The future also feels organic and lived-in.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner</b></div><p>The premise of Blade Runner is that a corporation has developed technology to essentially manufacture people.  Replicants are not mechanical robots or cyborgs or something like that.  They are a completely organic manufactured person.  Designed to be less emotional and strong, they are mainly used off-world as a physical workforce or soldiers or whatever dirty-work humans don’t want to do.</p><p>In the first film, replicants are Nexus-6 models made by the Tyrell Corporation and are illegal to bring to earth.  Blade Runners are a section of the police force to capture or take out rogue replicants that somehow get to earth.  The main plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard, a blade runner, as he tracks down 4 rogue Nexus-6 models that have come to Los Angeles.  One significant aspect of the Nexus-6 model is their 4 year lifespan, which was used as a security deterrent if they were ever lost or escaped.  </p><p>The secondary plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard’s relationship with Rachael, who is a prototype Nexus-7 model.  She was given memories and believes herself to be human.  The memories define her as a person, and as such cannot be easily detected as a replicant.  They’ve removed the lifespan limit as well.  The film also famously toys with the idea of whether or not Deckard himself is a Nexus-7 model, too.</p><p>As a result of the events of Blade Runner, the Nexus-6 models were deemed too unstable or uncontrollable for continued use, and Nexus-7 models never went to manufacturing and their designs lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner 2049</b></div><p>Nexus-8 models were quickly developed by the Tyrell Corporation and sent to market.  Models had registration numbers imprinted on their eyes, and records of all models were kept in a central database.  Replicants were easy to tell apart from humans.  But the public rejected them because of how violent and problematic the Nexus-6 models were.  Many models were hunted down and killed in the streets on Earth.  This led to the events described in the short film, Blackout 2022.  Two replicants successfully destroy the database and detonate an EMP above Los Angeles to erase all records of Nexus-8 models.</p><p>From that point on, replicants became strictly illegal.  All surviving Nexus-6 models died naturally.  Nexus-8 models went into hiding.  The Tyrell Corporation went out of business.</p><p>Over the next decade, the infrastructure of Earth begins to deteriorate with the loss of the replicant workforce.  There are not enough people to sustain the ecosystem.  Niander Wallace of the Wallace Corporation buys the Tyrell Corporation and begins developing the Nexus-9 model of replicants.  These models are have the same feature of the Nexus-8 models, but designed to be absolutely loyal.</p><p>In the short film, Nexus Dawn 2036, Niander Wallace brings his new Nexus-9 model before congress, states his claim that humanity needs replicants and that the replicant-ban be revoked, and then demonstrates their obedience.  Congress moves to revoke the ban, allowing Wallace to mass-produce Nexus-9 replicants and help rebuild the Earth’s environment.</p><p>In Blade Runner 2049, the main character is a Nexus-9 replicant, KD6-3.7, or "K" for short, played by Ryan Gosling.  He works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner tracking down remaining Nexus-8 models.</p><div class='title'><b>Cells Interlinked</b></div><p>To verify K’s operational stability, he is subject to a baseline recalibration test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" /></p><p>The test asks him a series of questions followed by a word of phrase he is meant to repeat.  The replicant is not meant to think or respond to the question, only the subsequent phrase.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the film is how K’s obedience gradually and subtly erodes over time.  Much like the test, within his police work, he is meant to avoid or deflect questions while getting answers.  Within his investigation and daily life, every question is a test.  In the beginning, he doesn’t waver.  Sapper asks him questions.  He ignored them.  Luv asks him questions.  He deflects.</p><p>Besides answering to his boss, played by Robin Wright, it’s only when Mackenzie Davis asks him a question, "What’s this?"  "A tree," that he responds directly to someone else’s question.  The first failure of the baseline test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" /></p><p>Later, he speaks with Robin Wright about the case and she asks him a direct question of the case, "What do these numbers mean?" or "Do these numbers mean anything to you?"  He replies, "No."  A lie.</p><p>As K continues to investigate the whereabouts of a replicant born into this world, rather than manufactured, and as he starts to believe that he is that child, he starts to question his obedience and loyalty.  In following scenes, his stern emotionless face begins to crack under the weight of his feelings.  Through his blank face, we can feel his sadness, frustration, and confusion.</p><p>Blade Runner 2049 follows K’s transformation from a mindless "robot" into someone fighting for himself and others and what he believes is the right course of action.</p><div class='title'><b>Imagery</b></div><p>Because the movie centers on K and his lack of emotion, so many scenes feel sterile and emotionally distant even though they are gorgeous.</p><p>I went through the film and picked out many images that shows the beauty of Blade Runner 2049’s art direction in set design, costume design, and visuals.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Denis Villeneuve</b></div><p>So, Blade Runner 2049 was definitely my favorite film of 2017.

Both movies were continuations and adaptations of previous works, but had a voice of their own, presented with a tense atmospheric soundtrack and beautiful visuals that engaged me completely.  I haven’t really seen any of his other films, but I’m definitely going to pay attention to whatever he does next.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to January Total Lunar Eclipse" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/january-total-lunar-eclipse">January Total Lunar Eclipse</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

During the day, the moon moved in front of the sun and cast parts of America in darkness for a short time.  Total lunar eclipses are not so rare and seem to happen fairly regularly.  The website <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/">https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/</a> has a list of all their occurrences past and present.</p><p>Living in Japan, I’ve already seen one total lunar eclipse in <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon" title="/october-moon">October 2014</a>.  It was a beautiful and clear night, so the red, blood moon cast in the Earth’s shadow was in clear clear view.</p><p>This January, there was another total eclipse, which began around 8:30pm.  The weather was cloudy, but it was light with many breaks.  The moon was clearly visible in the sky.  </p><p>It was also cold cold cold.  It was definitely below zero.  Maybe -4?  I thought about driving to somewhere beautiful and open to view the eclipse, but it was just too cold for me to sit outside.  The moon was clearly visible from my apartment, so I simply set up my tripod in my kitchen, opened the window, and shot the moon from there.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the lack of indoor heating in Japan, the cold temperature indoors really made no difference.  My apartment usually feels like it’s colder inside than outside anyway.  It only lacks the wind.  Besides, sitting under a pile of blankets (as I usually do at home) would be warmer than sitting around outside.</p><p>Here was the schedule for the eclipse:</p><p>Penumbral begins - 7:50pm<br/>Partial begins - 8:50pm<br/>Full begins - 9:50pm<br/>Maximum - 10:30pm<br/>Full ends - 11:10pm<br/>Partial ends - 12:10pm<br/>Penumbral ends - 1:10pm</p><p>The penumbral is a partial shading or dimming of the moon as the Earth begins to eclipse the sun.  The partial is when the full shadow begins to engulf the moon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the moon well into the penumbral and minutes before the partial began to creep.  I don’t really see much difference.  I guess maybe the moon dimmed a little bit more than normal, but it’s still in full view.</p><p>But as the partial began, the moon definitely started to show a noticeable difference.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The shadow started to form in the lower left and, steadily over the next hour, it would move the completely cover the moon.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the moon continued to rise higher in the sky, it was met with more and more clouds.

| December 5, 2017 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Horizon Zero Dawn was a game for the Playstation 4 released in March of 2017.  It’s an absolutely beautiful game set in the far future after current society had already collapsed.  Roaming the lands are robotic animals that human civilizations hunt and harvest for parts to build and protect their villages.</p><p>From the moment it was first shown at E3 in 2015, everyone wanted to know more about it.  The concept looked interesting and unique.  Unfortunately, it’s release in early 2017 was completely blown away by The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.  On the surface, both games were an open world that lent itself towards exploration.  But Zelda had many aspects that innovated and expanded the genre compared to Horizon’s iterative approach.</p><p>But, unlike Zelda’s pure sense of exploration, Horizon’s strong sense of story fueled my exploration of the game’s world.  How did the world turn out like this?  Why are their robotic animals running around?  What is going on?  Underneath the lush beauty of nature are several metallic facilities of a futuristic society long dead.  Why?  And by the end, there are satisfactory answers to these questions.</p><p>Combat feels great.  Every beast you encounter has a weakness to exploit, or some specialized parts to harvest.  After a while, you are given enough equipment to take on these enemies in a variety of ways.  You can set traps, or blow off body parts.  Fire down arrows from safety, stealthily melee enemies from bushes, or just run in and attack directly.  It’s fun, and certainly challenging on higher difficulties.</p><p>Throughout my play through of the game, I stopped several times to use the photo mode and take a picture of the environment around me.  So many shots and scenes in this game is incredibly gorgeous, and the photo mode made everything come out great.  Every game should have a photo mode at this point.  Below are all the shots that I kept.  They include areas and scenes from the DLC, as well.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Final Fantasy XV" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It’s representation of women was poor.  And some sequences in the game required some patching and reworking from the developers.  But, I loved the music, setting, and, most of all, the main cast of characters.</p><p>From the beginning of the game, all the way through until the end, you play as Noctis and have your three friends, Gladiolus, Prompto, and Ignis, by your side at all times.  At the beginning, as a player, I didn’t really care for them.  In previous Final Fantasy games, the other cast members are just kinda there.  They have their one or two story moments, and for the rest of the game, they don’t talk or add anything to the experience.</p><p>In Final Fantasy XV, your three friends, the other party members, constantly talk about pretty much everything that’s going on.  Noctis doesn’t really say a whole lot unless it’s a pivotal story point.  I think most people get annoyed about this.  But after a while, it’s just the norm.  And their character shows through all of the interactions they have.  The friendship between the four characters isn’t really explained.  It’s felt.  It’s atmospheric.</p><p>For the first half of the game, none of this really has an impact.  You basically take your party members, your friends, for granted.  Then, at a certain point in the game, things change that impact your friendship.  They become quiet and sometimes scornful.  I was able to feel the magnitude of the decisions and consequences of the previous events through the change in atmosphere.  I had come to care for these characters, and now that things had changed.  It felt tense and sad.</p><p>And it wasn’t just getting passed what had happened or about trying to get things back to the way they were.  It was about living with the decisions that were made, and moving forward.  And moving forward together as a group, rather than breaking apart forever.</p><p>Being able to feel this connection to the characters and being able to relate to this kind of conflict through my own life was really powerful.  The localizers did an excellent job conveying this dynamic between the characters.</p><div class='title'><b>Photos</b></div><p>Anyways, one of the other great things about the game is the photographer of the group, Prompto.  Throughout play, he passively takes photos at somewhat random points.  When you take a rest at the end of the day, you can go through these photos and keep the ones you like.  Sometimes these photos even capture some glitches or bugs.</p><p>The following are all the ones I’ve kept.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/paged/11">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/paged/9">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
