| March 28, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b><u>Sword of Berserk</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>Sword of Berserk was actually my first exposure to Berserk. i remember hearing about how violent the game was, so i picked it up one day at work to check it out. (at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to La Pucelle Tactics impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/la-pucelle-tactics-impressions">La Pucelle Tactics impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 20, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As previously mentioned in others threads, there were a couple days over the christmas break where my brother and I went to just about every used video game store in Minneapolis. From that adventure, one of the titles I purchased was La Pucelle Tactics used for $25 at a gamestop, as it was the other Nippon Ichi ps2 SRPG that I had yet to play. Though, with all the work dumped on me this week, I'm not to sure how much I'll be able to play, nor if I really should. oh well, thats always how it is isn't it? ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>My own Nippon Ichi comparison</b></div><p>Nippon Ichi is really quite interesting. It is really neat how they were able to make these 3 games (La Pucelle, Disgaea, Phantom Brave) play so differently, yet still be challenging and work well.</p><p>Disgaea was extremely basic when compared to La Pucelle or Phantom Brave. It makes a good introduction to these 3 Nippon games, as it doesn't deviate too far from the most common SRPG, Final Fantasy Tactics. The gameplay is quite the same, yet it has more options that change difficulty, and other aspects of the gameplay. It also features two things that I hate. (1) A tright story which occasionally goes off on needless tangents, complete with annoying characters with minimal development. And (2) absolutely no sense of exploration and movement throughout the world. Though, fans of Disgaea easily put these two aspects aside in favor of the rock solid gameplay.</p><p>If you haven't played any of these 3 games, I suggest you begin with Disgaea because it only goes up from there. However, going from Disgaea, either Phantom Brave or La Pucelle would be fine as they both deviate from the 'tradition' SRPG gameplay style featured in Disgaea, and (at the highest level) both Phantom Brave and La Pucelle seem to be equally great.</p><p>Phantom Brave had some very interesting deviations from the 'tradition' SRPG stance. The most notable is the subtraction of the grid based movement system. Characters can move everywhere within the map, and even off the map too. Equipment was also radically changed as your weapons were now treated as characters themselves that you leveled and built. It's a system that I'd say most people didn't like about Phantom Brave as the character's stats actually became meaningless, and your most powerful person was whomever held your most powerful weapon at that time. It's something that you can try and ignore, but when taking on 2000 level bosses, you have to do it. There are also plenty of other things going on with <a href="/old/v7/phantom-brave-impressions" title="/phantom-brave-impressions">Phantom Brave</a> as well.</p><p>Though, the one thing that really got me into Phantom Brave was that my two problems with Disgaea were not an issue. Instead of a simple list of places to go, you now had a map to move about the world. And the story featured in Phantom Brave covered a wider range of emotions with the main characters who actually developed throughout the course of the game. The story kept to the point and didn't wander off for no good reason.</p><p><div class='title'><b>gametime: ~4hrs.</b></div></p><p>La Pucelle also deviates from the tradition SRPG styles by promoting a group fighting style. Movement through the map is still grid based, and you move your characters one at a time. However, when you attack or get attacked by enemies, there's a side-by-side screen that comes up showing your character(s) pulling off attacks. every character brought into this screen melee attacks the opposing side. Characters and enemies not even selected to attack can be brought into this screen and attack for you without telling them to. So, if you bring just one of your characters out in the open against 4 or 5 other enemies, you're going to get your ass kicked. You need to clump your characters together so that you can bring 3 or 4 chracters into battle, instead of just fighting alone.</p><p>The gameplay style reminds me of a cross between SNES Ogre Battle and Disgaea. In this battle screen, you have no control over your characters, but instead of just one assembled army fighting another, how you've arranged your characters on the field determine the battle participants. Long range characters are quite helpful with this. So in every battle, everybody attacks, and when you actually choose to attack an enemy, in effect, they counterattack too. You could choose to fight an enemy, and then die in that battle before even getting a chance to fight too. It makes for a very different game than Disgaea or Phantom Brave.</p><p>Special attacks are carried out differently. You select which characters or enemies you want to heal or attack, and then the attack is carried out immediately without any confrontation.</p><p>Battles also feature two other main differences: dark portals and purification. Every map has numerous dark portals randomly scattered across the field. Every once in a while, new enemies will spawn from these portals. Dark portals also have energy flowing from them in a straight line in one of the four directions. If an enemy or character is positioned on a tile the energy is flowing to, it'll get redirected depending on which way the chracter or enemy is facing.</p><p>You destroy these portals by purifying them, which any human character can do. Each character has a certain level of purification so sometimes it can take more than one turn to purify a portal. When purified, the stream of energy erupts in an attack, much like in Disgaea. All enemies in the stream are hurt. However, if you can move about the map and position characters and enemies to create a circle of energy, and then purify the portal, the circle will summon a creature and harm all enemies within the confines of the purified circle. Very powerful, yet hard to do.</p><p>Purification has another use as well. If you purify enemies, it increases the likelihood of them joining your side when they are defeated. This usually takes a lot of turns. It will change from nothing to "somewhat interested" to "thinking about converting" to "wants to convert" to "will convert no matter what." Kind of like the interest level for the dark council in Disgaea. This is how you build your army.</p><div class='title'><b>The World & The Story</b></div><p>Once again, La Pucelle doesn't have the same problem I had with Disgaea. You have a map where you move throughout the world. When you go into part of a dungeon you've already cleared, it'll show you the map and the paths you can take from that map. Dungeons can have multiple paths you can take, rather than just one way as in Disgaea and Phantom Brave. Alternate paths can reveal treasure or advance the story.</p><p>Occasionally in maps, you'll find a highlighted tile that doesn't represent a way in or out. Moving a character to this tile will lead to a cutscene that'll advance the story.</p><p>The story is split up into chapters like Disgaea and Phantom Brave, but each chapter has multiple endings, depending on what you did or didn't do during that chapter. For example, the first chapter you investigate the presence of zombies near the sewer. As you trek down the sewer, you find a castle. In one map, you can find one of those highlighted tiles, and unlock a room where two people were imprisoned and died. You learn about their past and more about the zombies and the castle. In another map, you find out more about the castle, and what is really going on, so when you eventually fight the boss, you aren't just blindly killing him. You know why you're doing it. You get monetary bonuses for Good Endings too. ^_^</p><p>As for the story, it also seems like it has more to it than Disgaea, although it follows the same formula. The characters are all part of a church, and the most powerful church of the land is cooking up something evil, and being part of this little yet faithful church. It's your job to investigate matters further. I've only completed 2 chapters so far, so I don't know all the details.</p><p>The main character of La Pucelle, Prier, is an obnoxious brat, but she still has logical qualities that doesn't make her as annoying as Laharl from Disgaea. They are brought out by the immediate supporting character, Culotte, her brother, as he usually talks about her. He describes her in a way that she would never describe herself. This provides two viewpoints of the story: the sensical side of the brother explaining the situation, and the brash comedical side of the sister doing things "her way."<br/>_____________________________</p><p>Anyways, La Pucelle is pretty good so far. I'll let you know how things turn out. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sasha @ Escape, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sasha-escape-minneapolis">Sasha @ Escape, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 12, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Intro / History</b></div><p>I remember as a child receiving Nintendo Power every month. I'd look forward to it. A decade ago, you'd have to resort to video game magazines to find out information about a game and whether or not it's worth your time. You'd rely on a paid opinion, and Nintendo Power was notorious for hyping the game with highest bid.</p><p>In February of 1991, Metal Storm graces the cover of Issue 22 with the cover art, a 12 page spread of maps and strategy going across the back-side of the poster, and also the poster itself had the Metal Storm Mech (though that could have been a different month). Quite a lot of press. Thanks to the Nintendo Power hype machine, I was exposed, but at the time I didn't think anything of it because I was more focused on Mega Man, Mario, and Sonic.</p><p>Flash forward to a couple years later when I read a review of the game saying it was the hardest nintendo game to date. "Oh really? Metal Storm?" I muttered to myself. Interesting. At least I think this review said it was the hardest. Maybe they meant hardest to find or something.</p><p>Flash forward again to last night when I finally played the game for the first time. This game is pretty damn awesome. It is quite tough, but it's that challenging kind of tough, not the impossible kind of touch. Zach and I ended up beating the game through on Normal in one sitting last night in the span of about maybe 2 hours. It's not that the game is so difficult, it's just a different point of view getting used to playing with gravity.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot00.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot00.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot00.webp" /></p><p><b>Metal Storm</b> / Nintendo Entertainment System / 1990-91 / Irem (the makers of R-type)</p><p>Metal Storm is a side-strolling 1 player game where you control a mecha through 7 action-filled levels. Each level has 2 parts and then a boss with the except of level 7 where you just fight all the previous bosses again. There's no real story except what the game tells you at the very end after defeating the final boss.</p><div class='title'><b><u>POSTIVES</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Game Design</b></div><p>Metal Storm has two very unique game design features that i haven't seen in any NES game, or any other video game past that.</p><p>1. You can shift the gravity of the stage, so you either run across the ground, or run across the ceiling. It may seem like a dumb idea, but this key feature makes the game challenging to try and defeat enemies while navigating the levels.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1a.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1a.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1a.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot1b.webp" /></p><p>2. Levels are vertically infinite. This goes hand in hand with switching the gravity around. Some stages are just straight, but some stages have you navigate through much larger mazes, where the screen move in all 4 directions, rather than just left and right, or up and down.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot01.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot02.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot02.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/metalstorm/shot02.webp" /></p><p>Throughout the six actually designed levels of Metal Storm, the design gets more and more intricate. Level 1 is your basic side scrolling level. You don't really need to switch gravity a whole lot, but it's there for you to mess around with and get familiar with it's exploits when in later stages, it is your greatest defense.</p><p>Level 2 gets right into the usage of gravity switching, as shown in those above screen shots. You have to navigate through an infinite maze, where you must switch gravity every now and then in order to correct jump through platforms. and so on....</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Most controls are basic. Run left and a right, jump, and shoot. It takes a little getting used to for switching the gravity. You can switch when you're on the ground or in the air, but you can't continuously switch in mid-air. you must touch the ground before you can change. To change gravity, if you're on the ground you hold up and hit the jump button, or if you're on the celing you hold down and hit the jump button. There's no one button to hit to switch so sometimes you'll be holding the wrong direction trying to change gravity. this is also a little weird when you're on the ceiling and you want to duck, you must hold up, instead of down.</p><p>It takes a little getting used to, but once you get used to it, it's not awkward anymore.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficultly</b></div><p>Gameplay aside, navigating through rightside up and upside down levels simutanously while defending yourself against other mechs, gunners and spaceshits is quite a task. Once you get hit by anything, you die. You don't have a life bar, or anything. You can get an item so you can get hit twice before you die, but thats it. Anything more, would make this game too easy, I'd say. The game gives you infinite continues already, what more do you want?</p><p>This game can get pretty intense, but as said before, it's the good kind of intense. most of the time when you die, it's some dumb mistake you shouldn't have made, not because 25 enemies rushed you (not like the nes could have 25 sprites on a screen at once anyways). All situations in the game can be taken care of with a little patient and practice.</p><div class='title'><b>Animations</b></div><p>For a Nintendo Game, the animation is quite above par. Most walk cycles, explosions, and movements have 5-10 frames each making the game look very fluid, very fast. Some Levels also have multiple layers moving in the background for an added shiny effect. Very high quality stuff packed into this game.</p><div class='title'><b><u>NEUTRAL</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Longevity</b></div><p>As earlier stated, Metal Storm took Zach and me about 2 hours to go through the first time. But there are multiple difficulties once you've completed the game. You get Expert mode, and then after that Second Quest mode. Expert mode features more enemies, and Second Quest features tougher enemies with the exact same stages. It's nothing all that new. If there were a speedrun for this game, it'd probably be about 20 or 25 minutes long, if that.</p><div class='title'><b><u>NEGATIVES</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Sounds</b></div><p>Yeah, the music is pretty boring and generic, and the sounds aren't all that great either. Fortunately the overall game experience isn't tarneshed.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>There is absolutely no inkling of story in this game whatsoever, until you've defeated the final boss and text rolls on the screen telling you what has happened. "but this is the nes age.. story has no place in a side-scroller."</p><div class='title'><b><u>OVERALL</u></b></div><p>Metal Storm features some very very interesting game design concepts that put a very interesting spin on a very overly used genre of the time, which made it both difficult and fun at the same time.</p><p>I'd definately reccommend this to anyone looking for a challenge from the past.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ Tabu, Minneapolis" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis">Gabriel &amp; Dresden @ Tabu, Minneapolis</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2004 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hey guess what? I've actually been reading lately.  Reading BOOKS.  And not those berserk manga, which are pretty dumb by the way.  I've been reading more of Chuck Palahniuk's books.  Today, I finally finished Invisible Monsters, which i started back last year but got too bored with to finish.  blah blah..</p><p>Anyways, I need stuff to do during lunch at work, so since last year i started reading. I started with Palahniuk's most recent novel, at the time, Choke, which was quite fun and very Fight Club esq.  Then, I ventured to Survivor, which i liked a bit better.  It felt more epic, more adventurous.</p><p>After reading those two, I attempted Invisible Monsters, but I got quite bored of it, so I quit.  The rest of last summer I spent sleeping in my car during the lunch period.  Then during Christmas I played Sword of Mana during lunch, and then for Spring Break, I started reading Palahniuk's Lullaby.  I had bought it a while ago because it was hard to find.  I got about halfway through and after getting back to Minneapolis from college, I finished it, and now I've finished Invisible Monsters, too..  blah blah blah blah..</p><p>Anywho, I don't think I gave Choke the credit it deserved.  One thing i love about Chuck's books is that the narrator is the main character.  So, since the whole book is set up like the main character is writing about what happened, it stands to reason that the climax of the story is a huge change in the character's life.  It's not just something that happens, but something that happens to the main character.</p><p>I was trying to figure out why I thought Survivor was better than Choke, when Choke basically has the same recipe as Fight Club, and Fight Club works beautifully.  There's no epic adventure in Fight Club.  But really, what's so epic about Survivor?  The only real adventure is them returning home.  Reading Lullaby and Invisible Monsters, the characters travel around in those books.  True in those two books, they don't have an exact meaningful destination, but it's set up and written the same.  Plus once branson reaches his destination in Survivor, he changes, but thats not <u>the</u> climax of the book.  It's a climax, but not the climax.  Survivor is pretty matted though.  The character's in Choke have their own style and are more bizarre than you'd think they'd be.  In Survivor, i guess you could say, the character's are a little more normal.</p><p>Choke is pretty schway though.  I'm really interested to see the movie adpatation.  I read they begin fliming it this fall.  I should probably read it again, and familiarize myself.  Once i finish reading Fight Club and Diary, i'll need something to do, anyways.</p><p>I love Lullaby, though.  I guess you could say it has an epic journey, but also has a couple character stories that move along the story quite well.  The whole theme of dark magic kept me interested and reading, unlike Invisible Monsters, where the theme was beauty and modeling and regular 'ol sex, which isn't that moving.  It was distracting me from the story ^_^.  Invisible Monsters ended quite well, but i couldn't pay attention to the climaxing story.  It was hard to keep track of the point in time as well because the flashback bounced around too much.  Also, characters in Invisible Monsters didn't really have any strong mental illnesses, there were more physical ailiments than mental.</p><p>Last year, I made a little chart filling in the ingredients to Chuck's recipe.  So, it's time to fill in the chart with the two books I've entered into my head.</p><table width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0"><tr align="center"><td style="width: 100px"></td><td style="width: 100px">Choke</td><td style="width: 100px">Survivor</td><td style="width: 100px">Fight Club .mov</td><td style="width: 100px">Lullaby</td><td style="width: 100px">Invisible Monsters</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px">Main Character</td><td style="width: 100px">Victor Mancinni</td><td style="width: 100px">Tender Branson</td><td style="width: 100px">-spoiler-</td><td style="width: 100px">Carl Streator</td><td style="width: 100px">various</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px">Illness</td><td style="width: 100px">sex-aholic</td><td style="width: 100px">born into cult</td><td style="width: 100px">insomnia</td><td style="width: 100px">--</td><td style="width: 100px">jaw shot off</td></tr><tr></tr></table><br/><b>to be continued</b><p><u>Lullaby Exerpt & Quotes</u></p><p><i>To justify any crime, you have to make the victim your enemy. ..

I say, maybe it was after years and years of getting the same prayers about unwanted pregnancies, about divorces, about family squabbles.
