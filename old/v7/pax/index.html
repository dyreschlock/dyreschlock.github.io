| August 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The annual Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle is this weekend.  This has been creeping up on me.  After moving into a new apartment, the last few weeks have been busy and just flew by, and I almost forgot about this.</p><p>At the beginning of August, they released the panel schedule, and over the last few weeks, game studios have been issuing press releases on all the games they plan on having in the exhibition hall.  Everything seems to be coming together, and I'm definitely excited.</p><p>Here's some of the panels (and events) that I plan on attending...</p><p><b>1up Presents: Retronauts v. Your Fondest Memories</b> - Friday 3pm @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Although I don't listen to retronauts anymore, their live podcasts are always great.  Jeremy Parish and Chris Kohler have an incredible wealth of gaming knowledge, and they're joined by Jeff Green this year, which should add some extra humor to the mix.</p><p><b>Minecraft Adventure Update Q&A and Demo</b> - Friday 3pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch hosts a Q&A for the upcoming Minecraft 1.8 patch, and plays through a demo.</p><p><b>After Party w/ The Protomen</b> - Friday 8pm @ El Corazon<br/>An intimate after party with one of the best video game music groups!  Openers include Jonny Nero Action Hero, and Klopfenpop.  Hosted by Fangamer.</p><p><b>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'</b> - Saturday 10:30am @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Though I'm not really fan of Destructoid people, Ashley and Anthony Burch, along with their father, form a hilarious sibling rivalry over specific games.</p><p><b>Irrational Games</b> - Saturday 2pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>It's been over one year that Irrational Games unveiled their upcoming title BioShock Infinite, the pseudo sequel/prequel to their 2007 hit game BioShock.  The panel is lead by Ken Levine as he discusses the development process, what we're seen already of BioShock Infinite, and they'll probably play through the E3 demo on stage.</p><p><b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> - Saturday 3:30pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>One of the biggest and most hyped games of this upcoming season is the new Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim.  Bethesda devs take the stage, and most likely will run through the QuakeCon demo on stage.  Super excited for this one.</p><p><b>Square Enix Presents...</b> - Saturday 7pm @ Pegasus Theatre<br/>Squaresoft is heading a panel as well, and they will be unveiling a brand new title.  This title is Airtight Games upcoming FPS from creative director Kim Swift (creator of Portal, and director of the Left 4 Dead games).  While I don't give a shit about Square anymore, I'm quite a fan of Kim Swift.  Can't wait to see what it is.</p><p><b>Minecraft Griefer Party</b> - Sunday 5:30pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch is tearing down the Minecraft booth and giving away pieces of it as souvenirs.</p><p>Nothing else really caught my eye.  It seemed like there were a lot more interesting panels at PAX East this year (<a href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced">reference</a>).  It's also annoying that there isn't a Chiptune showcase.</p><p>But that's fine.  My time at PAX is almost always spent in the exhibition rooms standing in lines waiting for games.  This year there is a huge amount of upcoming games I'm interested in and all of them plan to be at PAX.  These include <b>House of the Dead</b>, <b>Team ICO Collection</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls Skyrim</b>, and <b>Zelda Skyward Sword</b>.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml">this list</a>, there will also be indie game <b>Fez</b>, upcoming Suda 51 / James Gunn game <b>Lollipop Chainsaw</b>, <b>Batman Arkham City</b>, <b>Mass Effect 3</b>, Grasshopper published titles <b>Sine Mora</b> and <b>Black Knight Sword</b>, and Sony will have <b>Playstation Vita</b> units to demo too.  Mojaang (Minecraft) has a booth too!</p><p>It should be an amazing fun time.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Added stuff about Minecraft from their <a href="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/">schedule</a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX East Panels announced" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced">PAX East Panels announced</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 13, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>PAX East announced their schedule of panels today (or yesterday or whenever), and there are a lot of good ones.  It's too bad I won't be able to attend this year.  But there's plenty of stuff going on in the midwest to keep me busy.</p><p>If I were going to PAX East, these are the panels I would definitely want to attend:</p><p><b>1UP Presents: Retronauts Vs. 16 Bits</b> - Friday @ 3pm<br/>Live recording of 1up's defunct Retronauts podcast including panelists Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi.  Though, they will most likely record this panel and release it on 1up.com, so missing this panel won't hurt.  I ususally never go anyway.</p><p><b>From Background To Center Stage: Building Game Worlds As Main Characters</b> - Friday @ 5pm<br/>A panel including Irrational Games members Ken Levine and Shawn Elliot, headed by Julian Murdoch.  Plenty of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite matters included...</p><p><b>Inside Game Localization</b> - Friday @ 8pm<br/>Including the leads at Kajiya Productions as they discuss localizing Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics Ogre, among other things.</p><p><b>PAX East Chiptune Showcase</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>Zen Albatross hosts an event with some of the best chip artists from the east coast including Sabrepulse, Br1ght Pr1mate, and himself.</p><p><b>Owned but Independent</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>At the same time, a panel including Brian Raffel and Eric Biessman of local Madison game studio, Raven, discuss what it's like to be "owned" by Activision.  Even though, I would end up going to the Chiptune panel, it'd be nice to support local game development. ^_^</p><p><b>Videogame Antiques Roadshow</b> - Saturday @ 6:30pm<br/>A panel including Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi discuss game collecting and finding value in old games.</p><p><b>Making the "Citizen Kane" of Poker Games</b> - Sunday @ 3pm<br/>Idle Thumbs alert.  Sean Vanaman, Jake Rodkin and other Telltale Games members speak about the development of Poker Night at the Inventory.</p><p>These are all the ones that really popped out at me.  There's also the really high attendance panels such as the Penny Arcade panels, and everything in the main room, but I usually skip those.  I've attended enough of those in the past that I would know what to expect and there's plenty of other things that would keep me busy.</p><p>But yeah, I'm skipping PAX East this year. Â I plan on attending PAX Normal, as I do each year, so you can catch me there.</p><p>Here's the link to the full panel schedule: <a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php" title="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php">http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php</a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: SWAG and Purchases" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-swag-and-purchases">PAX 09: SWAG and Purchases</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All 60,000 passes were sold several weeks before the actual event, and the floor space of the Panel Rooms and the Exhibition Hall had extended further than before!

| September 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Since the announcement of Star Wars The Old Republic and their lofty plans for a story-driven nature in an MMO, I was definitely intrigued and ready to purchase to see just how they planned on accomplishing that.  Though, Star Wars fan were more excited about the idea of a new Star Wars MMORPG that would probably not suck.</p><p>Star Trek fans had the same excitement early last year when Cryptic Studios announced <b>Star Trek Online</b>.  Cryptic Studios have been responsible for City of Heroes/Villains, a super hero oriented MMORPG that they sold to NCSoft after acquiring the Marvel MMO rights.  Unfortunately Marvel fell through, and they changed the game to Champions Online to directly compete with their previous MMO.</p><p>Cryptic had many demo stations of the recently released Champions Online, but reserved a couple units for Star Trek Online which Five gave a try.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Star Trek Canon</b></div><p>Between Star Wars and Star Trek, I'm totally a fan of Star Trek.  I watched Star Trek The Next Generation every night before going to bed in High School.  I've seen all the movies, watched almost all of Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  So, while Five tried to figure out the annoying controls, I talked with a demonstrator about the canon of Star Trek in Star Trek Online.</p><p><b>Me</b>: What time period does Star Trek Online cover?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Star Trek Online takes place 30 years after the destruction of Romulus.  If you've seen the most recent Star Trek film, the Murauder and future Spock had journeyed back in time because of those events.  So, Star Trek Online takes place further in time than any Star Trek series or movie.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Can you play as any Star Trek race?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, you can play as any race that has ever appeared in any Star Trek series or movie.  In fact, you can make up your own race if you'd like.</p><p><b>Me</b>: That's weird...</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Weird?!  We at Cryptic think it's pretty cool.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Are there different factions or something?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, in Star Trek Online, you can choose between the Federation and Klingon.  In the Star Trek timeline, the destruction of Romulus cast doubt in the Klingon high council that the Federation had any idea of what they were doing.  Harsh words were spoken, and the Klingon broke off from the Federation.  Many of the events in Star Trek Online focus on that conflict and you can choose your sides.</p><p><b>Me</b>: So, if you're Federation, you just fight Klingons?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Absolutely not, Star Trek Online goes into all the conflicts with a wide range of Alien races throughout the Star Trek Universe.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Okey Dokey, sounds like fun ^_^</p><p><b>Me thinking</b>: eh, not really.</p><div class='title'><b>Combat</b></div><p>The demo focused completely on Combat.  That's all you really do in an MMO anyways.  Five commanded an Away on a planet's surface and started fighting some Klingons.  The Klingons were pretty weak though :/  This was pretty boring, so he beamed back to the ship and warped to another planet.</p><p>While orbiting another planet, Klingons appeared!  What strife!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp"  /></p><p>Space combat is pretty interesting and much more involved than clicking on dudes and beating them down with swords or phasers.  Those circular bars around your ship indicate the strength of your shields in those areas.  Depending on where you're taking fire, only those shields will be affected.  So, if you start taking a lot of damage in the rear, you should turn around and take damage from the side or front to even it out.</p><p>Much like every combat in a recent Star Trek, you can totally change the amount of energy put into the shields, or life support, or weapons on the fly!  "Full power to forward weapons!"  That's another thing, depending on the direction you're facing you can only fire aft torpedoes or forward phasers.  It's pretty damn sweet how they integrated very fundamental concepts from Space Battles in the movies or series into the game.</p><p>That being said, it's incredibly annoying to keep everything straight.  At least, it was in the first 5 minutes of the fight.  The races you choose also have an effect on evasive maneuvers and other things.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This game is pretty stupid.  I don't really see any point to it at all unless you're an absolute fan of Star Trek.  Creating your own race would be fun to fill in the gaps that Cryptic missed, but overall it's just a level grind.  The story sounds boring as crap with scrolling text relaying anything important.  I'm not going to pay attention to that.</p><p>The Space Combat was kinda neat though, but that's the only positive I got from the demo and it's really only a novelty to recreate battles from episode of Next Generation.</p><p>Star Trek Online releases for the PC sometime next year, if not 2011.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Split Second Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-split-second-hands-on">PAX 09: Split Second Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Returning home on Saturday, Ace asked a pretty important question regarding the nature of PAX.  <b>Were there any games you saw or played that you had no intention of buying until after you saw or played them?</b> Every company exhibiting games at PAX was there for the sole purpose of selling their game.  They weren't there for fun.</p><p>This has happened a couple times in the past.  In 2007, after seeing Mass Effect in action, I was sold.  Last year, Castle Crashers completely changed my mind and I bought it on the spot.</p><p>This year, that game would have to be Split Second.  Though, I wouldn't say it put me in a buying mood.

In your effort to finish first, you can knock out your opponents by causing explosions and considerably changing the environment of the racetrack.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp"  /></p><p>Throughout the race you build up that blue/red meter underneath your car.  It'll build up fast when you knock out opponents, catch some air, drift around corners, and any other fancy driving.  As the Blue meter fills up, icons will flicker in the surrounding environments when you can cause explosions to take out your opponents.</p><p>Once you fill two Blue meters, the third meter is Red.  Once the red meter is complete full, you can cause some serious explosions.  Like blowing up the flight control tower and crash it onto the race track.  Or blow up the road underneath your opponents exposing an underground promenade.  Or summon a 747 airliner crashing while trying to land on the runway.</p><p>The environmental effects of a Red explosion are huge and cause the landscape of the racetrack to change.  When you blow up the control tower, it blocks the track and racers need to go through hangers.  When you blow up road, you fall into a lower version of the track.  The changes create shortcuts, and more difficult areas.</p><p>Also, all the racers can blow up shit in the environment, not just you.  Things are blowing up all over the place once the computers think you're winning too much.</p><div class='title'><b>No HUD</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp"  /></p><p>One other very interesting thing about Split Second is the absence of a HUD (or Heads-up User Display).  There's no information on the corners of the screen.  As you can see from the screen shot, the place, laps, and explosion bar are tapered on the back of your car, which gives a very different driving experience than any other racer out there.</p><p>It's actually a pretty smart move since you need to pay attention to the environment around you, just as much as the cars in front of you.  The HUD would just get in the way.  And now you can see everything quite clearly.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Split Second is brought to you by Black Rock Studio, whose previous titles include Moto GP, Pure, and Hot Wheels Stunt Track.  Their past includes all racing games, but none of which have really made a name for them.  Split Second is definitely different, but could get repetitive very fast.</p><p>It was announced earlier this year, and should be release sometime in 2010.  Even though, it surprised me and I played it several times throughout the weekend, I don't plan on buying it.  It'll be at the top of my GameFly list, but I am skeptical the amount of enjoyment I'll get out of Split Second after playing it for 2 or 3 weeks.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-the-brodeo-live-reunion">PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One year ago in two weeks, my favorite podcast recorded it's final episode, and did not return to the Internet.  The Brodeo starred 1up staffers Sean Malloy, Ryan Scott, Sean Elliot, Jeff Green, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.  On September 11th, 2008, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and on September 18th, Sean Elliot did the same.  I wrote a little bit about it on that day: <a href="/old/v7/the-brodeo-is-over" title="/the-brodeo-is-over">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=491</a>.</p><p>It was my favorite because they had the perfect blend of serious game discussion and deconstruction, mixed with clever humor and ridiculous bizarre stories.  Jeff Green spoke very candidly and honestly about his life and thoughts on games.  Shawn Eliott would regale ridiculous stories from the past, while going into depth about ideas and game design.  Robert Ashley would provide great commentary and further insight into the conversation.  Ryan Scott...  wouldn't say much.  Anthony Gallegos was a goof ball.</p><p>This round table always made the conversation revolve in the right direction that was entertaining and thought provoking.  If you haven't listened to GFW Radio, definitely check out all the previous episodes.  Yes, it's a PC podcast, but PC gaming is a very small component of what makes the podcast so great.  All the podcasts are still hosted at 1up.com's <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397">GFW podcast page</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>The Fans</b></div><p>Being at The Brodeo reunion was a reunion for everyone in the room.  It wasn't just a reunion for the Brodeo members, but all the fans, too.  All the fans listened, laughed, and thought in unison while The Brodeo talked about Diapered Anime fans, working in Game Development, playing games no longer being Journalists, Smoking poop, and the Truth behind GFW Magazine's end.</p><p>The Brodeo crew have a very unique voice, but the fans really bring out the best in them.  In fact, it was fan Aaron Simmer who contacted all the Brodeo members, raised money to fly them to PAX, created the Panel, reserved the room, and organized the entire event for them.  It was Bill Mudron who created this excellent Graphic for the reunion, printed out 200 poster sized copies, and sold them at the Panel for $2 to cover the cost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp"  /></p><p>(I was able to get all 5 Brodeo member signatures on my poster, too!)</p><p>And it was all the fans that showed up and gave their attention, their laughter and their questions that brought out the familiarity and comfort of being with like minds and friends.</p><div class='title'><b>The Reunion</b></div><p>Much like every episode of The Brodeo, they talked well past their allotted 1 hour mark.

The demo had been out for quite a while, and the game just came out that week.  It didn't really need advertising or a large presence.  There was a life-sized Big Daddy statue and several demo units, but that was about it.</p><p>This year, Bioshock 2 had a pretty small presence, but what they had was rather unique.  2k Game hired a chalk artist to sketch a poster in front of the main halls.  Throughout the entire weekend, the artist worked on transposing the tiny print into a massive 8 foot mural.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Jhonen Vasquez</b></div><p>Earlier in the year, Jhonen Vasquez, creator of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Squee, and Invader Zim, drew a picture that captured the twisted essence of the little sisters and their bigger guardians.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp"  /></p><p>2k Games brought Vasquez to Comic-Con in July (even though he would already be there for Slave Labor Graphics), and they did the same with PAX.  On Saturday, from 2pm to 4pm, Vasquez sat in Andrew Ryan's office signing these prints.  The one above is the one I got. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, Vasquez was only signing these prints and was not signing personal items. That's fine, since I didn't have any of that with me anyways.  I would love his signature on the side of my Invader Zim box set, or on the inside cover of Johnny or Squee.  Someday, but unfortunately, not today.</p><p>I did get my photograph taken with him...  sort of.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp"  /></p><p>In the background is his handler.  I did ask him if Vasquez could sign anything else, but he was the one that kindly told me, "no, sorry."  I chatted with him a little bit about when I might be able to get his signature and he suggested Comic Con next year.  Bahh...</p><p>If you were to guess what Vasquez's handler's voice sounded like, would you think it would be a deep rough lumberjack of a voice?  Perhaps a strong authoritative dialogue?  I'm afraid not.  His voice was straight out of Suburban Commando.  Semi-high pitched, with a very rich English accent, recanted with an apologetic smile.  Is that a typical voice for such a burly man in England?</p><p>I wonder if Vasquez attends comic conventions other than Comic Con.  Comic Con sounds like a shit load of lines, and huge price guaging.  I'm not even sure I would buy anything there, as I already have all the comics I need.  Plus, I hate Superhero comics, so it probably wouldn't be fun for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Bioshock errata</b></div><p>Those two events were really the only presence of Bioshock 2 at PAX.  There was a room in teh back that showed the E3 trailer over and over.  Those that watched the trailer were rewarded with a Bioshock 2 posters draw by Gabe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp"  /></p><p>It's hilarious comparing Gabe's drawing to Jhonen Vasquez's print.  Cute v. Creepy.  Calm v. Twisted.  <b>The ying and yang of Bioshock 2 art.</b></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Behemoth and Game 3 Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-behemoth-and-game-3-hands-on">PAX 09: Behemoth and Game 3 Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The revenue generated from their booth at PAX directly funds their upcoming games.  It's win/win.</p><div class='title'><b>Castle Crashers</b></div><p>Last year, having just released Castle Crashers, their merchandise was almost all focused on Castle Crashers.  They were selling shirts, figures, and the game.  I bought the full game from them last year that came with a fancy pewter medallion and a code for the game.  It was certainly more tangible that simply buying it through Xbox live.</p><p>Castle Crashers was definitely my favorite downloadable game last year.  After buying the game at PAX 08, we played it so much that I missed my flight home!  <a href="/old/v7/pax-castle-crashers" title="/pax-castle-crashers">Read all about it</a>.  This year I continued my patronage and purchased a statue of my favorite Castle Crashers character (for sale): The Red Knight.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp"  /></p><p>Steam Knight is actually my favorite, but they haven't made a figure for him.  Dan Paladin was at the Behemoth booth, so I asking him if he would sign my spiffy figure.  And he did!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp"  /></p><p>Also, there was a Castle Crashers cosplayer at the booth.  I'm pretty sure it was one of their friends or wives and not just a random fan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Game 3</b></div><p>The Behemoth booth had 4 stations setup.  One had PS3 Castle Crashers, and the other one had Game 3 setup on the Xbox.  I gave it a try and it seems like it might be fun.</p><p>Each game developed by Behemoth has been in a different genre, mostly in the retro realm.  Alien Hominid was a 2D sidescrolling shooter, ala Contra or Metal Slug.  Castle Crashers was a brawler ala Final Fight and TMNT.  But, Game 3 doesn't fall into a specific genre.</p><p>It's very much a multiplayer action game.  Again, it seems like it'll be fun, but I didn't really have that much fun with it at PAX.  The game mode we played had a floating whale that gave out coins.  You pick up as many coins at possible and deposit them in a floating bank.  The opposing team can knock you out and steal your coins, so be careful!  It was simple, and didn't have much more to it other than jumping around.</p><p>I love the art, though.  You can choose your head, face and weapon.  The faces range from stern to excited to intense.  The weapons can be defensive or offensive.  I played with a fan, which repeled most projectile weapons.</p><p>The Behemoth's Development Video #1 shows exactly how the game is played.  I didn't get much more out of the game having already seen this video.

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has been the only RPG in recent years that actually hooked me.  Fallout 3 I found boring and dismal.  Fable II was ugly and too ridiculous.  JRPGs (except Final Fantasy XII) haven't had a unique or different story for quite a while.  But Mass Effect was a little different.  It was a fully realized NEW Sci Fi universe, much like Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc, etc.</p><p>There are very few games that create an in-depth detailed universe for their game that aren't in the MMO space.  There are even less that have a decent story that unravels through a decent plot and utilizes many aspects of that lore.  There's a lot of lore fluff that doesn't matter for the story of Jonathon Shepherd, but I find myself more interested in reading about these alien races, than some ancient Orcs v. Human battle in the WOW lore.  I think alien races have always intrigued me because they are so different from us, but still have the capacity for intelligence.</p><p>I'm quite excited for the sequel, so I was glad to get the chance to check it out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>One thing that was goofy about Mass Effect 1 were the dialogue scenes.  The dialogue wasn't goofy, but the way in which it presented always had a profile shot of who was talking.  That was the only shot they ever used, and it got boring fast.</p><p>The dialogue in Mass Effect 2 has a lot going on in the background.  The shots are more dynamic and have more interaction that just conversation.  For example: At the beginning of the demo, you hold a conversation in a car while flying to your destination.  The only interaction you have is conversation, but the shots change from a close-up in-car to a wide shot of the city's traffic, to a closer shot outside the car with character visible through the windows.  It's a varied and shows off how beautiful the environments are.  It's far more interesting that two people standing side-by-side holding a conversation.</p><p>The conversations towards the end of the demo has a whole lot of body movement and gestures that really enhance the actually dialogue.  It's like an actual movie now!</p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>Another "gamey" thing about the dialogue that has been altered is that the conversation choices are not so black and white.  After a while of playing Mass Effect 1, you'll realize that the 3 conversation choices on the right go in order of Good, Neutral, and Evil.  If you want to be good in the game, you'll most likely always say the top choice.  For evil, the bottom choice.  Why ever choose the middle?</p><p>It wasn't so easy to tell if the top choice was actually the "Good" choice towards the end of the demo.  In fact, choosing the top choice invoked a battle that I found out could have been avoided.  Maybe it was the Good choice and I appeared weak?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Other Thoughts</b></div><p>The demo was very very pretty.  It was pretty dark, but featured a rich color palette the made areas look very dynamic and cool.  A very Sci Fi style that is much more prevalent than the first game.  It looks great. ^_^</p><p>The action sequence also felt much different than Mass Effect 1.  I actually needed precision and strategy when fighting all the enemies, rather than blowing them all away with my sniper rifle or using my team as decoys.  It was kinda difficult.  I should've checked which class I was playing.</p><p>But overall, the game is pretty sweet.

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Sunday morning, instead of standing in line to view the exhibition hall for the 3rd day in a row, Five and I lined up for The Old Republic demonstration.  This was the second demo of The Old Republic at PAX this year.  We didn't go to the Saturday demo because we figured it would be too crowded and didn't want to stand in line forever.  Sunday was much more laid back.</p><p>During the Saturday demo, Bioware announced the release of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Steam.  The also announced that everyone watching the demo will receive a full copy of the game!  This was also true for the Sunday crowd!  So, it's installing on my computer right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Star Wars The Old Republic is a story-driven MMORPG.  Every MMO these days has a story but no one gives a shit.  When I talked with NPCs in World of Warcraft, I just clicked through the conversation and didn't read a single thing.  Who cares, really?  What they say might be interesting, but it's all text and presented in a way that I don't care a single bit.  Especially when my friends have already started running down the trail, and I can't read that fast.</p><p>But it's not important for how the game is played.  What that NPC says bears no difference and how I kill the enemies he wants me to.  He should just say, "go to this dungeon and kill this boss."</p><p>Bioware says the story in an RPG is key and it should be no different for MMORPGs.  This sounds incredibly ambitious, since it has never happened before.  It also ambitious to make an MMO period, because World of Warcraft owns that space.  Why compete with the most successful MMO in history?</p><div class='title'><b>Online</b></div><p>Because they aren't.  In fact, thinking of The Old Republic in terms of an MMO skews the basic perception of this game.  The reason story will work in The Old Republic is because it's an RPG first.</p><p>They've basically made a single player RPG with the core focus of story and conversation in all Bioware games, but made it multiplayer.  Instead of making a party of NPCs, those NPCs are now your friends or other player characters.  And Instead of one party member hosting the game, it's all on a single server that everyone plays on.</p><p>You'll run into everyone else playing through their story.  And since The Old Republic has many branching story paths and a morality system you are judged by, the world and story will be shaped by the things that you do and things that people you play with do.  So, it'll be different (to a degree) for everyone.</p><p><b>The Old Republic is really just KOTOR Online</b>, but everyone is playing it at once.  Plus there's PVP and an economy and item crafting.  All the fun of an MMORPG has been squished into the KOTOR universe.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Thinking of The Old Republic is those terms makes me think that it will succeed in its promise to bring story to an MMO.  Because they're actually just bringing the MMO space to a story, which is the right way to approach it.  I was intrigued with the idea to begin with, but now I'm all for it.  I definitely plan on giving The Old Republic a try. ^_^</p><p>The Old Republic is schedule for release in 2010 on the PC.  Hopefully, my computer can play it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp"  /></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/pax/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
