| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On Sunday morning, instead of standing in line to view the exhibition hall for the 3rd day in a row, Five and I lined up for The Old Republic demonstration.  This was the second demo of The Old Republic at PAX this year.  We didn't go to the Saturday demo because we figured it would be too crowded and didn't want to stand in line forever.  Sunday was much more laid back.</p><p>During the Saturday demo, Bioware announced the release of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Steam.  The also announced that everyone watching the demo will receive a full copy of the game!  This was also true for the Sunday crowd!  So, it's installing on my computer right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Star Wars The Old Republic is a story-driven MMORPG.  Every MMO these days has a story but no one gives a shit.  When I talked with NPCs in World of Warcraft, I just clicked through the conversation and didn't read a single thing.  Who cares, really?  What they say might be interesting, but it's all text and presented in a way that I don't care a single bit.  Especially when my friends have already started running down the trail, and I can't read that fast.</p><p>But it's not important for how the game is played.  What that NPC says bears no difference and how I kill the enemies he wants me to.  He should just say, "go to this dungeon and kill this boss."</p><p>Bioware says the story in an RPG is key and it should be no different for MMORPGs.  This sounds incredibly ambitious, since it has never happened before.  It also ambitious to make an MMO period, because World of Warcraft owns that space.  Why compete with the most successful MMO in history?</p><div class='title'><b>Online</b></div><p>Because they aren't.  In fact, thinking of The Old Republic in terms of an MMO skews the basic perception of this game.  The reason story will work in The Old Republic is because it's an RPG first.</p><p>They've basically made a single player RPG with the core focus of story and conversation in all Bioware games, but made it multiplayer.  Instead of making a party of NPCs, those NPCs are now your friends or other player characters.  And Instead of one party member hosting the game, it's all on a single server that everyone plays on.</p><p>You'll run into everyone else playing through their story.  And since The Old Republic has many branching story paths and a morality system you are judged by, the world and story will be shaped by the things that you do and things that people you play with do.  So, it'll be different (to a degree) for everyone.</p><p><b>The Old Republic is really just KOTOR Online</b>, but everyone is playing it at once.  Plus there's PVP and an economy and item crafting.  All the fun of an MMORPG has been squished into the KOTOR universe.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Thinking of The Old Republic is those terms makes me think that it will succeed in its promise to bring story to an MMO.  Because they're actually just bringing the MMO space to a story, which is the right way to approach it.  I was intrigued with the idea to begin with, but now I'm all for it.  I definitely plan on giving The Old Republic a try. ^_^</p><p>The Old Republic is schedule for release in 2010 on the PC.  Hopefully, my computer can play it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp"  /><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Heavy Rain Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-heavy-rain-hands-on">PAX 09: Heavy Rain Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I was really surprised to see Heavy Rain at PAX.  There hasn't been a lot of trailers or press releases over the past 2 or 3 years.  We've really only seen bits and pieces other than what the gaming press writes about after seeing a demo.  Even then, there haven't been many press demos of the game either.  Was Heavy Rain even at E3 this year?</p><p>I'm really intrigued by Heavy Rain because it's different.  It's not an FPS, it's not an adventure game.  It's an interactive movie, really.  It is a lot like Dragon's Lair or Space Ace from the early 90s.  It is entirely played by quick time events and conversation choices.  Though, you can move about the environment when given the opportunity.  I guess, you could call it the modern day adaptation of an old Lucas Arts or Sierra adventure game.</p><div class='title'><b>Demo</b></div><p>The PAX Demo (which was labeled GDC demo) put you in a convenience store.  You're trying to get information from the store clerk.  You could probably get the information with the correct conversation sequence, but I never saw anyone complete it.  After you piss him off, you go to the back to get an inhaler, when a perp busts in the door and holds up the clerk at gun point.  He doesn't notice you in the back.</p><p>You can carefully creep up behind him and knock him over the head with a frying pan or a bottle of whiskey, but there are several Quick Time Events to blow your approach.  I didn't see anyone successfully reach the perp without him noticing.  You need to put your hands in the air or else he'll shoot!  And then you go through a conversation sequence that will make him leave.  I didn't see anyone do that successfully.</p><p>Each time you say something, you'll inch close enough.  So, after you talk with him for a while, you'll be close enough to start fighting him.  Press X here, Shake the controller there, and you've knocked him out!  You gain the clerk's trust and get the information you wanted.  Taa-daa~!</p><p>When I played, I fucked up when approaching the perp.  I wasn't about the put my hands up, so I kept them down.  And the perp shot me through the shoulder.  He ran out the door after that, and that gained the clerks trust.  I would really like to see the other outcomes that were available, but most people screwed up and did the same thing over and over again, so it was boring after the 5th time.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Heavy Rain is a very beautiful looking game.  The only environment from the demo was the convenience store, but it had an incredible amount of detail.  Everything on the shelves had individual labels.  The few ceiling lights cast very dark shadows in the dimly lit store.  It was very rich.  I can't wait to see what the rest of the game looks like. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp"  /></p><p>The demo did not turn me off one bit.  In fact, after playing the demo for Heavy Rain I'm more excited than ever to play this game.  I can't wait. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Release</b></div><p>Heavy Rain is only available for Playstation 3 and should be released "Early 2010", just like everything else that was supposed to come out this year.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Dead Space Extraction Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-dead-space-extraction-hands-on">PAX 09: Dead Space Extraction Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>There weren't many games in fall 08 that lived up to the hype, except Dead Space.  After playing <a href="/old/v7/pax-dead-space-hands-on" title="/pax-dead-space-hands-on" title="/pax-dead-space-hands-on">Dead Space at PAX 08</a>, I was sold.  Dead Space had a very rich atmosphere compiled by an organic sci-fi environment and detailed distinct sharp sound quality.  My hype was vindicated when I played through the game in one sitting.</p><p>Dead Space Extraction is the complete opposite of everything that made the original so fantastic.  It's not an adventure game at all; it's an on-rails action game.  The brilliance of Dead Space was suspense.  Because the player had complete control over the movement of the main character, Isaac, you controlled the suspense.  The player could slow down if the suspense was too much, or take on the situation without thinking twice.</p><p>All of that is completely removed from Dead Space Extraction because you are not in control.  You just shoot monsters when the pop out of walls and run at you.  There's absolutely no suspense, so why even bother.  Dead Space Extraction does not nothing to differentiate itself from House of the Dead, or any other on-rails shooters.  Shoot, Reload, Pick up Ammo, Repeat, Fight Boss.  I'm not even sure I would like it even if I wasn't such a fan of the first game.</p><p>Extraction shouldn't even be considered as the "next" Dead Space game.  It's just a set piece for providing background story in the overall Dead Space universe.  I don't think many people really care about that.  And your standard Wii owner is definitely not going to care about it.<br/>____</p><p>Dead Space Extraction releases on the Wii sometime this fall.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Dragon Age Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-dragon-age-impressions">PAX: Dragon Age Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Hahah. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure why you'd really want World of Warcraft: Wraith of the Lich King on a playable kiosk, anyways.  All you'd really want to show off is the Death Knight and some of the new areas.  For a little while, I watched one guy play and he was a Gnome Warrior running around...  What a waste of time.  They did have some demonstrations of Lich King, though, so it wasn't all a waste.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Spore Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-spore-impressions">PAX: Spore Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

DC ready for play.  Each game had 10 playable characters: 5 MK characters and 5 DC characters.  On the Mortal Kombat side, you could fight as Scorpion, Subzero, Shang Tsung, Kitana, and...  someone else.  Maybe Liu Kang.  For DC, you could choose Superman, Batman, Cat Woman, The Flash or The Joker.</p><p>Nearly everyone playing choose a DC character.  That makes sense though.  The DC characters are new to the franchise, whereas Scorpion and Subzero have been there since the beginning.  We want to try out new things, rather than simply win the fight.</p><p>I was tempted to choose Superman, but I fought as The Flash since he seemed more my style of fighting character.  Fast quick flurry of moves, and ease of getting into combat and fleeing quickly.  Five choose Kitana, who no one really used at all.  Equal Opportunity!</p><p>After a heated awkward battle, I barely won after learning a neat move or two.</p><p>There really isn't much to say about MK v. DC other than, yes, it <i>is</i> definitely Mortal Kombat.  When fighting as The Flash, it felt like another move-set for an MK character, but with Superhero-like moves.  I think they did a great job pulling the DC Superheroes into the Mortal Kombat universe...  other than the exception that any character can defeat Superman.  I think that's bullshit, but you can't have a DC game without Superman.  Oh well.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun. ^_^  Once again, it reminds me of playing fighting games back at the SPAMM haus.  There were those couple of months we played Mortal Kombat V on the Gamecube.  It'll make a great addition to any circle of friend's nightly gaming session.  But, for me, I think I'll stick with Soul Caliber IV.  Mortal Kombat does not compare to the depth and artistic quality of Soul Caliber.<br/>____</p><p>It should be noted that Mortal Kombat v. DC will be released for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 sometime this fall.  Gamefaqs says mid-November.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Castle Crashers" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-castle-crashers">PAX: Castle Crashers</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
