| October 31, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today marked the second time in two weeks that Destructoid had an article about Phantasmagoria cross its front pages.  Is there some Roberta Williams rival going on that I don't know about?  I guess with the release of Manhunt 2, they're trying to pull in similarities since Phantasmagoria is one of the goriest games to ever be released.</p><p>What better day than Halloween for me to write about it as well. ^_^</p><p>Here are the two articles, complete with youtube videos..<br/><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/phantasmagoria-makes-murder-look-as-sexy-as-it-was-in-the-old-days-49210.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/phantasmagoria-makes-murder-look-as-sexy-as-it-was-in-the-old-days-49210.phtml">Article #1: Phantasmagoria makes murder sexy</a><br/><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/why-phantasmagoria-is-awesome-and-why-it-could-never-be-released-today--52024.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/why-phantasmagoria-is-awesome-and-why-it-could-never-be-released-today--52024.phtml">Article #2: Why phantasmagoria would never be released today</a></p><p>Looking at the "gore" and murder today is far more comical than horrific, like it was supposed to be back in the day.  A lot of these murders are more submissive and sexual given a man overpowering a woman and killing her in bizarre methods..</p><div class='title'><b>Nostalgia</b></div><p>My first brush with Phantasmagoria was at a relative's house.  They had it on their computer along with Sim City 2000 and a couple other games.  I was playing Sim City for a little while and noticed Phantasmagoria and wanted to play it.  They gave me the 'ol.. "No no.. this game is for adults" speech.  O_o..  I really wasn't THAT young at this point in time..  I guess they didn't want to get in trouble with my parents or something..</p><p>Later on in the week, I asked my Dad if he'd buy me the game and a day or two later, huzzah!  Phantasmagoria for the Macintosh Power PC was mine!  Next time I'm home, I really need to search around for that game..  It's gotta be somewhere..  even though, it wouldn't be able to run on anything these days.  (at least, nothing i own)</p><p>The game was 7 discs: one for each chapter.  It reminded me a lot of my Sega CD games, like Sewer Shark and Texas Ground Zero.  Nothing but Full Motion Video mixed in with gameplay elements..</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>Unfortunately, I didn't get very far in the game.  I completed disc 1, but nothing interesting really happened..  I got a little bit into disc 2, but got stuck and didn't know what to do..  It seemed kinda boring..  I popped in the other discs to see if I could watch the FMV or something, but I actually found something much more useful..  You could begin any chapter you wanted with finishing those before it.  Keen!</p><p>I immediately went to disc 7 to try and beat the game.  Disc 7 really had no exploring at all.  You husband, Don, was completely possessed by the ghost in the mansion, and you're running for you life.  You find a couple items while trying to escape but eventually get caught.</p><p>You wake up from unconsciousness to find Don strapping you into a killing machine.  With the items you have on you, you must escape his clutches.  Apparently, you're supposed to distract him, escape from the chair, and seal the evil vortex in the basement.  I could never do it correctly..  whatever item combination I was supposed to use, I either didn't have or it was not obvious.</p><p>I found a hammer earlier, so I beat Don over the head with it. That certainly distracted him long enough for me to escape the chair before it sliced my head in two..  but then I run down to the basement and I'm giving one chance to do something about this vortex.  All I have is a fricken hammer..  I must've missed something on the way..  Oh well, too late.. the demon came out of the vortex and tore my face off.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>I'd love to go back and play through the whole game, even though it is horribly dated.  I never played any of the Kings Quest or Police Quest games, so this is really my only connection to Roberta Williams..</p><p>These games had really died off thanks to the advancement of modern gaming.  Between gameplay and graphics, story telling on par with motion pictures never really came into the picture.  These days, every single game involves some type of story presented in a very cinematic way.  If your game doesn't have a story, then it's crap.</p><p>The only adventure games you can find these days are on platforms that haven't become graphically intense enough to match modern console gaming..  like the Flash Player and Nintendo DS.  Phoenix Wright and Touch Detective are king on the DS for this reason, but are still over looked because "it's like reading a book."  Their console counterparts are much more alluring.  You want to play the story, not Choose-your-own-adventure.</p><p>After Phantasmagoria, Williams made one more King's Quest game and then effectively retired from gaming in 1998.  Nearly a decade has past, but her games still live on in gamers.  Especially Destructoid writers ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Heroes Speculation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/heroes-speculation">Heroes Speculation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of last night's episode Hero, the plot for the whole season seemed to emerge.  Especially with the trailer for the next episode.  Peter makes his way to Canada, finds stuff in the helix marked apartment and moves into the future with the irish girl.  They find themselves in downtown New York (against a green screen), where the streets are deserted and full of trash..  A slightly different apocolyptic vision than Hiro saw last season..</p><p>Hiro went into the future twice in season 1.  The first time was a glimpse of New York right before "the bomb" went off.  The second time was a few years after that with New York in ruins and the public going ape-shit after mutants.</p><p>The future that Peter has traveled to shows that by stopping "the bomb" last season, they did INDEED change the future.  I guess we already knew that, though..  The date and time of "the bomb's" explosion had already passed from what it should have been.</p><p>Peter picks up a piece of paper that reads "Evacution, June 2008", which puts them near the date of the final episode of Season 2.  The trailer goes on to say that 93% of the population was killed by a virus.. Most likely, the very virus Mohinder and Bob were talking about earlier to reverse mutants back into normal humans.  Looks like, in the future, Mohinder has failed in suspressing the company from making a virus/vacine..</p><p>It seems like they're following the same pattern from last season.  Catching a glimspe into the future reveals a catastrophic event only they can stop.  Save the cheerleader, Save the world..  what's the tagline going to be this time?  Stop the company, Save the world?  Stop parker's father, save the world?</p><p>I wonder when the first hiatus is....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freaks and Geeks further thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">Freaks and Geeks further thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After purchasing the Freaks and Geeks box set on Friday, I've really binged on the show.  Between Friday and Saturday morning, I watched the first 3 of the DVDs, totaling 9 episodes, an hour each.  Saturday night, I watched the next 2 DVDs by myself, and now I'm down to one remaining.</p><p>The more you get into this show, the formula really begins to set in.  I think the best way to describe this show is a mix between an after-school special, That 70s Show, and the Wonder years.  Most of the geeky jokes in the movie are really time centric with taking place in 1980.  A star wars reference here..  a star trek reference there..  Dallas, Welcome back Cotter..  It's the same formula that That 70s Show did until it began focusing on the characters.</p><p>This show has really begun to depress me, so I'm not really sure why I decided to binge on another six episodes..  I guess I couldn't stay away..  I think I'm going to lock up those final 3 episodes to watch them later on in the future.  How fitting that these final 3 episodes were never aired until ABC family picked up the syndication rights..</p><p>My old Madison roommates are somewhat on the same mind, but with Knocked Up, inside of Freaks and Geeks.  One of them relates to that movie with the same disdain because that was a life he almost lead.  The same feelings of entrapment and solid future were those he couldn't handle.</p><div class='title'><b>Suburbia</b></div><p>Freaks and Geeks really reminds me of the first Richard Linklater movie I saw..  Suburbia.  The first time I saw this movie, I was in awe with its realism.  Much like Freaks and Geeks, It really stuck with me for the next couple of days.</p><p>I've only seen it once, so I'm somewhat hazy on what point in time it takes place.  It was the last night in early September before all these high school friends went to college, the army, and another had a record deal.  This was the last day of their lives as citizen of their suburban town before they ventured into the world.  I think the year was 1985, or something like that.</p><p>Since it was their last night, they went through a wide range of emotions..  celebration, excitement, fear, loss..  pre-mature homesickness..  Their venture into the unknown..  A world outside theiir own.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>I saw this movie when I was a sophomore or junior in high school, so I viewed it as the same sort of fears I was supposed to have once I finished high school..  except I had no clue what the hell I was going to do at the time.</p><p>I was somewhat excited for this moment to happen for me..  To be at that point of no return with my high school friends, say goodbye for the final time and really feel for each other..  That never came for me..  Really, It was only until the end of last year and leaving Japan that I had that moment..  A conversation that ended on the tone that I would never see you again and I'm glad I met you...</p><p>That moment was real..  The moment was heartfelt..  With all my other friends in Japan..  I just turn on my computer and they're all on Instant Messenger..  but with that one person and that one moment.  It was the edge of the universe..</p><div class='title'><b>Scanner Darkly</b></div><p>Out of all other Linklater's movies, Scanner Darkly is the only other one that scratches at my emotions on some level.  There's only a few scenes that convey that slice of life feel, but I see myself in them none-the-less.  I think I'll leave it at that though...</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Now that I've seen Freaks and Geeks, I must see Undeclared.  I must see Judd Apatow's second building block of his cast of social rejects..  but, I really don't want to buy it.  I love Freaks and Geeks, but I probably could have gotten away with just borrowing it from someone..  I'll probably watch it again with someone who hasn't seen it, but never on my own.</p><p>There are a bunch of other TV shows I'd like to see too, like My So Called Life (as recommended by Erika), Californication, Weeds, Carnivale...  I'd also like to pick up where I left off with Six Feet Under (even though, Matt says the rest is dull).</p><p>Soooo....  maybe I'll start up a netflix account.  After comparing Blockbuster online versus Netflix, I think I'll definitely go with Netflix.  If Blockbuster had a video game service mixed in with DVDs, then there'd be no contest, but they don't.  And with their prices exactly the same, It really comes down to selection and with more Television shows, Anime, and obscure foreign movies Netflix has Blockbuster beat. Also, If I miss an episode of Heroes, I can watch it from netflix.com rather than nbc's crappy browser player.</p><p>I wonder how long it would take to get Undeclared disc 1 if I signed up now....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freaks and Geeks" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, I picked up the boxset of Freaks and Geeks, which contains all 18 episodes of the short-lived series.  I've so many things about this show and after watching Knocked Up and Superbad, I was really excited for it.  We watched about 6 or 7 episodes last night, and watched the remainder of the third disc this morning.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I really thought this show was going to be much more of a comedy than a drama.  I figured it was more on the lines of Undeclared, but I was way off.  I also thought each episode was going to be 30 minutes, but I was off on that too.  There's a lot more to this show than I expected which really through me back..</p><p>Freaks and Geeks is about freaks and geeks..  Set in 1980, it centers on Sam Weir, a freshmen high school who fails into the geek category of the show.  And centers on Lindsey Weir who is a junior or senior at the same high school.  She rejects her 'braininess' and wants to hang out with the 'cool' kids.. the 'freaks' category, which would be burnouts.</p><p>This show is incredible.  It is incredibly real and way too accurate that it's almost too much for me.  Freaks and Geeks fills me with so much sentiment, nostalgia, and memories of my own life in high school.  Good times, Bad times..  It's not like watching Back to the Future for the first time in 10 years and thinking back to the first time you saw this masterpiece..  It's living your life again..  too many social cares..  rejection..  affliation..  acceptance..  It's like watching a home movie of your life at age 14.</p><p>This slice of life is too big for me to handle..  It's really not a case of whether I like this show or not..  I feel like this show is me..  It's too good..  which is why it was cancelled. :/</p><p>I'll probably watch the rest of it tonight and tomorrow.</p><div class='title'><b>Judd Appatow</b></div><p>After Freaks and Geeks was cancelled, Judd Apatow (co-creator) went with a more comedic approach to the 'Freaks and Geeks' feel..  Undeclared was his next show, which featured 'Freaks and Geeks' in college.  Jocks became Frat boys..  Cheerleaders became Sorority girls..  but the social outcasts, where still outcasts.</p><p>It premiered on Fox, which probably doomed the show from the start.  It also only lasted one season.  I only remember seeing part of an episode, but I don't really remember it.  From what I remember, this is way more lighthearted than Freaks and Geeks.</p><p>Apparently, Judd Apatow has three other unaired television series that seem similar.  "Life on Parole", "North Hollywood", and "Sick in the Head".  Pilots were created for these three series, but they were very aired.</p><p>I guess the average TV viewer and Judd Apatow don't mix.  It's a damn shame though..  As far as popularity though, Apatow really struck it rich in the movies..  He hung with Will Ferril for a bit, and produced Anchorman, Kicking & Screaming (will ferril's crappy soccer movie), and Talladega Nights.</p><p>But his real talent lies in bringing slices of life into the theater..  He still comes back to the 'Freaks and Geeks' social groups, and made 3 movies in different points in time.  At the age 40 timeline, there's 40 year old virgin.  At the age 23-25 timeline, there's knocked up.  And at the age 18 timeline, there's Superbad.  You may not be the main characters in these movies, but chances are there's a character you relate to.</p><p>Another interesting fact is that Seth Rogen is in all 5 of Apatow's "slice of life" dramedies, and also several other actors and actresses as well.  Judd Apatow really doesn't give much direction when working with his talents, he produces these movies highlighting his talent's natural persona and let's them go loose.</p><div class='title'><b>Six Degrees of Separation</b></div><p>Besides Seth Rogen, Apatow reuses a lot of the talent that has been in his properties, and even the talent themselves have appeared in other films and TV together..  maybe its because when someone makes a geeky or burnout movie, these guys are the best candidates?  maybe its coincidence..?  fate..?  or perhaps they just like each ^_^.</p><p>I made <a href="/pages/apatow.html" title="/pages/apatow.html">a page</a> with all these social links.  Thank you, IMDB.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Further Beautiful Katamari Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts">Further Beautiful Katamari Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 24, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After being so pissed off at Beautiful Katamari on the first day, and ranting about how annoying stupid the game is.. tonight I was able to get passed that and play through the game thinking of fond memories of We Love Katamari..</p><div class='title'><b>Stages</b></div><p>All told, Beautiful Katamari has 16 stages..  10 main stages, 2 variety stages, and 4 downloadable stages which are released today on Xbox Live marketplace.  How many stages did We Love Katamari have?  Weren't there 8 main stages, and 8 or 10 variety stages?</p><p>We Love Katamari had some very pretty innovative levels.. like the cloud level, where you only roll up clouds.  the firefly level, where you're at a camp site in the evening, and roll up all the fireflies you see.  During the credits, you could roll up all the continents on earth..  and There was another level where you could roll up all the planets and satellites you've made throughout the game.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari has one rather unique level which is unlocked after you complete the game.  You are rolling around the King through his infancy, through his childhood, up to adulthood.  Throughout this process, the King asks you to roll up specific items to "jog" his memory of his lifetime.  "Roll up ocean objects.. it reminds me of my adventures on the sea," he says.  This level has no time limit, so you can really have fun with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Scale</b></div><p>With each successive Katamari game, they push the eventual maximum size you can reach, usually by limiting the size of the levels.  In Katamari Damacy, you started the size of a thumbtack, and grew big enough to roll around on island picking up skyscrappers and huge forests.  We Love Katamari did them on better, in the final stage, you grow big enough to escape the island and roll up other islands, eventually getting big enough to roll up the island you began on..  eventually, the maximum size you could reach was between 3,000 and 4,000 meters.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari grows exponentially larger than that..  Quite similarly, the final level you begin about the size of a potted plant, and continue to grow.  When you reach the size you were in We Love Katamari, you're able to escape the little island region you began on and can roll around the world picking up massive forests and island countries..  This is A LOT like the ending of We Love Katamari where you pick up continents.  Eventually you grow large enough to pick up all the continents on earth, and big enough to escape Earth.  Then you float around space picking up other planets, and eventually Earth..  This is much like that special level in We Love Katamari.</p><p>So, you began the size of a bread basket and grow larger than the Sun to a maximum total of around 1,500,000 kilometers..  Unfortunately, you can't reach that diameter until you unlock the extra 4 levels for their planets to be in that level to roll up.</p><p>Despite it's failings, the final main level, and the King level are pretty fun..  A reward for walking through all the shit to get there.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, the game is still unimaginative and only offers Scale as a new feature.  Where We Love Katamari was making steps in the right direction, Beautiful Katamari took all those steps back and offers very little with an occasionally broken points system.</p><p>I'm a big fan of Katamari, so I kept with it.  I think most people would probably quit after getting constantly beat down on those first couple of levels.  There really isn't a reason to keep going, unless you really want to play the final level.</p><p>Today, on Xbox Live, you can purchase 4 additional levels that should have been included with the game for $10 total..  I will probably purchase them to see what they really offer..  They are probably 4 variety levels, so, once again, I have my hopes up for something that'll blow me away as some of the levels in We Love Katamari did.</p><div class='title'><b>In other news</b></div><p>I picked up Castlevania on PSP today, but I want to finish up with Beautiful Katamari and Gurumin first, before playing it..  Technically, I beat Gurumin already, but I got the sad ending.  To get the good ending, I need to go through and finish all the stages in the game, of which I missed 5 or 6. So there's not much left to do.  Gurumin is a great game, btw ^_^. I could finish that up in one night, easily.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Beautiful Katamari Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/beautiful-katamari-impressions">Beautiful Katamari Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, I went on a brisk walk down to Gamestop to pick up Castlevania and Phoenix Wright, but unfortunately I was a day too early.. Apparently games come out on Wednesday these days.. On the way back I stopped off at Circuit City, Shopko, and eventually found myself at Blockbuster. What luck! They had copies of Beautiful Katamari in stock, which was released for the 360 last week.</p><p>I probably would've already owned the game, except $40 is entirely too much for this game, even without knowing if it was any good. The rental price of $8 seemed the perfect fit.</p><p>Unfortunately, every aspect of Beautiful Katamari seems inferior or par to its previous console title, We Love Katamari. There are two things that are identical to We Love Katamari, the graphics and the loading times.</p><div class='title'><b>Par Graphics</b></div><p>Beautiful Katamari looks identical to We Love Katamari.. The same blocky environment and 3D models are all present in this new "High-Def" presentation. The same solid color lack-of-textured items cover the environment for you to roll up into your Katamari.</p><p>With the power of the 360 behind this game, you'd think they'd do something innovative with the graphics.. Perhaps add a ton of objects into the universe, rather than the slightly more than you'd find on a PS2. Why not extend the graphics just a little more, or have more diverse objects? Beautiful Katamari has 1000 unique objects.. the same amount as We Love Katamari.</p><div class='title'><b>Par Loading Times</b></div><p>Also on with PS2 are the loading times.. Does it really take the 360 the same time to load a Playstation 2 quality environment as the Playstation 2? When you move from area to area why does it load on occasion? Why is there still a little bit of loading when you grow to a certain size? It doesn't make sense why you would need so much loading for this game... This is pure laziness..</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Gameplay</b></div><p>The main gameplay concept of Katamari is to roll around, pick up objects, and increase your ball larger and larger until your Katamari's diameter meets the goal for the level before the timer runs out. We Love Katamari added some new innovations by having other goals, like rolling up food, clouds, fireflies in some beautiful environments.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari takes both these concepts and rolls them into the main goal of the level. You still have size requirements and a timer, but on each level, your katamari must contain a majority of a certain group of items. One level, you begin rolling around in a Casino and the majority of items must be expensive things. In every level I've played, this has been the goal.</p><p>Once you complete the level, you are scored on how big your katamari is and how well you followed instructions. It's basically a percentage though, since the max score is 100 points. You score dramatically drops if your Katamari isn't majority of that group. I think you need to score, at least, a certain amount of points to open up new levels.</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Controls</b></div><p>The placement of the sticks on the 360 controller really hurt the comfortability of Katamari. It doesn't feel terribly awkward, but it gets in my way every now and then. There's no balance of symmetry with the 360 controller like there was on the Playstation 2. This works great for 360 games where the right stick always controls movement, but not for Katamari. Katamari requires both sticks be used in unison and without balance, it can slow down your movements. Cross Chatter between hemispheres.</p><p>Also, the sticks are more rough than the Playstation 2 sticks. The ps2 sticks used a very small swivel radius which made the stick move very dramatically. On the 360, the radius is quite a bit larger, so when you move the stick up, it doesn't change its angle too much. This is probably more of a personal preference though, since I played the Playstation 2 titles to death.</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Level Design</b></div><p>I haven't quite put my finger on it yet, but I really suck at most of these levels. In most cases, when starting out, I can hardly pick up anything. I have to search around for little things to pick up, rather than having an equal abundance of all items. It always seems like I'm always one step behind of what the level designers want me to be picking up.</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Story</b></div><p>The story in Katamari was pretty simple. The King of all Cosmos broke all the stars and you must replace them in the night sky. So, as the prince, you roll around crap to rebuild stars in the sky.</p><p>We Love Katamari expanded on this by the King accidentally knocking out all the planets. So, you roll around crap to replace planets, meteors and other things in space. As you rolled along, though, you would find out more about the King, and yourself as well. The story was actually pretty fun, and told in hilarious Katamari style, with vocals and cutscenes.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari starts off with text, no vocals, about how the King, yet again, broken the universe, and you must roll up the planets again. Really? Could you not think of a better story or at least a different story? and then tell it in a worse more boring fashion? jesus..</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Price</b></div><p>Despite all its failings, the number one problem with this game is price. Katamari Damacy was release at $20. People bought the crap out of it, and loved it. It was the perfect price point. We Love Katamari annoyed people with it's $30 price tag when it came out a year and a half later, but it wasn't too bad. We Love Katamari offered much more than the original and was still a joy to play.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari is $40.. The same cost as a new Playstation 2 game. With the $30 We Love Katamari price, people took a step back and considered their purchase rather than just buying it as they did with the $20 Katamari Damacy. $40 is certainly cheaper than $60 or $50, but for Katamari? That is expensive.. especially those people new to series looking at the back of the box.</p><p>After playing it for 2 hours last night, the innovation doesn't even stack up its previous version. You can't charge more for a worse product, even if it is on a next-gen machine.</p><p>But wait there's more.. With the release of Beautiful Katamari, the Xbox live marketplace has 4 new downloadable levels already, for 200 points each. Already more levels to download, huh? So, what you're telling me, is that you shipped an unfinished game and now I have to pay an additional $10 for 4 more levels to complete it? That's bullshit.</p><p>So Beautiful Katamari is really $50 for the full game.. which is more than anyone should spend on a Playstation 2 game these days. $40 is almost too much for a Playstation 2 game unless it's fully featured and kick ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict?</b></div><p>This game is crap.. it's a more expensive inferior version of its Playstation 2 predecessors. I want more Katamari, but this game is annoying to play and not worth the price of admission. If you really want to play, definitely rent it and see for yourself.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PSP - Gurumin Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/psp-gurumin-impressions">PSP - Gurumin Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week saw the release of Beautiful Katamari..  a game series that I hold close to my heart, but not close enough that I would spend the $40 budget price tag of the next-generation to own it..  Not right now anyways..  I'd take advantage of that Toys R Us deal, but I can't find a third act to follow :/</p><p>Distraught and disappointed, I came home and decided to start playing some PSP games..  but I was looking for something a little more than just an hour of a puzzle rhythm game.  Out of my 20 PSP games, I'd say 14 are not very involved games.. so that narrowed the field down.</p><p>I had Valkyrie Profile, Metal Gear Solid, Generation of Chaos, Final Fantasy VII and one other story driven game that really caught my eye: Gurumin.  subtitle: a monsterous adventure.</p><div class='title'><b>Appeal</b></div><p>This was one of those games that looked like I would really like it just from looking at the cover.  It had a funny super-deformed character with several other colorful characters behind lighting up the canvas with intrigue.  I took a look at the back of the box, and it looked like some medievil adventure style game.  A very japanese non-mainstream title..</p><p>When gamestop marked Gurumin down to $20 back in May, I gladly picked it up.  Kinda sad when a game gets reduced in price 50% 3 months after release.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Gurumin is about a girl named Parin.  Parin had just moved to a quite mining town in the middle of no where populated only by adults.  Or so it seemed, after running around town she comes across a little child being harassed by a dog.  Parin leeps to her rescue and beats away the mean dog.</p><p>This child's named is Pico (i think) and she isn't actually a child..  She's a monster.  Her brother Puco quickly comes to the scene and tries to save Pico from you.  Both Puco and Pico are surprised that Parin can see them, as they are not visible to adults in the town.  Puco and Pico lead you to a hole in the town's wall where you are whisked away to the monster town.</p><p>The monster town is home to many playful and interesting monsters, but it's not too long until Puco is kidnapped by evil phantoms.  This is where the towns-monsters call on your for help.  In the center of the village is an ancient weapon that only a true hero could weild.  She/he who can pull it out of the ground, is its' rightful master.</p><p>Of course, it's no problem for you..  You pull out the weapon and huzzah!  The weapon is an ancient drill that has been known to slay the evil phantom menance in the past.</p><p>Anyways, You run out to save Puco, but it's all a diversion.  In your absense, the monster town is destroyed by the phantoms and evil mist covers the once beautiful monster land.</p><p>Even though, you've been playing for about 40 minutes, this is the point where the plot of the game really begins.  With the town in ruins, you travel back into the monster land and recover pieces of the shattered village and inspiration your monster friends to rebuild.</p><div class='title'><b>Looks</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of those playful kiddy adventure games that found a home on the Playstation back in the day.  Much like Megaman Legends, Tail Concerto and Brave Fencer Musashiden.  You play a cute little character, fighting monsters.. but all the enemies are very non-threatening and have brilliant colors and cute tones.  It's a Japanese kids game. ^_^</p><p>Also akin to those games, Gurumin is fully 3D with very simply textures and models..  It reminds me so much of a PS1 game because it looks just like a PS1 game, except the image quality on the PSP removes all those jagged edges and really smooths out everything.</p><p>I've been playing this on one of those new PSP Slim and Lites, and I've noticed a fair amount of ghosting with Parin's little red pigtail ribbons.  Whenever she moves quickly, her hair will jerk to the side and the ghosting is very apparent.  It doesn't really bother me though, and its only really noticable when she's on a dark background.</p><div class='title'><b>Role Playing Aspects</b></div><p>Anyways, Gurumin is an action RPG.  You have your weapons, your equipment and your HP.  You never really change weapons, but you can upgrade it.  Living in a mining town has its advantages..  just down the road you have your drill expert that can teach you new tricks with your drill...  He'll give 'em to you for free, but you'd much rather pay for them than owe favors.</p><p>Leveling is kinda funny in this game.  You have 3 power bars for your weapon and whenever you successful defeat an enemy, or break part of the environment, it'll start charging up your bar.  Once you power up a single bar, your weapon will gain a level and do more damage.  If you get hurt by an enemy, it'll decrease your power bar which can result in losing levels.</p><p>The only equipment I've found so far has been headgear.  Each piece of headgear has certain effects.  The store owner gives you goggles right off the bat, which help prevent water damage.  You can buy new pieces of equipment if you want, but you can also upgrade the equipment you own for increased effects.  These upgrades don't cost money, but do cost Junk.</p><p>Junk are broken pieces of weapons and armor you usually tear off of phantoms while you fight them.  Most phantom wear a funny hat, or carry a shield.  When you fight them, you'll eventually knock it off of them and you'll collect it.</p><p>So far, I haven't found a way to increase my max HP, but I'd guess they are items you can use to permanently increase your max health.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As an action RPG, you simple run around levels and beat the crap out of enemies.  The attacking system is really nice.  Sure, you can spam the attack button all you want, but you can buy new powerful moves to use against enemies too.  So far, I've purchase a spin attack and a ground smash attack.</p><p>There's actually a slight bit of strategy in using these attacks too.  When you're surounded by enemies, using the spin attack is actually more helpful than spamming the regular attack button, or jumping out of the way and attacking them one by one.  It's a useful attack.</p><p>You can also charge your attack, and coming drilling into battle rather than normal attacks.  Charging your drill is also very good for destroying chunks of the wall and pillars to find money and secret passage ways when in a dungeon.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallels</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of Drill Dozer, but they are completely different games.  Released on the Gameboy Advance, Drill Dozer preceeded Gurumin by 8 or 9 months and features similar concepts.</p><p>Parallel 1) You both play little girls using the power of a drill.  In Drill Dozer, Jill actually climbs into a drilling machine which kills enemies and destroys walls and pillars.  In Gurumin, Parin's drill is more of a spear.  The drill tip spear head is plunged into enemies.</p><p>Parallel 2) Both drills have a 3 part leveling system which is not permanent.  In Drill Dozer, you begin each stage at level 0.  Throughout the stage, you pick up gears which will allow you to charge your drill longer and present a greater attack.  In Gurumin, each successful kill increase your level all the way up to 3.  At each level, your drill is stronger, but you charge your attacks the same regardless of level.</p><p>I suppose Parallel 3) would be the charging of your shots are dependent on a 3 part leveling system where the higher the level the more powerful the charge shot.</p><p>But both games are of two different genres.  Gurumin is an action RPG, whereas Drill Dozer is a side-scroller.  I suppose both games are stage driven though and you unlock more stages as you continue into the game.  You can also visit previous stages you've beaten.</p><p>Drill Dozer is a fantastic game, by the way, and it'd definitely recommend it.  It's made by Game Freak after they finished Pokemon Emerald and before they began working on the next-generation of Pokemon games currenty out now.</p><div class='title'><b>Cute</b></div><p>Gurumin is a very lovable game.  You play a funny cute girl who is very rude to the elderly townspeople.  She also pokes fun at the cookie-cutter story too..  The game has some clever item descriptions too, like those Disgaea and Phantom Brave.</p><p>It's really been a joy to play so far, but a little on the easy side.  It's still the beginning though, so there's plenty of time to be challenging.</p><p>After 2 hours of the game, my verdict is quite positiive.  If you like offbeat action rpgs, I'd say definitely go for it.  Gamestop probably has it for slightly cheaper than $20 these days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/capcoms-gamer-day-announcements">Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, Capcom has their Gamer's Day out in London, England and with it several interesting announcements had occurred.  One of the biggest announcements was Street Fighter 4.. but that's not really what interested me so much.  Actually, the trailer for Streeet Fighter 4 looks pretty slick.. <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml">check it out.</a> They also officially announced Apollo Justice, which I'm estactic for, but there's some else that could be interesting.</p><p>Good 'ol <b>Lost Planet</b> we see its release on the Playstation 3.  This is fantastic news.  The Playstation 3 release will include all downloadable content seen on Xbox Live and the PC version of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Why is this fantastic news?</b></div><p>Well, to be honest Lost Planet is a piece of shit.  The gameplay is restrictive and gets in the way and the final boss is unbeatable even when you knock his life to 0..  <a href="/old/v7/lost-planet" title="/lost-planet">read all about it</a></p><p>Lost Planet coming to Playstation 3 is a gateway.  It means that Capcom is developing a Playstation 3 port of their Lost Planet engine, which was initially developed when making Dead Rising..  This engine was made with love from Keiji Inafune's team in the hopes of one day creating a next-gen Megaman adventure game to the tune of Megaman Legends 3.  That's why there's all those Megaman references in Dead Rising and Lost Planet.</p><p>Making a multi-platform version of their Lost Planet / Dead Rising engine should give them more leverage in pitching the idea of Megaman Legends 3 to the Capcom powers that be.  This also means there's a slight hope for a Playstation 3 Dead Rising port..  or at least Dead Rising 2 on both platforms... or whatever they have next on the engine hitting both platforms.</p><div class='title'><b>others</b></div><p>Capcom also announced a new Sci-fi IP titled Dark Void.. so I wonder if that's the next game for this engine.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sneak King Final Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sneak-king-final-thoughts">Sneak King Final Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On second hand though, Sneak King is so monotonous that it gets tiring really fast. I liked playing the first level in the saw mill because it was relatively easy, but the later levels have more challenge and the limitations of the gameplay get in your way of completing your missions</p><div class='title'><b>Short-comings</b></div><p>After playing the same level of Sneak King over and over, you'll begin to notice that all the people in the level aren't randomly generated. Everyone is on a specific track starting in a specific spot whenever you load a mission. Irregardless of where you are in the level, everyone else will begin in the same spot, and usually they'll be hungry at the exact same times.</p><p>Even though this is incredibly lazy programming, it makes the game predictable. You know exact where you have to be at a specific time, and if you screw it up, then do it again. You don't need to take into account random events as you would in real life. This really brings the feeling of the game into a game-like atmosphere and you can improve on your score because of this.</p><p>This is fine for the first level, where people are predictably hungry when they near hiding places, but the second level flips the paradigm upside down. Hardly anyone in this level travels near a hiding place, and when they do, they're either not hungry or start too close to the hiding place for you to hide without them seeing you.</p><p>They cover for this by making nearly all missions in the second level Stealth based, rather than Surprise based. But those few that are hiding are nearly impossible to get an A ranking on. I'm not even sure if it's possible to do so. :/</p><p>I just made it to the third level last night, and there's a night and day difference between that and the previous level. You have a much more open space like at the saw mill, but you have a ton of people that are rarely hungry. Getting around is tough.</p><div class='title'><b>Not enough variety</b></div><p>Like I mentioned in the previous post, nearly all missions are the exact same. You've got a certain number of BK items to give out to people, and you either do it as fast as possible, or with the highest score possible. Sometimes they'll give you restrictions like only give to females, or don't perform a flourish.. Annoying things that prevent you from enjoying the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnt out</b></div><p>After playing this game nearly all Sunday, and then another hour on Monday, I don't think i'll be able to play this game again. 7 hours is all the enjoyment I've gotten out of it, and the only thing that really keeps me going is unlocking more achievements. I'm pretty close to unlocking a few more. I've completed around 37 out of 80 missions in the game. I don't think anyone has played this game that far. Gage said he played it for about 10 minutes and got bored.</p><div class='title'><b>Rate this game</b></div><p>So how do you really rate this game? It's horrible programmed.. you can't invert neither axis, and the camera angles screw you on occasions.. but.. it's only $4. You get what you pay for. $4 is cheaper than nearly all Xbox Live games... and it really shows.</p><p>It's because of that $4 price tag that I definitely recommend the game, but you probably won't get much play out of it. You'll find the same things hilarious like I did, but then get absolutely bored with nothing else to do in the game.</p><p>(and) This is supposed to be the better of the 3 Burger King games.. I wonder if the other ones are actually that bad. It difficult to screw up a racing game, but bumper cars? That sounds pretty boring..</p><div class='title'><b>Why does this work?</b></div><p>Something else that kinda puzzles me is "Why does this game work?". Why is the King such a successful mascot that they can make a crappy cheap game on the 360 and have it rise to one of the best selling 360 games of last Christmas season? Let's face facts.. you're only playing this game because of The King.</p><p>Burger King will never reach sales equal to McDonalds, but their marketing plans are great. 2006 was one of their busiest years for marketing. They had 4 marketing campaigns going on at the same too, which was somewhat confusing. They Cock Rock pushing those Chicken Fries, The King doing his normal thing, those Office workers pushing the dollar menu, and that one MAN commercial pushing the steak sandwich... They were pulling out all the stops.</p><p>These days, I haven't really seen any burger king commercials. I occasionally see a crappy McDonalds commercial, and those disgusting Hardees commercials have also made waves on my TV.. I wonder what BK is up to.. Perhaps they're biding their time until the Superbowl again.</p><p>Anyways, The King hits the mark at the perfect amount of goofy and bizarre that drives sales in the 18 to 35 demographic, i guess. Superimposing him into football plays only drives the point home further.</p><div class='title'><b>Hope</b></div><p>Hopefully Burger King will do some more Xbox related games or downloads in the future. I think if they went back and refined Sneak King, it could be a great game... but 80 missions of exactly the same thing is overkill.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 - Sneak King " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-sneak-king">Xbox 360 - Sneak King </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today was one of those rare days where I didn't really have anything to occupy my time.  Usually my Sundays are spent coming back to Madison from wherever I stayed the night before, but today I got back home around 1pm and had the whole day in front of me.  I finally finished up Halo 3, but that only took an hour or two.</p><p>I didn't want to start an involved game since Castlevania comes out in a week..  I was thinking about playing some more Oblivion, but it felt like a waste of time..  But then on the shelf behind me, I saw my vice.  A brilliant gem on the 360 that I was so excited for last year.  I had missed my chance to play it because I was living over seas, but my little brother picked me up a copy..</p><p>Sneak King..  One of three Burger King games released for the Xbox and Xbox 360 last christmas season.  In fact, It was one of the top sellers for the Xbox 360, since it was yours for the low low price of $3.99 with purchase of value meal.  How could you honestly beat that?  That's cheaper than buying a magazine about the 360.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day with my pal, the King and it was great!</p><div class='title'><b>The premise</b></div><p>Sneak King is probably the most market driven of the 3 Xbox Burger King games.  In Sneak King, you play as the king, and must deliver delicious Burger King food items to the hunger people of various environments.  You are judged on 5 things that will multiply your score:  Sneak/Surpise, Hunger, Flourish, Range, Chain.</p><p><em>Sneak/Surpise</em><br/>This is the initial point total of your presentation.  You can simply sneak behind the citizen, but you'll find yourself 5 times the amount of points if you surprise them!  To surprise them, you hide in part of the environment and when they walk by..  you jump out in front of them with a tasty BK treat!</p><p><em>Hunger</em><br/>Of course, you can't give anyone food..  they have to want it.  The king has special mind reading powers that allows him to see how hungry someone is.  When they are at their hungriest.. that is the best time to strike!</p><p><em>Flourish</em><br/>Giving food to someone unsuspecting is great, but you really need to let them have it.  When you pounce on someone you're given a guage much like in a golf game.  Get that thing to full and you'll present the food to them in such a way, they'll be absolutely dazzled.</p><p><em>Range</em><br/>The closer you are to your target, the bigger the surpise!</p><p><em>Chain</em><br/>This is really how you build up your points..  Whenever the King is spotted it throws off his game and he must start again.  The chain is how many chained sneaks you can perform without getting caught.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>Using the gameplay described above, you are presented with several missions in each area.  Missions are generally all the same except with different time restraints, score restraints, and sneak restraints.  All in all, you have 4 different environments with 20 missions included in each.  That's a lot of missions.  It probably took me about 4 or 5 hours to full complete the first area before heading onto the next.</p><p>That first area was sort of split up into 3 sections though, so it wasn't too monotenous, but you're still doing the same thing over and over again.  The different environments provide a change of pace, though.</p><p>The first environment is the saw mill.  You have hungry lumberjacks and workers looking for a quite BK break in the middle of their daunting day.  The second environment is the cul de sack.  The dead end of a suburban street where neighbors are walking around greeting each other and looking for a quite BK break of their daily lives.</p><p>The first environment provided you will ample room and plenty of places to hide and pounce on the hungry inhabitants..  The second environment is much more dense..  They focus on sneaking, rather than surprising.  Even though, you should always hide yourself from the public, they really emphasis that in the second chapter.</p><div class='title'><b>Progress</b></div><p>I just reached halfway through the second world, so I've still got a ways to go if I wish to achievement whore the game.  Sneak King is hilarious and full of flaws..  Quite possibly one of the best B-games on the 360 to date, next to Earth Defense Force..  Definitely check it out if you can find a copy.  It's a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/2007-10/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
