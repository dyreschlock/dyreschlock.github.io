I kinda figured it would work a lot like Steam achievements.</p><p>With Steam, every achievement is valued the same.  For each game you have a percentage complete and that's how you compare achievements with your pals.  There is a lack of quality though, as this is really only a comparison of how much you've played the game versus your friends.</p><p>With Xbox Live Achievements, every single achievement has a specific value.  Even though Microsoft regulates that each game cannot exceed 1000 points (except through DLC), it's up to the developer to distribute those points in the game.  They can choose how many achievements and the value of each one.  Percentage Complete does not matter.</p><p>In a way, that's kinda neat.  For example: Of the 1000 points, you could have 2 really difficult achievements worth 300 each, and 5 dirt-ass easy achievements for 80 each.  One gamer could've gotten the 2 tough achievements for a gamer score of 600, while another gamer could've gotten those easy ones for a total of 400.  In this case, you can clearly tell who the "better" gamer is because of the score.  The Percentage complete wouldn't reflect this at all..</p><p>Though, the "better" gamer could easily scoop up those other 5 achievements, the criteria for those achievements could be something unrealistic for the "better" gamer to achieve.  Like "Complete the game on Easy" or whatever..  The "better" gamer probably has better thing to do with their time..  Especially when playing another game gets just as many points as this one.</p><p>Xbox focuses on the quality of achievements you receive rather than quantity, but, in many ways, quantity is its own form of quality as playing many many many games will get you a rather high gamer score.</p><p>The Playstation's Trophy System takes an alternative route to both implemenations, but still borrows ideas from each..  In game, you have 3 different weighted trophies to obtain: Gold, Silver and Bronze.  Silver carries more weight than Bronze, and so forth..  There's also a Platinum trophy for each game which is awarded when you complete 100% of the achievements in a game.</p><p>Each game has a specific amount of trophies they can distribute, but they didn't really say how they are distributed..  Does that mean each game has 6 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze?  or does it work like the Xbox and you can have any amount of trophies you want as long as they add up to a specified amount?  :shrugs:...  Either way, all these trophies do add up.  Each one gives you a little bit of "experience" which will gain you "Gamer Levels", which is the global way of comparing yourself to others.</p><p>This whole system seems like a refinement of the achievement system that pulls together both quantity and quality.  I'm a big fan of those Platinum Trophies because the system actually rewards you for playing through the entire game and doing everything.  Although, there are games on Steam and Xbox that give you rewards in game for 100% completion, neither service does on a global level.</p><p>The big problem I see with the Playstation Trophies is support.  At launch of the 2.40 firmware update, only 9 games will support Trophies, all of which are first party.  The free game that came with the Metal Gear Solid 4 Playstation 3 Bundle is on that list (PAIN), but there's no announcement of Metal Gear Solid 4 Trophies, which is what I want.  Also no Trophies for Flow, Echochrome, or Everyday Shooter :/  Trophy Support can be patched into any game, though.. so hopefully these developers will work on that.</p><p>Anywho, this information comes from the Playstation blog where Eric Lempel gives a video demostration of the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/29/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-1-the-xmb/" title="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/29/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-1-the-xmb/">In-Game XMB</a> and the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/30/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-2-trophies/" title="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/30/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-2-trophies/">Trophy System</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Infected Mushroom, Jimmie Page @ Visions, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago">Infected Mushroom, Jimmie Page @ Visions, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 22, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, Tony, Erika and I made a little trip down to Chicago.  Earlier in the week when getting caught up on "the scene" in Minneapolis, I broadened my search to see what was coming up in Chicago and noticed that Infected Mushroom was down there this weekend.  The one thing I had planned this weekend was canceled, so I thought, "why the hell not?"  I figured that Tony and Erika would want to come with so I invited them along ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Chinatown</b></div><p>One place I've heard about in Chicago is Chinatown.  Erika always mentions Chinatown when the subject of Chicago crops up in conversation.  So we figured that would be an ideal location to visit.  First, we got something to eat since we really hadn't had anything all day and then we took a look around at the area and the shops.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1027.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1030.webp" /></p><p>Chinatown was spread out much more than I thought It was going to be.  I was thinking it would've been cramped together like the one in Nagasaki, or the type of thing you'd see in a Hong Kong action movie.  Thing alley-ways with tons of shops.  There were tons of shops, but it felt like an actual town, rather than a closet.  I guess that's just the American environment at work...  When they first laid the groundwork for Chinatown, they had the room to spread out.  They were confined to a single square block.</p><p>They have some sort of festival coming up on Sunday July 20th sponsored by McDonalds that looks like it'd be fun.  Unfortunately, I'll be in Minneapolis that weekend for my High School Reunion, so that's out.  Maybe next year.</p><p>It'd definitely be neat to check out the other international areas of Chicago in the future.  Erika mentioned a Greek Town and Korea Town..  maybe there's a little Italy in there somewhere.  The one is probably full of mobsters, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Downtown</b></div><p>Afterwards, we hopped back on the trains and went downtown and killed a couple hours walking around and looking for stores that no longer exist.  We came across the still under construction Trump tower that you might know from the first season of the Apprentice.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1041.webp" /></p><p>They still have a ways to go before they claim the title of tallest building in Chicago, though.  We hung out around the river for quite a while as day turned to dusk turned to night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1060.webp" /></p><p>We hung out at the two-story museum-like McDonalds for another hour until the doors finally opened up at Visions.</p><div class='title'><b>Visions</b></div><p>It had been a while since the last time I was at Visions.  Actually, I'm not even totally sure when the last time was...  Lemme see..  ah, it was Sasha in 2004.  Luckily, I have all this crap <a href="/old/v7/club" title="/club">written down</a>, back when I really cared about it ^_^  2004 was aksi when I started going to fewer clubs...</p><p>Anyways, there was actually a decent line forming in the front of Visions.  People were pretty excited for Infected Mushroom ^_^  It wasn't too long before we got in, but they kept everyone waiting in that extra club that you usually go right through into Visions.  Nope, they had the door shut and a guy posted at the entrance to keep people from actually getting into Visions.  So all of us the fanboy crowd sat in there while we could clearly see others in Visions...</p><p>Oh well, at 11pm the dude opened up the doors and we all piled into Visions.</p><div class='title'><b>Jimmie Page</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1076.webp" /></p><p>Jimmie Page greeted us into Visions with some fantastic tracks and kept them coming all night long.  The pounding beats built into a mass hysteria of funk and house.  I think I bought a CD of his a couple years ago and it sounded nothing like this.  Honestly, I need to hold reservations on people until I hear them live.  I think that's the true test of quality and ambiance.  Can the performer really resonate with the crowd and build up the set keeping the audience in suspense while still giving them exactly what the want?</p><p>Jimmie Page proved he was that man, and he really blew me away.  I got a demo CD from him too, so I can't wait to listen to that later on. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1104.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1125.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1150.webp" /></p><p>Though, the crowd began to slip away from Jimmie with the anticipation of Infected Mushroom and their vacant equipment sitting on the stage opposite of the DJ booth.  Thankfully the fans weren't too rude by chanting "Infected Mushroom" or anything, but they were definitely there for the Mushroom.</p><div class='title'><b>Infected Mushroom</b></div><p>After a 2 1/2 hour set, Jimmie relinquished aural command and all eyes set themselves on the stage where Infected Mushroom was set to go.  The fans went nuts. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1207.webp" /><br/>I've heard of Infected Mushroom, but never actually heard them previous to this night.  The name made me immediately think of PsyTrance on the order of Hallucinogen and such groups, but I was dead wrong with that classification.  I'm not really sure what sub-sub-genre of Electronica they'd fall into, but they'd definitely be right next to Prodigy on the shelf.  Tony was thinking Hardcore, or, at least, somewhere in that area, which sounds about right.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1214.webp" /></p><p>Infected Mushroom were fucking incredible, though..  I think they're my new favorite band, ^_^.  For over an hour and a half they keep playing song after song after song and didn't quit.  Bam Bam Bam Bam, like the thunderous body-pounding bass surging into your chest with every beat.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1218.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1241.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1264.webp" /></p><p>I don't think I've ever seen a crowd this energetic for anyone.  Most of the DJs or bands I see are mostly low key or if they have a pounding beat are still strung together with a melodic ambiance that is still calming.  Infected Mushroom is constant barrage.  Bam Bam Bam Bam, punching you in the face, in the shoulder.. pushing you around.  Their music has this surge of adrenaline that keeps you moving fist pumping in the air and yelling as loud as you can.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1273.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080622_chicago/IMG_1294.webp" /></p><p>The night was quite amazing and I'm glad I asked Tony and Erika to come alone with. ^_^  This is the type of thing where'd I usually run off alone and not ask anyone to join me, but I figured they'd be interested in checking it out, at the very least.</p><p>More Pictures can be found here: <a href="/old/v7/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago" title="/infected-mushroom-jimmie-page-visions-chicago">http://www.theschlock.com/photo/080622_chicago/</a></p><div class='title'><b>The drive home</b></div><p>Bar curfews very from city to city.  Minneapolis has a curfew that all bars and clubs must close by 3am on a Saturday night.  I think, Madison is 2am..  But Chicago can go all the way to 5am.  Fortunately, Infected Mushroom finished off their encore around 3am, so we didn't stay all that late in the windy city.  I think we got out of downtown and back on the highways around 3:45am or 4am.</p><p>That drive home is always difficult for me because I've just come from this immense loud ear-damaging party, and now must drive for quite a while until I'm finally able to sleep.  I've never made it all the way before..  Usually, I find some motel and sleep in the parking lot for a few hours to muster the energy to finish the trip later or stop off at one of those Oasis McDonalds and buy enough food to keep me busy.  I almost made it to Rockford this time ^_^.  Erika offered to drive the rest of the way to Freeport and Tony drove the rest of the way back to Madison.  We got to watch the sunrise as we trotted along the highways.</p><p>Anywho, today I'm so completely sore.  I feel like I was thoroughly beaten up.  It was really more of love beating, though.  It'll be tough to top last night with the several events that are coming up in the next few months, but they're spread out enough that shouldn't ruin them.  Hopefully I can find something decent in Tampa for the July 4th weekend....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's heavy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-heavy">It's heavy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning I woke up around 4:30 in the morning.  It was the first time I had ever woken up to my alarm and not gone back to bed immediately.  It wasn't too difficult since I went to bed around 9:45 the night before.  I got out of my bed closet and went into the bathroom, dragging some clothes with.  I took a shower and washed the night away to make a clean break for the day ahead.</p><p>I left my new apartment around 5 o'clock, while it was still fairly dark out.  It's been a while since I've seen a sunrise, but with the cloud cover vast and dark, it would still be a while longer.  I got into the car that I'm borrowing and went to my local Wal*mart.</p><p>Wal*mart didn't open until 6, but since they were only getting 6 Metal Gear Solid 4 Playstation 3 Bundles, I figured that I would have to wait outside before anyone else arrived in order to procure one.  I had this planned out all week for today's release.</p><p>On my drive, I nervously thought to myself if another 6 people were already waiting at the door, perched to snatch the few precious copies.  I had the rest of the morning planned out if such an event occurred for the other 24 hour Wal*mart said that if their night crew hadn't put their copies out throughout the night, the morning crew, which started at 7, would surely do so.  I had my suspicions, though. If not, there was still Shopko at 8, Best Buy at 9, and Toys R Us at 10.<br/>I turned onto Gammon and as I neared the beltline, Wal*mart was in clear view from across the highway.  All the street lamps illuminated the area like a massive spotlight in the grim dark of morning.  It went out of view when I continued underneath the bridge.  The tree line hide the shopping center on the other side.</p><p>I turned the corner and then turned into parking lot which joined both Wal*mart and Sam's Club.  Several cars were grazing in the parking lot.  Most of them keeping to themselves, but there were a few grouped together near the entrance.  I couldn't make out any figures from my current distance, but as I neared, there were definitely a couple people outside.  The group finally came into focus and a mere 4 figures emerged.  Yes!  Call me Number 5.</p><p>I park my car, went outside and approached the line just as the clock hit 5:15.  In the line stood 2 couples, so I was actually Number 3.  We talked about Metal Gear, and other games to purchase.  As the minutes trickled by, another person joined us and the conversation.  Then another..  and eventually another.</p><p>Number 6 joined the line around 5:45, so I could've waited a little longer before getting to Wal*mart, but I'm fine with my position in line.  3 other groups of people were too late.</p><p>At 6 o'clock the doors opened and inside we went.  Unfortunately, the staff were confused as to why we were there, and even more confused when trying to ring us up at the register.  This whole free $100 gift card w/ purchase of Blu-ray player this week wasn't trained to the entire staff.  It took the 6 of us a couple minutes to go through the check-out lines, but by 6:30 I was out of Wal*mart with both Giftcard and PS3 in hand.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" /></p><p>huzzah!</p><p>After you purchase a Playstation 3 and lift the box, I think everyone's puzzled expression is the same, "It's heavy".  The thing weighs 16 lbs according to my bathroom scale.  It's a heavy-duty piece of equipment.</p><p>Anywho, now it's about 7 o'clock and it's almost time to go to work..... LONGEST WORK DAY EVER! At least, now when I go to Wal*mart for lunch I won't need to pay for the next month or two.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Furniture Store employees are stalkers" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/furniture-store-employees-are-a-bunch-of-stalkers">Furniture Store employees are stalkers</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 2, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past week, I bought two new pieces of a furniture while shopping around for some household supplies. First, I bought a very nice end table from American TV in their clearance section. It matches my desk quite nicely and can house food and drinks, which previously took up real estate on my desk. A couple days later, I went to East-side Slumberland and bought a decent coffee table for super cheap from their clearance section. I thought it would look great on the other side of the my desk than my end table and could house my record player, which previously sat atop my foot locker.</p><p>My home work space is starting to feel quite spacious. ^_^</p><p>I haven't been living in my new place for long, and have really only given my new address to Netflix, and the post office; however, over the weekend, I got a very peculiar piece of mail at my new address. I got a small manilla-like colored envelope from Mr. Rob Leibfried whom has very bad handwriting. It was personally addressed to myself, living at my new address. "What in the hell is this?!" I inquired to those within earshot. I was somewhat creeped out..</p><p>Those feelings began to elevate as I opened the letter to find a "Thank You" card. Inside the Thank You note said, with horrible handwriting, "Thank you for your recent purchase, rob". I began to cycle through my memory the things I had purchased with this address in mind. The only place was Slumberland, since I didn't give my new address to American.</p><p>You'd think a little context would have been helpful since the guy I bought it from was completely rude. Kyle and I discussed this a little bit, and came to the conclusion that maybe the dude felt bad about it, or something like that. I still think it's incredibly bizarre.. I spent a whopping $40 on that coffee table, and its not even all that sturdy. Even though it was crazy cheap, I still feel like I was doing them the favor... hey, I guess that's why they thanked me, huh.</p><p>Anyways, today I'm at work and my phone rings with an unidentified number. I do what I usually do: Not answer, and type the number into google to identify it for myself. By the way, if I don't have your phone number in my phone and you give me a ring, please leave a message. Otherwise, I'll probably just ignore it, if I can't figure it out through google.</p><p>This particular phone number is 608-271-1000, which is the number to American TV. "What the hell do they want? I picked up my end-table when I bought it.. I didn't sign up for anything else, despite spending 30 minutes looking at TVs," I immediately thought. Luckily, I was left a message. "Hi there Jim, this is <blank> from American TV just asking if you're enjoying your recent purchase. Let me know if you need help with anything and I look forward to seeing you soon." Jesus Christ, needy much? If I had answered, what would we even talk about? It'd be the most awkward phone call I'd ever had been a part of. Also, "see you soon"?! How soon are we talking here? Like "you're going to break into my house and stab me with a knife" soon?</p><p>It is a really good End-table though. One of the most sturdy pieces of furniture I own, next to my file cabinet. I was actually rather lucky to find it at such a spiffy price.</p><p>But anyways, do all furniture stores train their employees this way? Ikea never called me about my desk and JC Penny never called about my file cabinet. This is borderline invasion of privacy. I assumed my address was used for billing purposes, not another entry into their Rolodex. This makes me think twice about buying a TV from American or clearance couch shopping at Slumberland.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
