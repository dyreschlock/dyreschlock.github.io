| March 27, 2020 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There are two major goals of Pokemon as the original theme song of the anime states: (1) <I>To catch them is my real test</I> and (2) <I>To train them is my cause</I>. For many people, battling (number 2) is their most favorite thing about pokemon. They build up their best pokemon, and battle online or battle their friends. Catching every Pokemon in the game (number 1) has always been my real goal.</p><p>In Pokemon games, the Pokedex (perhaps short for Pokemon Rolodex or Pokemon Index) is a complete list of all Pokemon available in the game. Whenever you caught a specie of Pokemon, it is registered in your Pokedex as being caught. When the Pokedex is complete, you have essentially caught every Pokemon in the game. Once complete, you will receive a diploma detailing your accomplishment. :)</p><p>To catch Pokemon, you usually just find them out in the wild. Over time with more and more Pokemon added to the mythos, it no longer became feasible to have every single Pokemon available in the wild. As such, the Pokédexes were split between Regional dexes and the National dex. The National Pokedex is a complete list of all Pokemon, and the Regional Pokedex is the list of all Pokemon available in that particular game.</p><p>If certain Pokemon weren't available in the game, then you would have to either migrate Pokemon from a previous game or trade from another game in the same generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Completing the National Pokedex for the first time</b></div><p>Back in <a href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete" title="/pokedex-nearly-complete">December 2014</a>, I wrote about how I was close to completing my life-long goal of collecting every single Pokemon. In Pokemon White, my National Dex was at 647 out of 649, and for Pokemon X/Y and ORAS, I was at 717 and 716 out of 720.</p><p>A few months later, I was able to catch the few remaining Pokemon I needed.</p><p>In Pokemon White, I bought a used copy of Pokemon Black 2. That save file already completed the game and has a Meloetta and Latios on there. I transferred them over, and was able to get my Diploma for completing the dex. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen5_white_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Pokemon White</b> and Generation 5 was complete.</p><p>I migrated both Pokemon forward to Pokemon X/Y, which were both missing in my games. Additionally, I bought a used copy of Pokemon Y which also had a completed save, and had the remaining Pokemon I was missing.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_x.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_x.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_x_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_x_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_x_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_omegaruby.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_omegaruby.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_omegaruby_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_omegaruby_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/1502_gen6_omegaruby_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Generation 6 was now complete with diplomas from both <b>Pokemon X</b> and <b>Pokemon Omega Ruby</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>National Pokedex is Dead</b></div><p>Generation 7 released in November 2016 with Pokemon Sun and Moon.  Most recently, Generation 8 has begun with the release of Pokemon Sword and Shield in Nov 2019.  As of today, there are 890 total Pokemon across all games. </p><p>Unfortunately, the National Pokedex is being phased out due to the unsustainable amount of Pokemon.  Previously, Pokemon Sun and Moon were the first games to no longer include the National Pokedex. And now, Pokemon Sword and Shield are the first to actually no even allow many Pokemon from previous generations. In both games, you could only complete the Regional dex.</p><p>Not including the National Pokedex in both games completely killed off my enjoyment of those games. I really just sped through them, beat 'em, and moved on. I did not linger nearly as long as I did with Pokemon X/Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (ORAS).</p><div class='title'><b>The Modern National Pokedex</b></div><p>Pokemon Sword and Shield were released missing A LOT of features available in previous generations. Besides the National Dex, the most notable missing feature was the GTS, Global Trade System, which allowed players to easily trade which Pokemon they wanted.</p><p>Last month, they feature were released in <b>Pokemon Home</b>. This is an online database where you can store all of your Pokemon. It can be accessed from your Nintendo Switch and from your Phone. On your Phone, you're able to access the GTS, where you can trade any Pokemon you have in your Home account. You can organize all of your Pokemon, too. There are also many collection and trade challenges that will give you achievements and stickers when you complete them.</p><p>But, within Pokemon Home, the National Pokedex had returned.</p><p>From previous generations on the Nintendo 3DS, you could migrate your Pokemon forward using Pokemon Bank, a similar service on the 3DS. And with currently released Pokemon games on the Switch, you could grab Pokemon from them.</p><p>On the Nintendo 3DS, I began moving Pokemon from Pokemon X and Omega Ruby into Pokemon Bank, and then into Pokemon Sun and Moon and also Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. I didn't take too long to collect the remaining Pokemon I was missing from both games to complete the <b>Alola Regional Dex</b> in both games.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_moon_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2003_gen7_ultrasun_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>All of my Pokemon from all of my previous games were moved into Pokemon Bank, and then migrated to Pokemon Home. Then, they were temporary moved into Pokemon Sword. I had not ever finished Pokemon Sword at this point, but it was really easy to fly through the rest of the game with Pokemon from my previous games.</p><p>Collecting the remaining Pokemon was really easy, and with the accessibility of the GTS in Pokemon Home, grabbing the version exclusives and other missing Pokemon took no time at all.

I had played through these games a year or two before, but I had not bothered trying to complete the Pokedex.

It did not take long to transfer over the previous Pokemon and catch new ones.</p><p>In August 2020, I was able to complete the <b>Isle of Armor Regional Pokedex</b>, and in October 2020, I could complete the <b>Crown Tundra Regional Pokedex</b>.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2008_gen8_armor_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_diplomas/2010_gen8_tundra_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b></div><p><I>Update! February 2022</I></p><p>Pokemon Legends is a reimagining of the Sinnoh region (generation 4) as your character is thrown into the past when Pokemon were first being discovered and Pokemon technology was being invented. Pokeballs had just been invented, and you join a clan whose purpose it is to discover and catalog ever Pokemon species in the region.</p><p>This game felt tailor-made for me. Finally there was a Pokemon game whose sole purpose was the complete the Pokedex. Also, the gameplay was incredibly fresh for the franchise. You no longer had to battle Pokemon to catch them. You could simply sneak up behind them and throw a ball. You could dodge attacks, and move around. When you did battle Pokemon, battles happened right where you were. There was no separate battle screen. Everything in the game was open. I played this game day in and day out after its release.

| November 29, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I went to the Pokemon Center in Nagoya to grab that Shiny Tyranitar they are currently giving away.  Though, unlike previous mystery gifts, you had to receive it via connection to the Internet, rather than local wireless..  which is somewhat curious.</p><div class='title'><b>Mystery Gifts</b></div><p>First off, there are 3 ways you can receive mystery gifts in the recent Pokemon games:  Internet, local wireless, and serial codes.</p><p>Serial Codes are new with the Gen VI games.  You input a 16-digital code.  The game verifies the code online.  And then it'll give you the gift.  There are two kinds of codes, too: unique and non-unique.  Unique codes are strictly one-time use.  Once the code is used, it can no longer be used by anyone.  Non-unique codes can be used once per game.  If code hasn't expired, anyone is able to receive that gift.</p><p>One nice thing about unique codes is that you can receive repeat events as long as you have multiple codes for that event.</p><p>Connecting to the Internet for gifts has been around since Gen IV.  If Nintendo is currently holding an event, just connect online, and receive the gift!  Simple.  Though, one thing to note is that is tied to whatever region your game is from.  US games can only download US events, and so on.</p><p>Gifts distribute via local wireless connections have been already since Gen III on the GBA.  Though at that time, you needed to own the wireless adapter.  To receive these gifts, you must be within proximity of the wireless network in order to make a connection, and download the gift.</p><p>Prior to that, there were other shenanigans required to receive gifts, but the always revolved on your showing up to the event in person.  The local wireless gifts are the modern evolution of that.</p><div class='title'><b>Gen VI Local Wireless Events</b></div><p>Japan has a shit-load of local events throughout the year where you can receive plenty of unique gifts that almost never come to the states.  As mentioned above, the current event is a Shiny Tyranitar.</p><p>Every local event in Japan has been region free for me.  I've been able to receive the event pokemon on both my Japanese games and US games.  Receiving these events have had an interesting effect, too.  Whichever region these Pokemon were received in, becomes the region of that Pokemon.  Even though these events are Japanese, receiving it on my English game creates an English Pokemon, rather than a Japanese one.</p><p>Though, for some reason, this method changed with this Shiny Tryanitar</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo Zone</b></div><p>At the Pokemon Center, rather than collecting the Tyranitar over local wireless, you had to connect through the Internet to receive it.  Specifically, your 3DS had to connect to the Nintendo Zone Wi-Fi network, and download the mystery gift through the Internet.  As I mentioned before, it's a curious change.</p><p>Through wireless, the only authentication done has been on the client-side, or on the 3DS itself.  The wireless signal simply broadcasts when the box is turned on, and does nothing else.  The 3DS searches for any signals.  When it finds one, it does a quick compatibility check, and then either accepts or denies it.</p><p>This new route has a lot more handshaking.  First, on the system level of the 3DS, it must connect to the Internet through the Nintendo Zone.  If the wireless mode is turned on, the 3DS does this automatically.  When connecting through the Internet, the 3DS will send a bunch of information about your game and 3DS through the Internet to Nintendo.  On the server-side, Nintendo will do all the authentication.  Then, Nintendo will decide whether or not to allow you to have the mystery gift.</p><p>One thing that Nintendo authenticates on the server-side is region.  I was not able to download the Tyranitar on the English version of game.  Only the Japanese version worked.  So, I was only able to get one mystery gift, instead of two.</p><p>Yeah, yeah..  boo-hoo, and all that.  But, it's a very interesting change.</p><div class='title'><b>Why?</b></div><p>Because of the region blocking, this allows the event Pokemon to retain their intended region.  The Tyranitar I downloaded from a Japanese event can only be a Japanese Pokemon now.  But, I think that's really just an unintended side effect.</p><p>Because of all the authentication done on the server-side and system level, this allows for a lot more security, which prevents any problems caused by piracy.  If you had some way of receiving the signal outside of the 3DS, now, there's no way you could download a million copies of the event Pokemon.</p><p>Additionally, this gives more control to Nintendo for distributing events.  Back at HQ, they only need to flip one switch on and off, rather than each distribution center having that power.  Everything can be handled at a central location.  Also, distribution centers need not worry about handling any extra hardware on their end.  Only the Nintendo Zone, which is really just a router.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it seems that Nintendo of America recently did this for their Hoopa distribution.  To receive that Pokemon, you had to connect through Nintendo Zone at McDonalds.</p><p><u>Update (3/18)</u>: There's an event going on right now for a Shiny Ho-oh at Pokemon Centers.  But for this event, it goes through Wireless, rather than Internet.  I figured that would continue with the Internet going forward, but I guess they went back to wireless.  Weird.. why?</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to March Japanese Event Pokemon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/march-japanese-event-pokemon">March Japanese Event Pokemon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The remaining two are Arceus holding a Silk Scarf.  One of those two are shiny.

| December 21, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After taking a break for a few weeks, I completed Pokemon Omega Ruby today.  There's still the Delta Episode to complete, plus several legendaries to scoop up, though.</p><p>Omega Ruby is pretty damn good.  They've cleaned up a lot of rough edges from Pokemon X, and there's a ton of end game, and side content.  WAY more than Pokemon X/Y.  I think the only shame is not continuing the character customization from Pokemon X, but that's fine.</p><p>Right now, my Pokedex for Pokemon X is at 718*, and Omega Ruby is at 716 out of a (current) possible 719.  I need an Aromatisse, and Yveltal for Omega Ruby, and a Meloetta for both games.  I'm so close to completing the Pokedex, a challenge that I began 10 years ago with Pokemon Emerald.  It's somewhat fitting that I'm so close to completing that goal with the remake.</p><p>Also, between Pokemon White, Pokemon X, and Omega Ruby, I have several EV trained and move balanced Pokemon, that I could probably make a decent and competitive league team.  So I might start doing that next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokedex Completion History</b></div><p>Nearly 10 years ago, I picked up Pokemon Emerald and played it quite a bit with my girlfriend at the time.  We started doing this around the time Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green were released, so after we completed Emerald, I bought Fire Red, and she bought Leaf Green.  We ran through both games, and given our position, I suggested we could probably complete the Pokedex between the both of us.</p><p>We got close before giving up.  At the time, there were a possible 386 pokemon.  I think my Emerald pokedex was around 340, or 360, maybe?  For event pokemon, we had a Jirachi, but did not have Mew, Celebi, or Deoxys.</p><p>Then next time I really played Pokemon was when I studied abroad and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were released in Fall 2006.  Later, back in the states, I bought Pokemon Platinum on its release, and went all the way through that game.  Throughout this time, I was collecting each event Pokemon upon its availability.  Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out.  I started going through Soul Silver, but got bored.</p><p>When Pokemon White and Black were released, I actually had a friend who played and cared about the games, too.  I played through White and she played through Black.  We both caught all the exclusive Pokemon and traded them back and forth to complete our Pokedexes.</p><p>At this point, my dream to complete the Pokedex was rekindled.  Starting with Generation III (ruby / sapphire / emerald / leaf green / fire red), you could migrate your Pokemon to the next generation.  So all my Pokemon from Emerald could be moved to Platinum, and from Platinum to Pokemon White.  With my hefty amount of Pokemon from Emerald, and complete saves on Platinum and White, I was able to fill out the new rosters, and get closer.</p><p>I bought some of the older copies of the games to fill out the starters I was missing.  And I even bought a new Nintendo DS, so I could trade and transfer Pokemon between the Gen IV and Gen V games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" /></p><p>This was about 4 years ago.  After the release of Black and White 2, my Pokedex on Pokemon White was at 647 out of 649.  I was missing at Latios, which was available to capture in Pokemon Soul Silver, but I just got so bored playing that game.  And I was missing Meloetta, which was an event Pokemon not yet released.  Almost complete!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Meloetta was released after I starting living in Japan, so I had no way of getting it.  Maybe I had a chance while in Japan, but I missed that opportunity.</p><p>Pokemon X and Y came out last year, bumping the total amount of Pokemon to 718, with an additional 3 event Pokemon yet to be released, announced, or even available in the Pokedex.  Pokemon X was rather boring, though.  There were very few new Pokemon, and the controls were somewhat rocky especially after playing Zelda.  I captured all the Pokemon, though, and during Christmas break, traded back and forth to complete the new set.</p><p>At the time, there was also no built-in way to transfer Gen IV Pokemon to the new games.  Later, an app was released, Pokemon Bank, that allowed you to do this.  I got bored with Pokemon X, so I left it.</p><p>But, ramping up to the release of Omega Ruby, and the release of Diancie, the 719th Pokemon, I started getting into Pokemon again.  I migrated all my Pokemon forward, and filled in any holes I was missing in my Pokedex.  I was now at 717, with only Meloetta and Latios missing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" /></p><p>Playing through Omega Ruby, they basically just give you Latios for free.  You don't even need to battle and catch it.  It felt somewhat empty to have finally catch this Pokemon without even a fight, but whatever.  *My Pokemon X Dex is still at 717, though, because I'm too lazy too transfer it.</p><p>I transferred all my Pokemon over to Omega Ruby, but I do not actually have a living "copy" of Aromatisse and Yveltal (from Pokemon X/Y), so my Omega Ruby Dex is at 716.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing the journey from 10 years ago to 4 years ago to today, these are the games and handhelds I have with me in Japan.  There are still some Pokemon left to capture and transfer from Soul Silver, so I might start playing that again.  My save is just after catching Lugia, and before Victory Road.</p><p>Anyway, <b>I'm so close!</b>  I'm only missing 3 pokemon, and the additional 2 yet unreleased event pokemon.  (Though, #720 Hoppa might be soon.)</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>After playing the shit out of Pokemon White, I became more interested in some of the meta-game aspects of raising and breeding pokemon.  I designed, and started training a balanced EV trained team.  I completely trained 3 pokemon out of the 6 I had planned before I got bored, and gave up.</p><p>I started playing Pokemon X again right before Omega Ruby's release, and EV trained some more pokemon.  EV training is SO easy in Gen VI.  I am so thankful for that.  I completely trained 2 pokemon in that game.</p><p>And with Omega Ruby, I bred and EV trained 4 pokemon in Pokemon X, transferred them to Omega Ruby, and played through all of the game with them.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, with these pokemon, I think I'll make a team, and start competing online.  Why not, right?  With my sole goal of pokemon (finishing the Pokedex) basically complete, I should start getting into the aspect of pokemon that has really kept the franchise alive: battling and competing.</p><p>We'll see, though, maybe I'll lose a lot, get bored, and give up.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next?</b></div><p>I'm super interested to see what they have planned next.  With the addition of Mega evolutions, I think they've pretty much run out of ideas to keep Pokemon fresh.  Pokemon releases are now almost a yearly occurrence.</p><p>2007 = Pokemon Diamond + Pearl<br/>2009 = Pokemon Platinum<br/>2010 = Pokemon Heart Gold + Soul Silver<br/>2011 = Pokemon Black + White<br/>2012 = Pokemon Black + White 2<br/>2013 = Pokemon X + Y<br/>2014 = Pokemon Omega Ruby + Alpha Sapphire</p><p>I could totally see a Pokemon Z (or whatever) coming out in 2015, too.  Maybe that game would bring over all the engine fixes in Omega Ruby, and also correctly bridge the two games.  And perhaps have a lot of good end game content, too.</p><p>But, they really need to take a break.  Pokemon needs some breathing room.</p><p>Anyway, that's my story.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/pokemon">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
