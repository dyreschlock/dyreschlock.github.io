| December 2, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>A month ago, a friend sent me a message about a Photo Rogaining <span class='ja'>フォトロゲイニング</span> event in my town. Photo Rogaining is a somewhat new sport that combines photography and running. It's like a photo scavenger hunt, except you are giving specific locations where to take the photos. The challenge is, by having no prior knowledge of the locations, you must quickly determine a route to reach as many checkpoints as possible, each checkpoint having different point values.</p><p>Prior to his message, I had no idea what this was. <span class='ja'>ロゲイニング</span>? I could not figure out the English word this was trying to be. Logging? Photo Logging? But, Photo Rogaining is the correct English. Rogaining as a sport began in Australia. Its first event was in the 70s. The name Rogaining comes from the 3 folks who invented it: Rod, Gail, and Neil. They just combined their names.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The full title of the event was <b>Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining - Celebrating the 500th Birthday of Nagachika Kanamori</b> -<span class='ja'>金森長近生誕</span>500<span class='ja'>年記念</span>- <span class='ja'>飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング</span>. Kanamori is a very special historical figure for the town. We have a statue of him in the Castle Park.</p><p>Head of the Kanamori Clan, Nagachika led his troops as an arm of the Tokugawa Clan and conquered northern Gifu and eventually Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui. Becoming the daimyo of the area, Kanamori transformed Takayama into a small-sized castle town to encourage tourism of other rich lords. He established what would become modern day Takayama. </p><p>So, the event commemorates the 500th anniversary of his birth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Takayama event was advertised around town a little bit. The starting point as well as the main venue was the Takayama City Historical Museum downtown. The poster had a link to the website for more information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/">https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/</a></p><p>There were 6 different categories of participants: Family Team, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team, Men's Solo, and Women's Solo. The event had a limit of 100 entrees, but we only had around 40 people total? A few didn't show up, but overall I don't think the event was advertised all that well. I'm really glad my friend sent me the info.</p><p>My friend joined a team with his daughter. There were 3 or 4 family teams. The biggest category was the Mixed Teams with 9 separate teams competing. The second biggest category was my category, Men's Solo. We had 6 individuals.</p><p>The schedule was as follows:<br/><b>11:00</b> - Reception<br/><b>12:00</b> - Start<br/><b>15:00</b> - Finish<br/><b>15:30</b> - Awards Ceremony</p><div class='title'><b>Rules</b></div><p>On the Japanese Photo Rogaining site, they listed some general rules. It was not exhaustive, so I didn't completely understand everything. Through the course of the event, I was able to understand the rules better, and now I have a much better grasp of what I could've done to place higher than I did.</p><p>Reception for the event was 11am at the museum. At check-in, we got our bib, number, and a packet with our map, which we were not allowed to open yet. Around 11:30am, they began explaining all the rules for the event. Again, I would've preferred they had all the rules clearly listed, so I could've double checked everything.</p><p>At 11:50am, 10 minutes prior to the start, we could open our maps and look at all of the objectives.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Several points on the map were ones I had guessed earlier, but I had no idea it would push out as far as <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kanon and Matsukura Castle ruins</a>. In reality, it's only 5 or 6km away. Normally isn't that far, but both of these are on the top of a mountain. Steep vertical ascents in a marathon are rough. On the other hand...  63 and 65 points are really high values, along with 43 and 47 on the way.</p><p>I didn't have a lot of time to think or compare this to the other points. I know that I wanted to climb up Shiroyama (castle park) for those points. So, my plan was to get some nearby points, go up Shiroyama for those points, and then push off west for Hida no Sato at least. On my return, I would keep north to grab all of those points before the end.</p><div class='title'><b>Start</b></div><p>As the event began, one of the Solo guys immediately bolted to the stoplight and then west. I kept up with him to the stoplight, but I was going east. </p><p>I grabbed a photo of the rock wall leading up the hill, <b>Point 1</b>, labeled as <span class='ja'>えび坂のお多福</span>. Further east, I snapped a photo of this small park, <b>Point 14</b>, <span class='ja'>川上別邸史跡公園</span>, Kawakami's Historical Second Home park?, on the way to the Bell Tower at Soyu-ji Temple, <b>Point 31</b>, <span class='ja'>宗猷寺鐘堂</span>. I snapped all of these in the first 7 minutes of the race.</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8250_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8253_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8255_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>1 → 14 → 31 // (46 points)</p><p>Next, I wanted to climb Shiroyama <span class='ja'>城山</span> and get those points. Looking back now, I really should've kept going west to grab Point 46, <span class='ja'>道分灯篭</span>. It really wasn't that far away, and those 46 points would've been crucial.</p><p>Starting my climb of Shiroyama, I grabbed a photo of an outer gate of the Kogane Shrine <span class='ja'>黄金神社</span>, <b>Point 7</b>. Behind the shrine is a hiking path that goes directly up to Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span>. I'm not sure too many people knew about that. Way faster than taking the road. In the center of Shiroyama Park is the bronze statue of Kanamori, <b>Point 24</b>, <span class='ja'>長近銅像</span>. This is also where I parked my car. I dumped all my extra packet stuff in my car, and continued.</p><p>Before taking the path up to the Takayama Castle Ruins, I quickly ran over to the nearby Shoren-ji Temple <span class='ja'>照蓮寺</span>, <b>Point 18</b>. The path going up the mountain is pretty steep. Stair, after stair. It's not so bad if you're hiking normally, but in a race, it's rough. I reached the Takayama Castle Ruins <span class='ja'>高山城跡</span>, main building <span class='ja'>本丸跡</span>, <b>Point 23</b>, at 12:25pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="fourColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column fourColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>7 → 24 → 18 → 23 // (+72 points / 118 total)</p><p>There are hiking trails that spider-web themselves throughout Shiroyama.

I have no idea if they'll be run the same way as this one, but I'm game to try.</p><p>I just need to find one that's (1) allows solo participants, (2) not too far away, and (3) not too long. Unless I start doing more training, I think 3 hours is my limit.</p><p>Overall, I loved this event so much. This is my new favorite sport. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Virtual Tokyo Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/virtual-tokyo-marathon">Virtual Tokyo Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Luckily for them, the virus landed under their “acts of god” clause in their contracts, so they didn’t need to issue any refunds. But they had to adapt to the situation, just like everyone else and all other companies in order to stay in business.</p><p>In lieu of being able to do physical marathons, many organizations began to host Virtual marathons, and many of these virtual marathons were free or significantly cheaper than doing them in person. To run them, you needed to download a GPS tracking running app, like Strava, and record a run with the same length as the race within the correct time period.</p><p>These virtual marathons became so frequent and so cheap that throughout 2021 I was running one nearly every weekend. In 2018, I set a new personal record in distance having run a total of 367km in official races over the entire year. I spent nearly $1000 doing this, too. In 2021, I ran 365.6km in all of my races combined, only spending $200. This was an absolute godsend, even though my race times weren’t nearly as good.</p><p>The Tokyo Marathon was a race that had been on my bucket list ever since I started running in Japan. Every year I applied, but every year, I was unable to win the entry lottery for general entry. Much like all other marathons, it had been canceled in 2020 and pushed to 2021. Then canceled again and pushed to 2022. </p><p>Finally, this year, the Tokyo Marathon was finally held again, but only for the elite and career marathon runners. There was no general entry. To make up for this, they added an online component. Anyone who had general entry in the race could participate online for free. Additionally, the general entry became open to everyone for 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. This was finally my chance! Not only that, I only had to run a half marathon rather than a full.</p><p>On March 5th, in the yet still snowy country-side, I ran my half marathon and completed the race. The app was very cumbersome, and I wasn’t really sure if my time actually registered. But today! I got my medal in the mail.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1563_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1564_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220416_tokyo_marathon/IMG_1565_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Perhaps it is not a legitimate Tokyo Marathon medal, but it is good enough for me!

| May 6, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I took part in the Nakagawa Half Marathon <span class='ja'>中川ハーフマラソン</span>, located in a beautiful valley of southern Nagano prefecture <span class='ja'>長野県</span>.  I came across this marathon by browsing through <a href="http://runnet.jp/" title="http://runnet.jp/">runnet.jp</a>, Japan's premiere website for signing up for marathons.  (Very similar to active.com in the states.)  Unlike the Takaoka Marathon, which I've "run" twice now (<a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">Nov 18th, 2013</a>, <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2" title="/takaoka-marathon-2">Jun 18th, 2014</a>), this was much more laid back and treated as a community event, rather than an athletic competition.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" /></p><p>They actually had a marathon expo prior to the event where people could do packet pick-up.  I was unable to make it there the day before, so I went the morning of the marathon.  Packet Pick-up was quite smooth.  With each packet, you could enter a raffle to win several local goods.  I won an apple.</p><p>Inside the packet was a bunch of advertisement, and coupons.  Also included is the marathon "program" which includes a list of ALL participants.  The Takaoka Marathon did this, too.  Looking through the list, I was one of only 3 or 4 foreign participants, out of the entire ~3000 person list.  They gave out 2 bibs, too.  The front one contains the timing chip.  The back one shows which prefecture you've come from.</p><div class='title'><b>Opening Ceremony errata</b></div><p>On the day of the race, the expo was open from 7:00am to 8:20am.  At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" /></p><p>This lasted 40 minutes. :/  The speakers didn't take all that long, but the special guests absorbed a ton of time.  Musical guest: Parallel Dream came to cheer us on.  This is an idol group from Nagano.  And M<span class='ja'>高史</span> (Takashi), which is apparently some kind of famous runner, or a comedian, or both? I dunno.</p><p>They entertained the crowd, and then everyone did the morning exercise routine.  I left and wandered around.</p><p>The race finally began at 9:30am.  I really miss the 7:00am start times in America.</p><div class='title'><b>The Course</b></div><p>M<span class='ja'>高史</span> fired the starting pistol, and then started giving everyone high-fives as they ran passed him.  It was SO congested, I don't think I started actually running until 1km in.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" /></p><p>For the first 3.5km, it was completely uphill.  We started at 470m above sea level, and kept climbing and climbing.  At 3.5km, we reached the highest point in the marathon, 620m.</p><p>The view along the way was great.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going downhill is so much easier.  Gravity does most of the work. :)  But, it was still too congested to actually glide down the hill.  And now we were running against the people behind us still climbing the hill.</p><p>Just past the 4km mark, the last person went by, and road width essentially doubled.  I launched myself into the other lane, and somewhat leapt down the hill.  Stride, stride, stride.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We continued down through a neighborhood and past several bridges.  The roads weren't completely shut down, so some cars would drive by, and try to make it through the packs of people.</p><p>Around the 8km, the "bottom" of the course became visible.  The lowest point of 420m, which were flat farm plots.  You were able to see almost everyone in front of you, and the direction of the course.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When running marathons, I really prefer to think about the course one mile, or one kilometer at a time.  I like knowing which mile or kilometer I'm running, but being able to see the entire course is just too much to take in.  "I need to run all of that?!"  And there are so many people in front of me.  Bleh…</p><p>On top of that, the course zig-zags around the rice fields, rather than going in a straight line.  It's somewhat demoralizing when a course doesn't take the most efficient route.  It feels like I'm wasting time, rather than getting to the finish as fast as I can.</p><p>It's quite beautiful, though. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last leg of the course was an uphill climb to the finish line.  At this point, it was nice to look back and see the course, and remind myself just how far I've traveled.  Seeing the course here is way more rewarding rather than seeing it near the middle of the run.</p><p>Only a short kilometer or two remaining, until crossing the finish line.  After crossing the finish line, they drape you in a large tower with the marathon's logo on it.  Really nice.  My time was 2 hours 40 minutes 13 seconds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not bad. :)  I did a bit better than I thought I would.  Continuing back to the expo hall, you could take some bottled water, fruit, and other post-race food.  Like an actual marathon back in the states!</p><p>Overall, I really liked this race.  It went through some beautiful scenery, and with the 3 hour limit, there were many more casual racers, rather than a legion of athletes.  The race was nice and casual, and was very fun.  This race was the most like any marathon I've done back in the states.  Very positive, and fun.</p><p>I'll definitely do this again next time.</p><p><u>Update (June 25th):</u>  Man.. I have been 100% sick since doing this race.  I've been coughing every day, and my lungs are constantly full of flem.  Ech.  I most've inhaled pollen or dust or something airborne during this race that has ruined my lungs. :(</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon 2014" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2">Takaoka Marathon 2014</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 18, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I attended the Takaoka Half Marathon for the second time.  Last year, the race was in November, and it was a much cooler day.  I wrote about that here: <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">November 18th</a>.  </p><p>Last year, although, I trained and was in alright shape, the time limits set by the race prevented me from finishing.  I made it to the 17.3km gate at 1 minute too late.  So, I definitely planned on signing up again and vowing to complete the marathon!</p><div class='title'><b>This Year</b></div><p>Well, I did not train nearly as much as I did last year.  Last year, there were other people I signed up with, and we trained a few times together, and had some fun.  We were a team.  This year, it was just me.  And I had been so busy and tired with school that I barely trained at all.  I am still doing Kendo, but even then, I still occasionally miss Kendo practice due to the amount work needed to teach at my schools.</p><p>So, I was not nearly in the shape I was last year.  I was totally prepared for not finishing.  In fact, my time probably would've been better spent had I simply skipped the event.  But whatever…  I'll still drive down there, and make it as far as I can.</p><div class='title'><b>The Race</b></div><p>This year's course was identical to last year's.  Of course, this year it was in June, rather than November.  The morning wasn't too bad.  There was a nice breeze, and the clouds prevented the sun from heating everyone up.</p><p>At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony, where the Takaoka athletic association said some words, and last year's winners came up to the front and said their words, too.  Blah blah blah, I have no idea what they said.</p><p>After the opening ceremony, the half marathon race was the first to gather at the starting line.  Then the clouds started to open up and let the sun in.  Ugh, it was hot.  At 9am, some old guy fired his starting pistol and everyone was off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Limits</b></div><p>Once again, just like last year, the race had a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This limit is enforced by 2 intermediary checkpoints throughout the race.  The first checkpoint is at 12.7km for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The second checkpoint is at 17.3km for 2 hours.  If you make it to these checkpoints late, the volunteers will stop you, and force you to quite.  Then you must wait for a bus to pick you up and bring you back to the start.  </p><p>Last year, I made the first checkpoint, but could not pass the second one.  I was only 1 minute late. :/</p><p>With the shape I was in this year, I had no intention of doing any better.  In order to complete the checkpoints, and the race, I needed to keep a pace of less than 7 minutes per kilometer (that's around 11 minutes per mile).</p><p>Whatever… let's get this marathon over with.</p><div class='title'><b>Running</b></div><p>Again, the course was the same.  But, since I was running at a much more leisurely pace, I stopped to take a few more photos than last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" /></p><p>I really tried at the beginning, but after 2k, my body was too fat, and heavy, and I was not going to have the energy to overcome it.  Additionally, I kept thinking about all the crap still outstanding on my to-do list, and the increasingly little time I had to complete them.  Ugh, why am I here?  Why am I doing this?  This isn't fun.  I'm not really getting anything out of this either.</p><p>The increasing pressure of all my responsibilities kept me from actually enjoying the run, and thinking about things clearly.  Usually during a marathon, I can push away all of my thoughts, empty my mind, and think about things without any noise.  My brain stops trying to analyze everything, and I can simply think…</p><p>All I could think about were my upcoming classes, and all the preparation work I still needed to do, and try to figure out when I could actually do the work.  And then think about my classes after, and how was I going to have the energy to do any of this after running this race.</p><p>So, this marathon sucked, and I did terrible at it.  Though, there were a few sparing moments I could lose myself in my music, but then came the crushing reality of my fat ass.</p><div class='title'><b>"Finishing"</b></div><p>Anyway, at around 10 o'clock, I passed the 9km marker.  I quickly thought to myself that I was still alright for time.  Only 3km left to the 12km checkpoint.  I can make that in 30 minutes.  15 minutes later, I remembered that the checkpoint was actually 12.7km, and that my pace was terrible.</p><p>I passed the 12km before the 10:30 mark, but arrived at the checkpoint more than 6 minutes late.</p><p>Whooo, failure!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't the only one there, and there were still people behind me, too.  I still have not broken my cardinal rule of not placing last in a race.  I was only 7th or 8th from last!</p><p>Once everyone else behind us got to the checkpoint, the bus of shame arrived to transport everyone back to the start.  We traversed the course backwards, and made it back to the start before 11am.  So, there were still people finishing the race as we arrived.  Our tracking chips were returned in the bus, though, so we couldn't just jump back on the track and finish the race. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" /></p><p>So, while I didn't finish the race, and did much more horribly than last year, I was able to leave much earlier and not damage my legs too much.  The race was still finishing as I walked back to my car to return to Takayama.</p><div class='title'><b>Vow</b></div><p>I still vow to complete this race in the future!  I wonder if this race happens twice a year, which explains the date change from last year.  November was way more comfortable to run, too.  The heat was terrible for this race. :(</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon">Takaoka Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I came to Japan to work, I had 3 goals for the year.  One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Running in 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/running-in-2011">Running in 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 9, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I ran my first Half Marathon of the 2011 Season.  And by Season, I mean an somewhat arbitrary range of dates to split up my winter races and non-winter races.  Training is much more difficult in the winter, so I don't want my winter times bringing down my non-winter times.</p><div class='title'><b>Seasons</b></div><p>What I am defining as the 2011 Running Season is basically Last April to Late October.  This is just for the Midwest and like-climates though.  Warmer climates would make it much easier to train and run all year round, so the "season" would probably just be the entire year.</p><p>For me, the season began last weekend with Madison's annual Crazy Legs Classic.  It's a 8 kilometer run from Capitol Square, through UW-Madison campus, and ending on Randal Field.  It's a really good start for the year, and the entire town really gets into it.  Almost 10,000 runners competed this year.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting back into Running</b></div><p>I did much better than last year, but I felt incredibly sluggish.  Winter makes it nearly impossible for me to train.  I can't train outside because it's too cold, and I can't train inside because it's too boring.  Before hitting the pavement back in March, I hadn't done any running at all since the Seattle Half Marathon and the Sandbox Indoor Half Marathon.  </p><p>Getting back into the work out is hard.  It was still cold out, so I wasn't getting any positive vibes from the sun.  And I felt horrible after each run.  I didn't feel like I was getting any benefit from it at all.  But there's one thing I've learned from running over the past 2 years.  <b>Motivation builds off of itself.</b>  </p><p>I know that running is beneficial for me, so I had to force myself to get out there and do it.  For April, I was outside every other day, and still felt like I wasn't getting any from it, but I kept doing it.</p><p>My Crazy Legs time wasn't the greatest (50 minutes), but I did better than last year.  Later in the week on Wednesday, the sun was out and shining, and I had an amazing run that day.  I was actually starting to feel some of the benefits of running, even though I still felt like crap.</p><div class='title'><b>Door County Half Marathon</b></div><p>This past weekend, I ran in the Door County Half Marathon, and going into it, I wasn't feeling very optimistic.  I still felt sluggish, and figured I would get a 2:30, or something.  But that wasn't the case.  I pushed forward, and actually started feeling really good.  In the middle of the race, my legs started matching pace with what I was capable of last year.  I was flying down hills, and able to build off of specific songs I was listening to.  I glided across the finish line and achieved a 2:20:02.</p><p>2:20 isn't my best time, but it is much faster than where I was at last year at this time.  My 2010 time for Door County was 2:34, and it was the first race where I really pushed myself.  I figured I would be around the same time this year, but I feel great that I was able to retain much of the speed I was working towards last year.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Getting a decent time (for me) has given me new motivation to continue to run, and do much better than last year.  I have 3 goals this year, but they all lead to the same thing.  1) I want to surpass my high score of 2:13.  2) I want to surpass 2:03, which is the world record for the FULL marathon.  and 3) I want to surpass 2 hours.  So, even though, they are 3 separate goals, they are really the same goal.  I guess "milestones" would be a better way to describe it.</p><p>Currently, I'm signed up for 2 more half marathons this year, but I'm sure I'll sign up for more as time goes on.</p><p>May 29th // Madison Half Marathon<br/>Aug 20th // Madison Mini-Marathon</p><p>Additionally, I signed up for my first FULL marathon, which is Milwaukee's Lakefront Marathon.  I was actually planning on signing up last year, but it was completely full by the time I decided to do so.  That takes place on October 2nd, so there is plenty of time to train and build up to it.</p><p>Run run run!</p><p>Also, if you're wondering, I keep track of all my racing times through Google Docs.  Here's a public link for that information:<br/><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html" title="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html">https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&output=html</a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Running 2010" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/running-2010">Running 2010</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 31, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I completed the Haunted Hustle Half Marathon in Middleton, WI, which basically closes out the year for midwest running events (for me, anyways).  I still have another race before the end of the year, but that's in Seattle over Thanksgiving.</p><p>It's starting to get colder during the day and darker in the evenings, which makes it really difficult to run.  Something that I've learned this year is that I thrive on the positive energy of the sun to run fast and run well.  It excites all the molecules in my skin, gives me a warm refreshing glow, and I just glide along whatever track I'm on.  The cold weather makes running feel like work.</p><p>The Haunted Hustle Half Marathon was more difficult for me than previous races because of the frigid weather.  My legs felt stiff throughout the whole race.  My shoulder started cramping up a couple times.  The entire race just felt like an uphill battle.  Like I was dragging some extra weight behind me.</p><p>I'm actually really surprised by my final result.  I clocked in at 2:14:12.  The whole race I felt so far behind, but I really only finished 30 seconds after my best time ever.  Not too bad after all.</p><p>I've been keeping track of my running times and paces using Google Docs.  Here's a link to the spreadsheet: <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html" title="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0Ak9hIdYBQ74MdFRZekVmTVJCblFGTEZRaXRuRlN3Smc&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html">Google Doc!</a></p><p>This year I've done 6 Half Marathons, though I don't really count the Florida one because I was way out of shape.  With the exception of the Haunted Hustle, each time had progressively crushed my previous best.  From the times I had when I first started running last year up until now, I've shaved off 30 minutes.</p><p>I think that's an incredible amount of improvement.  So much so, that I really wonder what the hell I was doing last year.  At the time, I was really only concerned with completing the race, but it feels so lazy thinking back.  I really could have done better.</p><p>Oh well, I didn't really care about times last year.  I care about them now.  I feel like I can do better than 2:13, and I'll continue to run and push myself until I find the best time I can possibly do.  And when that happens, I might finally graduate to a full marathon.</p><p>My next race is the Seattle Half Marathon, which takes place over Thanksgiving weekend.  Seeing how my last two times were pretty consistent, I intend to keep that consistency or do better.  Though, If I do worse and it's cold out, I'll probably just blame it on that.</p><p>Next year, I'm definitely continuing my running habits.  I'll run in many of the same Half Marathon events and a couple other ones.  I might even sign up for Milwaukee's Lakefront Marathon as my first Full Marathon.</p><p>One more and I'll be at 10!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/medals.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/medals.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/medals.webp"  /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Motivation to Run" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/motivation-to-run">Motivation to Run</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning I ran my 3rd Half Marathon.  I finished around the same time as previously, but just a little bit quicker.  In the Madison Half Marathon, I finished at 2 hours 50 minutes, but it was probably closer to <b>2 hours 48 minutes</b>, as it took 2 minutes to cross the starting line.  I finished the Madison Mini Marathon is <b>2 hours 45 minutes</b>.  And today, I finished the Fox Cities Marathon is <b>2 hours 43 minutes</b>.</p><p>After finishing my first Half Marathon, I wrote about why I <a href="/old/v7/run-run-run" title="/run-run-run">decided to Run</a>. Spoiler! I saw the movie, Run Fatboy Run, and thought it looked pretty easy.  And it wasn't too difficult.  That first half marathon beat the shit out of me, but it gave me perspective and motivation for fitness.</p><div class='title'><b>Motivation</b></div><p>Motivation is the reason I signed up for another 2 Half Marathon right after finishing the first.  Motivation to continue running on my own and exercise regularly.  Overall, I run to lose weight and keep fit.  I like to be light on my feet.  But running builds Motivation of its own.  The energy spent and built while running keeps the body in motion throughout the day.  It eases my lazy tendencies and lightens my mood.  The cycle of exercise and motivation to exercise is just as powerful as the cycle to sit there and not exercise.</p><p>During a marathon, that motivation is far greater because you're surrounded by thousands of other people that have the motivation to get out of bed on very early weekend morning and run for a few hours as the sunrises.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" /></p><p>Everyone is there for different reasons, but those reasons give them the same motivation that guides their feat across the pavement and eventually across the finish line.  And at the finish line you're given a medal for you hard work.  There are few exercises that will award with a medal on top of the health, fitness and perpetual motivation.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>The daylight continues to escape the skies, the leaves have started to wither and rot, and the temperature is declining.  Fall is here and my weekends are rather busy, so I don't have the time to take in any more half marathons this year.

I started "training" back in March this year, so the cold shouldn't keep me away.

| May 26, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About 3 months ago, I saw a movie entitled <b>Run Fat Boy Run</b> starring and written by Simon Pegg and also written by Michael Ian Black.</p><p>Simon Pegg's character is slightly depressed and had gained a bit of weight since he left he fiance at the alter five years ago.  Now his fiance is dating Hank Azaria who is one of those guys that is good at everything.  Hank Azaria is fit and healthy and plans to run the London Marathon is a couple of months.  Not to be out done by the likes of him, Simon Pegg vows to run the marathon, too.</p><p>The "comedy" of this movie is how a lazy dude like Simon Pegg gets in shape for the marathon.  And the "development" of his character is what he learns on the way.  His friends are supportive and pitch in to point Simon Pegg back on the healthy track of life.</p><p>Overall, I thought the movie used a lot of tired jokes, relied too much on physical humor and wasn't very original.  One thing was very clear in the movie, though.  For Simon Pegg, running the marathon would ultimately solved all his problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Hmmm...  solved all his problems, eh?</b></div><p>Maybe I'm a little too impressionable by movies and video games, but the cogs of thought started spinning around in my head.</p><p>First off, distances on foot really don't intimidate me.  While living in Japan, I walked up the side of a mountain almost everyday to get to school.  Also, when the bus sees fit to leave downtown without me, I've walked the 3.5 miles to work without a problem.</p><p>Ok, 26 miles is kinda far, but a 13 mile half marathon?  I could easily traverse that.</p><p>Secondly, I need some manor of exercise in my life.  Walking everywhere is nice, but it's no where near a full workout.  DDR is too inconvenient at my apartment and there are no machines nearby.  I don't really like biking.  I like running around the neighborhood, but I lack the motivation.</p><p>I figure that signing up for a marathon would give me the motivation to stick with a regular routine of running/jogging and provide some actually exercise in my life.</p><p>Those 2 reasons were why I signed up for the Madison Half Marathon.  It sounded easy and would get me to exercise.  To clinch my dedication to the race, I asked Dave if he'd run the marathon with me.  He's also looking for excuses to exercise.</p><p>We estimated our finish time at <b>3 hours 1 second</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Training</b></div><p>In Run Fat Boy Run, Simon Pegg has 3 months to get in shape before the London Full Marathon.  My time was a little bit shorter than that.  I had 9 weeks after I signed up.  That really didn't bother me though.  I wasn't going to delude myself into thinking that I could keep a running pace during the entire thing.  I was quite certain that I would be walking the better part of the race.</p><p>That was pretty much my pace during training.  Run run run until I ran out of breath, walk until I caught my breath, then run run run again.  On, off, on off.  Every time I went jogging, my initial run would get longer and longer.  My goal was to get to the point where I'd be able to make it through the entire course without walking.  I was able to run nearly 75% of my 1.5 mile course before I expanded it to 3.4 miles.</p><p>Run run run.  I got slightly better each time.  A minute faster here, a minute faster there.</p><p>Previously I gave up running after a week because I wasn't feeling any different.  After a month of running around, I wasn't starting to feel some of the benefits.  My energy was up and my thighs were as lean as they were in my DDR haydays.  I didn't lose much weight, but I probably could if I changed my diet slightly.</p><div class='title'><b>"Running" the marathon</b></div><p>The day finally came.  Sunday morning, at 7am, Dave and I drove to the Alliant Energy Center, safety-pinned our numbers to our shirts, and lined up at the starting line with 3700 other people.  Gawd, it was freezing outside.  It was around 55 degrees and all we had on were these running shorts and a shirt.</p><p>But after the starting horn was bleeted and we ran consistently for about 2 miles, the cold weather was perfect.  Run, walk, run, walk, run, walk longer, run, walk longer.  Much like I figured, the half marathon wasn't difficult.  It was only 4 times the length of what I had done during training.</p><p>During the race, Dave and I chatted about other upcoming marathons.  We agreed that a Full Marathon is a too far for us for now, but were definitely interested in more Half Marathons.</p><p>The course for the Half Marathon was quite pretty. ^_^  It took us all over Madison, from Monona Bay, to St. Mary's Hospital, to Camp Randall, to the Agriculture area of UWMadison.  We went along the coastline of Lake Mendota, to Memorial Union.  Along Langdon St to James Madison Park up to Tenney Park, where we turned South East.  We went underneath East Washington and turned South West along Jenifer St.  From there, we met up with John Nolen Dr. and followed the coast of Lake Monona back to the Colliseum.  If you want a great tour of Madison, this Marathon is perfect.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>We screwed up our timing chips, so Dave and I don't have official results, but I remembered what the clock said when I passed the finish line.</p><p>I finished the Half Marathon at <b>2 hours 49 minutes and 56 seconds</b>.  And Dave finished about 10 seconds later.  Overall, we placed around 3450 out of 3700.  Whooo!  Not last.</p><p>Unlike Simon Pegg, the Marathon didn't solve all my problems.  But It definitely gave me the motivation to keep with an exercise routine.  Something that I've wanted for a while now.</p><p>Plus, I got a medal!  Yeah yeah, everyone gets a medal.  But it's more than a medal of participation, it's a medal of completion.  It's also more than just completing the marathon, it's also the 2 months of work I've put into myself leading up to the Marathon.  For the first time since college, I've actually lost some weight, rather than hovering around the same numbers.  I have more energy.  There's that feeling of accomplishment, too.</p><p>I worked out for 2 months, ran/walked further than I had at a given point in time, and got a medal for it!  Hot damn!  All because of a stupid movie.</p><p>Thanks Simon Pegg and Michael Ian Black ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>2:49:56 is a start.  And it's pretty good for first-timers + only 2 months of training.  But, hell, we can definitely do better.  I was 6th from last for my age group.</p><p>Dave and I signed up for 2 more Half Marathons this year.  The <a href="http://www.madisonminimarathon.com" title="http://www.madisonminimarathon.com">Madison Mini-Marathon</a> and the <a href="http://www.foxcitiesmarathon.org" title="http://www.foxcitiesmarathon.org">Fox Cities Half Marathon</a>.</p><p>The Madison Mini-Marathon course is another great introduction to some of the areas of Madison.  It actually goes up to Capitol Square, and then continues all the way down to Lake Wingra and back again.  It starts 7am on Saturday August 29th.</p><p>The Fox Cities Marathon starts in Appleton, goes through Mensha and ends in Neenah.  Should be interesting. ^_^ That one is 7am on Sunday September 20th.</p><p>Maybe next year, we'll have the strength to complete an actual Full Marathon.  Baby steps.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a
